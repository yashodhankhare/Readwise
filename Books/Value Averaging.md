## Highlights
- The power of the value averaging method derives from its marriage of two proven but heretofore separate techniques: dollar cost averaging and portfolio rebalancing. The mathematical imperative of dollar cost averaging, the time-honored purchase of equal, periodic amounts of stocks, forces investors to buy more shares of stock or mutual funds when prices are low than when they are high, increasing overall returns, on average. Rebalancing, on the other hand, is most often applied to mature portfolios and mandates the periodic adjustment of portfolio allocations back to a set policy, forcing a strong element of “buy-low/sell-high” discipline into an investor’s trading decision making. Mike’s special genius lay in realizing ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=121))

- that these two techniques could be combined in the accumulation phase of a portfolio; not only are more shares bought when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, as with dollar cost averaging, but more money is deployed into stocks when prices are low and less when prices are high, producing yet more salutary long-term results. Any investor fortunate enough to have come across Value Averaging during the 1990s and absorb its message was amply rewarded; prices defied both logic and gravity as that fateful decade wore on, and the technique told its practitioners to invest progressively less money on high-priced equity. Then, as prices plunged between 2000 and 2002, the hoards of capital accumulated during the previous several years was used to purchase shares at bargain-basement prices.

- No investment technique, of course, works 100 percent of the time. Regular portfolio rebalancing, for example, usually increases portfolio returns, but it does not always do so. When markets move strongly up or down for a long period of time, such as occurred during the 1990s in the United States (up) and in Japan (down), rebalancing can hurt portfolio returns by the continuous purchases of a falling asset or the continuous sales of a rising asset. The same is also true of value averaging into an asset class over a period of relatively few years in a generally rising market, in which case the investor would have been better off purchasing a single lump sum. Most… ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=133))

- misjudging the long-term market return, one of the technique’s central inputs. Grossly overestimating this value will result in the purchase of too much stock, possibly exceeding the saving capacity of the investor, whereas grossly underestimating this value will result in too little stock being purchased. The past few decades have seen a tectonic shift in the retirement landscape, with the replacement of the traditional definedbenefit retirement plan with a slew of defined-contribution schemes, prime among which is the 401 (k) account.

Perhaps you can pick securities as well as Warren Buffett, but if you are unable to put away a substantial percentage of your income, you are doomed. Second, and just as important, you must be able to execute. The discipline of value averaging mandates that when everyone around you has panicked, not only must you keep your head and continue to purchase stocks, you must do so in far larger amounts than in more normal times.

- A formula strategy is any predetermined plan that will “mechanically” guide your investing. One very naive such formula, for example, is to buy one share of stock every week (not recommended!). The best-known formula plan, discussed in Chapter 2, is dollar cost averaging, whereby you invest the same amount of money in an asset each regular investment period, regardless of its price. A flexible variation of this is value averaging, a strategy I devised in 1988. The basic formula of value averaging, discussed more fully in Chapter 3, is to invest whatever is needed to make the value of your asset holdings increase by ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=299))

- A return on investment (e.g., 8%) must be connected with a period of time (e.g., a year). Annual terms are commonly used, but not always. When we shift our concern from one time period to a different one, we must “translate” the return figure as well. Suppose the total return on a 2-year investment was 21%. A natural way of stating this would be to convert the 2-year return into an annual figure—a 1-year return. But simply dividing the 21% by 2, yielding an annual return figure of 10.50%, would be incorrect. Simple “averaging” of a return ignores compounding. Suppose you had a $100 two-year investment, and made a 10.50% return on it in the first year. That gives you $110.50. With another 10.50% return in the second year, you end up with $122.10 (10.50% of $110.50 is $11.60). This is a 2-year return of 22.10%, not just 21 %. Actually, a 21% two-year return is equivalent to a 10% annual return ($100 + 10% = $110; $110 + 10% = $121, a 21 % total return). ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=355))

- If a is the annual return, then this formula will give you the compound return for n-years: (1 + a)n = 1 + n-year return In the example above, a = 10% and n = 2, so: (1 + 0.10)2 = 1.21 = 1 + n-year return 0.21 = 21 % = 2-year return The process works in reverse, too, to find the annual return given a longerperiod return. Taking the n-th root (on a calculator, that’s raising something to the 1/n power), the formula is: 1 + a = n-th root(1 + n-year return) ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=363))

- or, 1 + a = (1 + n-year return)1/n EXAMPLE: What annual rate gets you a 50% return over five years? 1 + a = 5-th root(1 + 0.50) = (1.50).2 = 1.0845 a = 8.45% annual return This process can also be used for calculating compound returns for periods that are less than a year in length. Using the top formula, what is the monthly compound return if you get a 12% annual return? HINT: One month is 1/12 of one year.

- (1 + 0.12)1/12 = 1.0095 = 1 + monthly return 0.0095 = 0.95% = monthly return A more general way to write the formula is helpful in translating monthly rates into annual. Suppose that your long time period is n times as long as your short time period. Then the per period compound returns are related as follows: (1 + short period return)n = 1 + long period return Suppose you could earn 1.0% each month on an investment. What is the annual return? Here, the short period return is 0.01, and n = 12: (1.01)12 = 1.1268 = 1 + long (annual) return 0.1268 = 12.68% = annual return ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=381))

- evident in Figure 1-4a, where instead of looking at one-year investments, we look at four-year periods. Only the worst period (the Great Depression) shows a loss. The annualized return over longer time periods is less variable, because the randomness of the returns causes them to “average out.” ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=394))

- Let’s have a look at the historical data on market gains and losses—it is quite interesting and instructive. There were 792 months of market return data between 1926 and 1991; also, daily data were analyzed from the period July 1962 to December 1991. The results are tabulated in Table 1-1. Almost 55% of the daily returns were positive—in a typical 22-day month, the market would have had 12 up days and 10 down days. For longer periods, note the increasing probability of a gain in the market over that period. The market tends to rise over time. Over just a brief instant of “market time,” this trend is indiscernible. Over a full day, you can see the tendency, but the random “bounce” around the trend still causes a large number (45½%) of down periods. But as we allow more time, the upward trend compounds, while at the same time the random bounces average each other out. So as time increases, we are more assured of getting a positive return out of the market.

- market explains the typical advice from investment advisors to put into the stock market only your “five-year-andout” funds. That is, if you might need access to your funds within the next five years or sooner, it may not all still be there (if invested in the stock market) due to risk of loss; but funds invested for longer periods are less likely to experience a loss.

- We can also look at the actual distribution of returns over various time periods to develop a better sense of the risk of the marketplace. A histogram, or bar chart, of annual returns is shown in Figure 1-5, which has a different format from the previous ones; now the annual return is shown along the horizontal axis. The number of times that a particular return occurs is on the vertical axis. The annual returns are grouped into ranges of five percentage points. Reading from left to right, we see that there was one year during which the return was below −40%, one year when it was between −35% and −30%, and two years when it fell by −30% to −25%. You can verify this by looking again at the time series of annual returns in Figure 1-3 above. Note that even though the distribution is centered over the 12% average annual return, the actual return has fallen in the +10% to +15% range during only four years out of the 66 years in the sample. Thus, if one were to say “The expected return on the market is 12%,” this would not mean that we really expect the return to be +12%. Instead, this statement of expectation really means that on aver age, we expect the random returns to vary around (or to center on) +12%. After the fact, of course, we can disparage any such predictions, but this does not mean there is no need for (or value in) making reasoned predictions at all.

- What about the future? Do the 66 years of returns analyzed portend a 12% expected annual return for the future? Not quite. First, there is no guarantee that the next 66 years will be anything like the past. Second, it is the relative return, not the absolute return, that gives us potentially useful information from past results. That is, if the basic risk differences between stocks and bonds persist into the future, then the basic return differences between them will probably continue as well. Higher returns will be demanded by investors to take the higher risk inherent in stocks, so, on average, stocks will have to give higher returns than bonds. The most relevant number to project into the future seems to be the 7% difference between common stock and government bond returns. With long-term government bond rates at 7-8% as of 1992, this would make the expected return on the stock market 14-15%. Although the assumptions that go into this projected return are reasonable, different sets of assumptions could result in very reasonable market return projections in the 12% to 16% range. Now we can factor in the expected risk with this expected return to get a rough assessment of the probability of likely outcomes if you are invested in the stock market. Annual returns in the market had a standard deviation of 20.8% over the period analyzed. (See “Risk and Standard Deviation” in the box on page 17.)

- For a normal distribution, about two-thirds of repeated outcomes will fall into a range within one standard deviation of the average. That is, about two-thirds of the area under the relative likelihood curve would occur between −1 and +1 for the standard normal distribution as shown in Figure 1-9. For stock returns, about two-thirds of the years’ returns should fall into a range within one standard deviation of the average; for the past, this is roughly between −9% and +33%, using 12% as the center. Likewise, about 95% of the returns should fall into a range within two standard deviations on either side of the average. So what’s likely to happen in future years in the stock market? Using the reasonable expectations of a 15% return and a 20% standard deviation around that expected return, we can make these reasoned guesses as to the probability of future market outcomes (see Figure 1-10): • The return should be between −5% and +35% in roughly two out of three years. • The return should be between −25% and +55% in all but one out of twenty years. • You will make more than the 6% T-note rate about 67% of the time (two out of three years).

- Whenever an outcome (such as next year’s return on the stock market) is random, it could take on many likely values. These outcomes or possible values have some expected value—also called the mean or average or center—around which they might “fall.” Suppose this average is 15%; that means that the possible outcomes, while random, will center on 15%. It would be nice to know how closely the possible returns occur near the average. If the spread of possible random returns is very large—say, if −50% and +60% returns were very likely—then we would say that the distribution of the random returns around their expected value (average) is very risky. The risk is that the actual outcome could end up very far (in either direction) from the expected value. In a less risky distribution, perhaps values outside the 0% to 30% range would be highly unlikely. One way to measure this risk is called the standard deviation. This measure is, loosely, the typical distance (deviation) of the random value from their expected value (center). To be 1 standard deviation away from the average is not an unusual occurrence; to be 2 standard deviations away is unusual; to be 3 standard deviations away is quite rare. More exactly, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance; the variance is the average squared-distance from the expected value. A function (@std) in most spreadsheet packages will calculate the standard deviation of any range for you. The standard deviation is in the same units as the average—percent, in the case of stock returns. Figure 1-9 is a sketch of the standard normal distribution showing the relative likelihood of a random outcome compared to its expected value. Random outcomes are shown along the bottom scale, in terms of how far (how many standard deviations away) they are from the expected value or center. Note that it is most likely that random outcomes are near their expected value, and less and less likely to occur the further they are from their expected value. The probability that an outcome will fall in a particular range… ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=489))

- Thus, a standard deviation is simply a measure of spread that allows us to “standardize” how far random values are spread about their center. This is useful for assessing the likelihood of various stock returns. Figure 1-10 shows one possible random distribution of stock market returns, using the numbers in the text for center (15% expected return) and spread (20% standard deviation). The possible annual returns along the bottom of the sketch are marked in one standard deviation intervals (… ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=509))

- investment is only about 6%-7%. • Over a ten-year period, the odds are 7-to-1 that your market return will average better than the current long-term government bond interest rate. • The market will have a “big year” of a 25% or higher gain roughly every three years. These numbers are nothing more than educated guesses backed up by reasonable assumptions and analyses. They are not meant to entice or scare you, only to give you some estimate of what you’re getting into. Note that these numbers apply to the returns (including dividends) on the market as a whole, and not to a particular stock, industry, or other undiversified investment.

- Throughout this book, the terms rate of return, internal rate of return, and IRR are used to describe the investment performance of a particular strategy or of any set of cash flows. A good way to think about this IRR measure is that it is the fixed yield you would have to earn on a bank account that receives all of your investment inflows in order to match the performance of your investment (that is, produce the resulting outflows). As an example, look at the cash flows for the fund investment in Table 2-1. You put in $100 a ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=664))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- month (inflow), getting a wildly random return, finally resulting in a value of $2,502 (outflow). What kind of (fixed) bank rate of return would have produced the same results? Since the investments were at monthly intervals, we must use monthly rates. Try 0.5% first (6.17% annually): If you’d invested $100 each month at this monthly rate, you would have accrued $2,556 after 2 years. Your investment only achieved $2,502, though, so your IRR must have been below 0.5% monthly. Trying 0.3%, the result would be $2,492—you did better than this, so your IRR is above 0.3% monthly. It turns out that 0.33% monthly would have accumulated about $2,502, so we say that the internal rate of return (IRR) is 0.33% monthly, ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=668))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- which is 4.03% annually. We generally convert the IRR so that we consistently quote it in annual terms (see box on converting rates in Chapter 1 on page 7). Remember that the IRR is simply that rate of return that would have provided the same cash flows or investment results as the investment that you’re analyzing. Thus, it can apply in situations with different cash flows that are more complex than the DCA example just examined. Suppose in 1987 (assume all cash flows occur at the beginning of each year) you invested $1,000 and received a $60 dividend a year later. Then in 1989 you received another ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=673))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- $60 dividend, but invested another $500. You then sell most of your shares for $900 in 1990, and the remainder of your shares are valued at $802 a year later in 1991. Your net cash flows, at 1-year intervals, are: 1987 − $1,000 1988 + 60 1989 − 440 1990 + 900 1991 + 802 ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=678))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- By trial and error you can calculate the IRR to be 7.5% annually. That is, if the cash flows had all earned 7.5% each year, all the inflows and outflows would be accounted for. Suppose you had $1,000 in a bank at 7.5%—could you replicate these cash flows exactly? $1,000 at 7.5% gives you $1,075 by 1988, or $1,015 after taking out $60. That $1,015 grows to $1,091 by 1989; then adding $440 makes balance $1,531, which grows at 7.5% interest to $1,646 in 1990. Taking out $900 leaves you with $746, which grows to $802 by 1991. Take out $802 and the “account” has provided all of the required cash flows. Thus 7.5% was the correct figure for the internal rate of return.

- The average share price reduction provided by dollar cost averaging gives you a reasonable chance at enhancing your investment rate of return over short- and medium-term investment periods. But as you can see, it plays very little role in your overall return, compared with the performance of your investment. That is, a bad year is a bad year, even with dollar cost averaging. The investment vehicle you choose (and how ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=725))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- it fares) is far more important to your results than the mechanical rules you follow to invest in it. To that end, the best use of dollar cost averaging is for very diversified investments, such as a broadbased mutual fund or, preferably, an index fund. These issues will be highlighted in later chapters. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=727))

- Based on the foregoing analysis, you would expect dollar cost averaging to also perform well over longer investment periods. It doesn’t. Suppose you had started with a constant share purchase strategy and dollar cost averaging, each with $1 in January 1926,4 and continued monthly until 1991. (This involves 792 monthly investments, so I’ll spare you the table.) The CS strategy (a share a month) would have achieved an annualized rate of return of 11.24% over the period, whereas the DCA strategy ($1 a month) would have yielded only an 11.03% rate of return. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=735))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Worse than that, it wouldn’t have made much sense to dollar cost average with the same investment amount (be it $1, $100, or any fixed amount) over this entire period. Although the amount contributed each month under CS would have grown over time as the level of the market grew, you always would (with DCA) be investing a single dollar (or some other fixed amount) each month. But, as we are well aware, a 1991 dollar just isn’t the same as a 1926 dollar (or even a 1981 dollar for that matter). Due to inflation, today’s dollar is only worth one-eighth of its earlier value. So it makes sense, then, to at least take the “fixed amount” invested each month in a DCA plan and adjust it upward for inflation every now and then. Had this been done gradually over the 66 ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=740))

- years, the result of using inflation-adjusted5 dollar cost averaging would have been an annualized rate of return of 11.09%—a little bit higher than before but still under the CS base case of 11.24%. Let’s examine why DCA failed. Even with adjusting for inflation, there is still a problem over the long term because the stock market grows much faster than inflation over time. As mentioned previously, $1 of January 1926 market value grew to $533.64 worth of stock market value by 1991. The inflation-adjusted DCA strategy, which starts with a $1 investment buying a “full share” of the market in 1926, is investing only $8, or under 0.02 “shares” of the market by 1991. Our investment in the market is now less than one-fiftieth as large as it was in 1926. Because our investment amount so radically lags behind market growth, our exposure to market risk is not very well balanced over time. In relative terms, we would have poured a lot of money into the 1920-1930 market and very little real investment in the market of the 1980s (a much… ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=745))

- The dollar cost averaging strategy doesn’t “grow” with the market; this presents both logical and performance problems, as discussed above. The CS strategy, starting with $1 and increasing with the market value, yields a final 1991 portfolio value of $422,106, much more than either version of dollar cost averaging discussed so far.6 But if the so-called fixed amount of the dollar cost averaging investment had been increased by some steady amount over the 66 years, it could have resulted in a 1991 portfolio with roughly this larger value. That is, we could have made the amount invested in a DCA strategy steadily grow enough to keep up with the long-term growth in the level of the market. We can call this a growth-equalized variation of the strategy. It works out that, had you increased the original $1 fixed amount each month by 0.64% (a 7.96% annualized growth rate), you would have ended up with a $422,238 portfolio value using this growth-equalized dollar cost averaging strategy, about the same magnitude as the CS portfolio. Your DCA investment would have gradually kept pace with the market—at least enough to compare the results with the CS strategy. The rate of return on DCA would have jumped to 11.46%, higher than the 11.24% rate of return from the CS strategy, and higher still than the two less-sensible versions of dollar cost averaging. Interestingly enough, you wouldn’t have needed nearly as much money to invest with growth-equalized dollar cost averaging as with the CS strategy. Whereas the monthly requirement with CS would have bounced up and down (mostly up) with the level of the market to finish at $534/month by 1991, the growing (at 0.64% monthly7) DCA requirement would have smoothly increased to $155.44/month by 1991. The main lesson here is that the investment formula must somehow attempt to keep up with the phenomenal… ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=756))

- Dollar cost averaging is a simple and effective strategy for accumulating investment wealth over time. It knows nothing about whether the market is high or low; it simply works to purchase more shares when the price is lower and fewer shares when it is higher. Therefore, it can’t help but reduce the average price of the purchased shares, thus often enhancing the investment rate of return. A good investment vehicle must be utilized, and market growth should be taken into account in determining how much to invest over time. Dollar cost averaging is a “Buy low, buy less high” strategy, as there are no rules for selling. Although we would like to “sell high,” no one knows when these highs occur until it is too late. Without guidelines about when to sell, there is always the danger of indiscriminate selling that defeats the motive of accumulation of shares. If that selling takes place during market downturns, as it so frequently does, the results on investment returns can be disastrous. Even though no rule can tell you… ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=775))

- The investment vehicle you choose is far more important to your results than the mechanical rules you follow to invest in it. To that end, it is best to use value averaging with very diversified investments, such as a broad-based mutual fund or, preferably, an index fund.

- As discussed in the previous chapter, the fixed-amount rules just don’t make any sense over a long investment period, due to inflation and to extensive growth in the level of value of the stock market. With dollar cost averaging, the problem was simply that the fixed amount invested buys less and less of the market over time, so that the monthly additions ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=921))

- eventually become insignificant. The problem with so-called pure or fixed value averaging is more complex. With a CS strategy, where your investment grows with the market, both your incremental investment (new money) and the value of your previous holdings (old money) are “keeping up,” or moving with the market. With a fixed DCA strategy, your $1 incremental investment (new money) becomes insignificant, but at least the value of previously purchased shares (old money) keeps up with the market, as you never sell any of them. But with a fixed value averaging strategy, both the investment increment and the value, which is on a predetermined linear path, will become insignificant over time. Because “old” shares are not left alone (but are subject to being sold under the VA strategy), neither the old nor new money ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=924))

- keeps up with the market with VA. For example, the monthly $1 increase in value results in a portfolio value of only $792 after 66 years. The CS portfolio weighed in at over $422,000 at the same time. Admittedly, much more money was poured into the richer CS strategy, and with value averaging you would actually have taken out substantially more money than you put in.6 Still, you can see that the fixed, linear, “pure” VA strategy totally loses touch with the reality of sizable increases compounded over time in the market, when viewed in the long run. The $1-a-month increase in value is meaningful at first but becomes insignificant rather quickly. In fact, as market levels rise over time, VA actually acts to consistently move you out of the market, as opposed to accumulating ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L03XGO&location=929))

By focusing on a predetermined value goal that increases over time, you take the dollar cost averaging philosophy of “buy more cheap shares” a step further.

- generally higher with value averaging, and there is not much downside return risk relative to dollar cost averaging. The features of value averaging make it more flexible but also more complicated than dollar cost averaging. With any of these strategies—but with value averaging in particular—you must be particularly sensitive to keeping pace with long-term market growth to maintain a reasonable market exposure. In the next few chapters, some complications of the value averaging strategies (and of dollar cost averaging) will be discussed, along with an analysis of some recommended ways to use the strategies effectively.
