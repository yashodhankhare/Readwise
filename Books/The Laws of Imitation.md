## Highlights
- A born student of human nature, M. Tarde was from the first interested in that oldest of philosophical problems, the explanation of motive. He early perceived not only that motive may be resolved into terms of belief and desire, but v? also that it may be measured.

- But motives, and those impersonal forces that are not motives, work out results in an orderly fashion, by definite modes, which are the chief subject-matter of scientific study, and to the explanation of modes of activity M. Tarde was to make noteworthy contributions. Among the phenomena that early arrested his attention was imitation. From his office of magistrate he observed the large part that imitation plays in criminal conduct. Does it play a smaller part in normal conduct? Very rapidly M. Tarde's ardent mind ranged over the field of history, followed the spread of Western civilisation, and reviewed the development of language, the evolution of art, of law, and of institutions. The evidence was overwhelming that in all the affairs of men, whether of good or of evil ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=37))

- The evidence was overwhelming that in all the affairs of men, whether of good or of evil report, imitation is an ever-present factor; and to a philosophical mind the implication was obvious, that there must be psychological or sociological laws of imitation, worthy of most thorough study.

- With such notions M. Tarde had, and could have, no sympathy. He felt that if the study of society was to be erected into a science, a beginning must be made, not by demonstrating the logical and rightful place of sociology in the sisterhood of sciences, and not by exploiting the analogy of institutions to organic life, but rather by thoroughly examining the nature and combinations of some distinctively social phenomenon. The fact—the relationship or activity—if such there be, in virtue of which society is itself, a differentiated thing, and not merely a part of something else, that fact the sociologist should understand through and through, and in all its bearings, and should make it the corner-stone of his system. That elemental social fact M. Tarde believed he had discovered in the phenomenon of imitation. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=49))

- The laws of such a science, as I understand it, apply to every society, past, present, or future, just as the laws of general physiology apply to every species, living, extinct, or conceivable. The simplicity of such principles equals their generality, and I grant that it is much easier to lay them down and even to prove them, than to follow them through the labyrinth of their particular applications. Their formulation is nevertheless necessary. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=113))

- There are two ways of imitating, as a matter of fact, namely, to act exactly like one's model, or to do exactly the contrary. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=214))

- Socially, everything is either invention or imitation. And invention bears the same relation to imitatio^n as a mountain to a river. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=454))

- If we consider the science of society from this point of view, we shall at once see that human sociology is related to animal sociologies, as a species to its genus, so to speak. That it is an extraordinary and infinitely superior species, I admit, but it is allied to the others, nevertheless. M. Espinas expressly states in his admirable work on Societes ani-males, a work which was written long before the first edition of this book, that the labours of ants may be very well explained on the principle " of individual initiative followed by imitation" This initiative is always an innovation or invention that is equal to one of our own in boldness of spirit. To conceive the idea of constructing an arch, or a tunnel, at an appropriate point, an ant must be endowed with an innovating instinct equal to, or surpassing, that of our canal-digging or mountain-tunnelling engineers. Parenthetically it follows that imitation by masses of ants of such novel initiatives strikingly belies the spirit of mutual ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=460))

- But let us leave this question and confine ourselves to the statement that both animal and human societies may be explained from this point of view. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=473))

- In the second place, and this is the special thesis of this chapter, the subject of social science is seen, from this standpoint, to present a remarkable analogy to the other domains of general science, and, in this way, to become re-embodied, so to speak, in the rest of the universe, where it had before this the air of an outsider. In every field of study, affirmations pure and simple enormously outnumber explanations. And, in all cases, the first data are simply affirmed; they are the extraordinary and accidental facts, the premises and sources from which proceeds all that ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=475))

- which is subsequently explained. The astronomer states that certain nebulae, certain celestial 1 Among the higher species of ants, according to M. Espinas, " the individual develops an astonishing initiative" [Des Societes animates, p. 223; Alfred Espinas, Paris, 1877. The italics are M. Tarde's.— Tr.]. How do the labours and migrations of ant-swarms begin? Is it through a common, instinctive, and spontaneous impulse which starts from all the associates at the same time and under the pressure of out'ward circumstances which are experienced simultaneously by all ? On the contrary, a single ant begins by leaving the others and undertaking the work; then it strikes its neighbours with its antennae to summon their aid. and the contagion of imitation does the rest.

- Knowledge of causes is sometimes sufficient for foresight; but knowledge of resemblances always allows of enumeration and measurement, and science depends primarily upon number and measure. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=501))

- But, as a matter of fact, the mind does not fully understand nor clearly recognise the relation of cause and effect, except in as much as the effect resembles or repeats the cause, as, for example, when a sound wave produces another sound wave, or a cell, another cell.

- All repetition, social, vital, or physical, i. e., imitative, hereditary, or vibratory repetition (to consider only the most salient and typical forms of universal repetition), springs from some innovation, just as every light radiates from some central point, and thus throughout science the normal appears to originate from the accidental.

- heredity in organic life or to that of vibration among inorganic bodies. If this is so, it ought to be admitted, in consequence, that a human invention, by which a new kind of imitation is started or a new series opened,—the invention of gunpowder, for example, 1 or windmills, or the Morse telegraph,—stands in the same relation to social science as the birth of a new vegetal or mineral species (or, on the hypothesis of a gradual evolution, of each of the slow modifications to which the new species is due), to biology, or as the appearance of a new mode of motion comparable with ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=596))

- 3. All resemblances of social origin in society are the direct or indirect fruit of the various forms of imitation, — custom-imitation or fashion-imitation, sympathy-imitation or obedience-imitation, precept-imitation or education-imitation; na'ive imitation, deliberate imitation, etc. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F0UM8G4&location=647))
