## Highlights
- The American Heritage Dictionary defines temperament as “the manner of thinking, behaving, or reacting characteristic of a particular person.”4 In the world of investing, temperament manifests itself in whether you are ruled by emotions when you make decisions, causing you, for ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=180))
- example, to buy and then freak out and sell before you should. Whether you take on too much risk. Whether you’re frenetically moving into and out of stocks without ever having a clue as to what the business behind them actually does. Whether you let yourself get rattled by market movements to a paralyzing point, or whether you look at declining prices ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=182))
- and see opportunities. Buffett himself has talked about the importance of temperament, saying, “The most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. . . . You need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd.”5 He’s also said, “Success in investing doesn’t correlate ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=185))
- with IQ once you’re above the level of 125. Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.”6 ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=189))
- “We have five core feminine values. First, risk awareness: we will not invest in things we don’t understand. Second, profit with principles—we like a wider definition so it is not just economic profit, but a positive social and environmental impact. Third, emotional capital. When we invest, we do an ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=282))
- emotional due diligence—or check on the company—we look at the people, at whether the corporate culture is an asset or a liability. Fourth, straight talking. We believe the language of finance should be accessible, and not part of the alienating nature of banking culture. Fifth, independence. We would like to see women ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=284))
- increasingly financially independent, because with that comes the greatest freedom to be who you want to be, but also unbiased advice.” ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=287))
- Put simply, men think they know more than they do. Women are more willing to admit that they know what they don’t know. They’re more willing to own up to the fact that they don’t know everything. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=345))

- The ability to be calm and not make rash decisions in the face of such chaos is an incredibly important characteristic of successful investors over the long term. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=385))

- “These findings show that past performance is a better indicator of future performance for female managed funds than for male managed funds.”9 ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=425))
- Women research their investment decisions more thoroughly than men do, and second, they are less likely to bend to peer pressure. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=450))

- The report points to a 2002 study in the International Journal of Bank Marketing that showed that women dig deeper, analyze more information and details, and ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=451))

- are more likely to consider all information relating to a possible investment, even if it contradicts their initial research. In short, they want to know as much as they can and they take the time to learn it. Men, on the other hand, tend to take shortcuts with information, looking at the broadest factors and skipping data that goes against their initial thoughts.

- In other words, men keep it simple and move ahead; women like to get into the nitty-gritty and take their time. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=454))

- The next finding is even more fascinating. A 2008 University of California, Santa Barbara, study found that when men are being observed and judged by other men they consider of equal status (or, their peers), they tend to make riskier decisions than necessary in times of strife or loss, in an attempt to assert dominance. Worse still, even when the outcome would have been exactly the same had less risk been taken, the guys still chose the riskier path. Women didn’t have this same ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=456))

- reaction; they chose the same path regardless of who was observing them. They seem better able to avoid posturing and make decisions based on the factors at hand, versus trying to one-up a perceived competitor. Thinking about this peer pressure effect in the context of the financial crisis, where trading floors and boardrooms were filled with men trying to outdo one another, is fascinating, and also troubling. It just goes to show that peer pressure isn’t just an issue for thirteen-year-old girls battling it out on the mean streets of the ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=460))

- The other hormone in play here, cortisol, rises in stressful situations. Thus the scientists believed it would jump when traders started losing money. However, that’s not what they found, exactly. Cortisol levels did rise, but it wasn’t related to traders losing money. Instead, rises in cortisol showed a correlation with rises in market volatility.

- Graham’s investing philosophy was actually built on pessimism, something that Buffett moved slowly away from over the years. Dubbed “cigar butt” investing, the idea was to find the cheapest stock possible (say, a company selling for below what all of its assets would fetch in the open market), and buy ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=1049))

- Paradigm Capital Management Candace King Weir said of the challenge of staying true to yourself, “you have to have a certain set courage of your own convictions, because often you can be wrong for weeks or months. It’s not that you really were wrong, but you appear to be wrong. . . . So you do have to have the courage of your convictions, I think to be good. You really have to be grounded. “I think we had a pretty fabulous year in ’09, just because we stuck to our knitting when other people were just ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=1261))

We’d just come in and we’d talk to our companies and if we thought that things were really outrageously out of whack, then we would buy a little more, but fundamentally we are very disciplined. I think discipline is really critical, too. You do have to show up every day, no matter the days you hate it. You say, ‘I can’t bear it.’ You can’t bear to lose any more money.

- However, Buffett’s hand was forced on the stock split issue in the mid-1990s. Investment houses, wise to the fact that more people wanted to own a piece of Berkshire Hathaway than could afford one, planned to buy shares of Berkshire and divvy them up, selling them as smaller units to the public, and charging fat fees for the privilege. To avoid what he saw as an expensive and unfair way to profit from Berkshire’s success at the expense of small investors, Buffett created a second class of Berkshire shares in 1996, the “B” shares, which were valued at 1/30 of an “A” share and had voting rights of 1/200 of an “A” share. The Berkshire “B” shares, however, were actually split 50-to-1 in early 2010, to help shareholders of Burlington Northern, which Berkshire announced it intended to purchase in full at the end of 2009. Burlington shareholders could choose either cash or Berkshire stock, so by making the share price lower for them, Buffett made it easier for them to choose the stock versus the cash (and avoid any nasty tax... implications). This move also opened the door for Berkshire to replace Burlington Northern in the S&P 500 (can you believe it wasn’t already in there?).

- despite the fact that Buffett ultimately made money on US Airways, he still recognizes it as a mistake. His outcome might not have been bad, but his thinking and his decision-making process were. He is able, then, to separate the “outcome” from the “decision.” Many investors struggle with this, believing, for example, that their worst-performing ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004MMEILO&location=1432))
