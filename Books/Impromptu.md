## Highlights
- It is, all said, a technology that deftly leverages some of our most significant technologies from the last thirty years—including the internet, mobile, cloud computing, and data analytics—to put the protean power of always-on AI into the hands of hundreds of millions of people. Sounds a little bit like the start of a new world, doesn’t it? ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=110))

- month later, at the end of November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a “conversational agent,” aka chatbot, a modified version of GPT-3.5 that they had fine-tuned through a process called Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) to enable more flowing, human-like conversations with its human users. Five days later, ChatGPT had more than a million registered users. In late January 2023, Microsoft1—which had invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019—announced that it would be investing $10 billion more in the company. It soon unveiled a new version of its search engine Bing, with a variation of ChatGPT built into it. By the start of February 2023, OpenAI said ChatGPT had one ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=152))

- hundred million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer internet app ever. Along with that torrent of user interest, there were news stories of the new Bing chatbot functioning in sporadically unusual ways that were very different from how ChatGPT had generally been engaging with users—including showing “anger,” hurling insults, boasting on its hacking abilities and capacity for revenge, and basically acting as if it were auditioning for a future episode of Real Housewives: Black Mirror Edition. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott suggested that such behavior was “clearly part of the learning process” as more people use GPT-like tools. These incidents do raise questions that will persist as LLMs evolve. I’ll address such issues in more detail later in the book, and try to put them in what I believe is the appropriate context. For now, I’ll just say, “See what I mean about things moving quickly?” ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=159))

- A gene doesn’t have conscious agency or self-conception in the way the word “selfish” suggests. But the phrase, the metaphor, helps us humans wrap our inevitably anthropocentric minds around how the gene functions. Similarly, GPT-4 doesn’t have the equivalent of a human mind. It’s still helpful to think in terms of its “perspective,” anthropomorphizing it a bit, because using language like “perspective” helps convey that GPT-4 does in fact operate in ways that are not entirely fixed, consistent, or predictable.

- Take ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-3.5, an immediate predecessor to GPT-4. Ask it for the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg Address, and it will probably get it wrong. That’s because LLMs don’t actually understand, in the way that humans understand, what the Gettysburg Address is, or what a sentence is, or even how counting works. So they can’t apply their “knowledge” of these things in a way that a human might. (“I’ll find the text of the Gettysburg Address, then count sentences until I get to the fifth one.”) Instead, an ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=205))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- LLM is always just making statistical predictions about what the next word in a given text string should be. From its training, though, ChatGPT has clearly come to associate the words “Gettysburg Address” with other words—specifically, the text of the speech. So when you ask ChatGPT for the fifth sentence of the Gettysburg Address, it will almost certainly give you a sentence from the Gettysburg Address, but probably not the fifth sentence. In fact, I bet it will be the ninth sentence. I assume this because, along with the speech’s first sentence, the ninth is frequently quoted in other texts. That means in ChatGPT’s training data, the ninth probably shows up more often than other sentences from the speech (except the very famous first). This prevalence is what causes ChatGPT to reach for it when you ask it to supply the fifth sentence.3 ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=208))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Of course the key word here remains seems. GPT-4 is no more conscious than its predecessors; it’s just better at making predictions. Again, I want to make the point that GPT-4’s often-remarkable simulations of cognitive proficiency are just that: simulations. GPT-4 is not a conscious, self-aware, sentient AI entity, a la Forbidden Planet’s Robby the Robot or Star Trek’s Data. And yet I also want to again make the point that—whoa, even GPT-4’s ability to simulate such ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=244))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- a contextually-aware human-like consciousness is a pretty big deal. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=249))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But since ChatGPT exists as a merely approximate picture of the web, Chiang argues, it is (in addition to being inherently fact-challenged) quite limited as a creative force. Instead of creating something truly new, it can only “repackage information that’s already available.” ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=262))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- First, I’d argue that repackaging available information actually describes an enormous share of human innovation, artistic or otherwise. More importantly, though, LLMs actually have and use fundamentally new powers of knowledge organization. While the web now contains an unfathomable amount of information, much of it is siloed into billions of individual pages. For example, think of questions like these: Who is the tallest NFL running back to win the MVP award? What cities with more than one million residents have had female mayors? Who was the oldest James Bond? The data to answer these questions is no doubt on the web already. There are sites that definitively list every NFL MVP winner. Others accurately compile NFL players’ physical stats. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=265))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But unless someone has already taken the trouble to compile and publish the exact information you’re looking for, it could be very time-consuming to find. Even if that information exists on a single website, like Wikipedia or NFL.com, it will likely be spread across multiple pages. Getting your answer will still chew up a lot of your time. In addition, imagine when your goal is to get a concise overview of some broader interest or theme, like those I suggested at the top of this chapter (researching supply chain management issues during COVID-19, or a travel itinerary that reflects specific interests). The takeaway: in your overall quest for authoritative information, GPT-4 helps you start somewhere much closer to the finish line than if you didn’t have it as a resource. More importantly, it possesses this capability because it is able to access and synthesize the web’s information in a significantly different way from existing information resources like Wikipedia ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=273))

- or traditional search engines. Essentially, GPT-4 arranges vast, unstructured arrays of human knowledge and expression into a more connected and interoperable network, thus amplifying humanity’s ability to compound its collective ideas and impact.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- GPT-4 is not that, at least not yet. For now, it is neither all-knowing nor infallible. Instead, it is, in its own words, a “tool” that requires human “caution, curiosity, and responsibility” to operate most productively. I think this is the correct perspective. If you simply let GPT-4 ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=306))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- do all the work, with no human oversight or engagement, it’s a less powerful tool. It’s still a very human tool, of course, because human texts are the basis for its generations. But when human users treat GPT-4 as a co-pilot or a collaborative partner, it becomes far more powerful. You compound GPT-4’s computational generativity, efficiency, synthetic powers, and capacity to scale with human creativity, human judgment, and human guidance. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=309))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This doesn’t eliminate the possibility of misuse. But, in situating human beings at the center of the new world that GPT-4 makes possible, we get what I believe to be the soundest formula for producing the best potential overall outcomes. In this approach, GPT-4 doesn’t replace human labor and human agency, but rather amplifies human abilities and human flourishing. Of course, this way of thinking isn’t a given. It’s a choice. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=313))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When people make the choice to see GPT-4 this way, I call it an “AHA!” moment, to underscore the “Amplifying Human Abilities” perspective at the heart of that choice. I’m writing this travelog both to encourage people to embrace this choice and also as an invitation to explore the different ways this choice might play out. What are the ways we can use GPT-4 to make progress in the world? How does it fit into humanity’s age-old quest to make life more meaningful and prosperous through technological innovation? To educate ourselves more effectively, ensure justice for everyone, and increase our opportunities for self-determination and self-expression?

- But as Mintz wrote: [If ChatGPT] can do a job as well as a person, then humans shouldn’t duplicate those abilities; they must surpass them. The next task for higher education, then, is to prepare graduates to make the most effective use of the new tools and to rise above and go beyond their limitations. That means pedagogies that emphasize active and experiential learning, that show students how to take advantage of these new technologies, and that produce graduates who can do those things that the tools can’t. In peering ahead to determine which skills would most likely be prized in this onrushing future, Mintz referred to the work of Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a funny and rambunctious young organizational psychologist whose books have titles such as Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? Mintz agreed with Chamorro-Premuzic that humans could thrive alongside AI by: (1) specializing ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=367))

- The question, then, is whether LLMs differ from previous technologies in that they can unlock new leverage for teachers and schools to deliver materially better results for tens of millions of public school students. Professor Mintz and Ms. Shields think the answer is yes—and I would not bet against their enthusiastic example. They know they don’t currently represent the majority of their profession; they hear their colleagues’ fears. Nonetheless, they are aiming to prove that LLMs will transformatively improve the work experience of being a teacher. Ms. Shields, for instance, told the Times that ChatGPT could address the bane of English teachers everywhere: grading papers. Ms. Shields: “I don’t know if you are aware of this, but . . . it [ChatGPT] can evaluate writing. So one ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=549))

Just for grins I said, ‘Evaluate this essay for grammatical and sentence structure.’ And it did really well.” NYT interviewer: “Wow.” Ms. Shields: “And it said here’s—and it gave him [the student] the strengths. It said, ‘Here’s what you’re doing well.’ And then it said, ‘Here are some places to work on.’ And it even said stuff like, ‘Your transitions aren’t very smooth, and your introduction is lacking, and there’s no thesis in this whole essay.’ I mean, that’s one-on-one feedback.” NYT interviewer: “Yeah.” Ms. Shields: “It would take me about a week to get through—I have eighty essays to do at a time. So about a week later, I get to give them [the students] feedback. But this is going to give them instant feedback . . . I’ll say, ‘Have this evaluate your essay for ideas and content, or for sentence structure, or for organization, and then go ahead ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=556))

- Reid: GPT-4, can you write the next 300 words from your perspective as a large language model and describe how you could extend the Bridge/NewGlobe tablets into a tool to help tens of millions of students throughout Africa and Asia? GPT-4: As a large language model, I can help by enhancing the quality, personalization, and scalability of their learning content. Here is how I would do it: First, I would use natural language processing and computer vision to analyze the existing lesson scripts, test scores, teacher feedback, and student performance data from Bridge/NewGlobe schools. I would identify the key learning objectives, concepts, skills, and assessments for each grade level and subject, as well as the common misconceptions, gaps, and difficulties that students face. I would also detect the linguistic, cultural, and contextual variations that affect the relevance and appropriateness of the content for different regions and settings. Second, I would use natural language generation and computer graphics to create new and improved lesson scripts, activities, exercises, and multimedia resources that are aligned with the learning objectives ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=637))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and adapted to the local needs and preferences of the students and teachers. I would use techniques such as question generation, answer extraction, feedback provision, and adaptive sequencing to make the content more interactive, responsive, and personalized. Third, I would use natural language understanding and speech recognition to monitor and support the delivery and use of the content by the teachers and students. I would also use techniques such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and machine translation to enable the users to communicate with the content and with each other in their preferred languages and modes.

- As the New York Times reported in February: “Artists are afraid of posting new art,” the computer science professor Ben Zhao said. Putting art online is how many artists advertise their services but now they have a “fear of feeding this monster that becomes more and more like them,” Professor Zhao said. “It shuts down their business model.” This strikes me as a reasonable concern, and Professor Zhao’s solution—Glaze, a tool for artists to digitally “mask” their images—seems a reasonable, and creative, response. Glaze changes an image at a pixel level that the human eye can’t perceive, but that a ‘bot “understands” as an entirely different style of image: . . . that Stable Diffusion would associate with, for example, the splattered paint blobs of Jackson Pollock. . . . When [artist Karla] Ortiz posted her Glazed work online, an image generator trained ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=947))

- So while most of us may think of journalism as a product, it’s ultimately a process—iterative and self-correcting. Ideally, tomorrow’s stories refine, clarify, and expand on today’s. Accuracy is a persistent defining value, but so is speed. That’s a major reason I believe GPT-4 and other AI tools will have such an outsized, net-positive impact on journalism: they’ll help news organizations gather, produce, and distribute the news faster than ever before. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1201))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- That’s because interacting with GPT-4 is not like traditional web searching. Instead, it’s better evoked by a term that was popular back in the early days of Web 1.0: web surfing. A dialogue develops. A flow state takes over. You ask GPT-4 a question and it responds right away with highly relevant information, not just a series of links. So then you immediately think of more questions and ask those. Thus the process of discovery that can often feel halting and frustrating using traditional search methods— “Oh, I guess that link isn’t really about AI and journalism at all . . .”—feels more like steady progress toward greater awareness and understanding. This, I believe, is a huge part of what’s fueling the immense popularity of GPT-4’s sibling, ChatGPT. The experience itself is so responsive and self-propelling that a kind of intellectual escalation kicks in: asking one question makes you want to ask ten. This phenomenon, I also realized, was a big part of the story I should tell in this chapter. Initially, I had assumed that I would highlight automated journalism, describing how news organizations are already using databases and template-driven ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1244))

- AI systems to produce thousands of stories about corporate earnings reports, weather forecasts, sports events, and more. But while automated journalism does represent a strategic opportunity for news organizations, conversing with GPT-4 took me down a different path. The story I found most compelling in terms of its potential impact on the journalism industry is how GPT-4 itself can increase consumers’ engagement. People are going to like news more when they have more control over how it’s delivered—and, as a result, I suspect they’ll want more of it.

- When I asked GPT-4 how this personalization would work, here’s what it replied: Reid: To make news media websites more personalized, what data will these websites use to analyze readers’ behavior and preferences? GPT-4: News media websites will use data such as the reader’s location, the type of device they are using, their browsing history, and the articles they have previously read or interacted with. They can also analyze which articles the reader has shared on social media, how long they spend on the website, and which sections they visit most frequently. Additionally, data on the reader’s age, gender, and interests can be used to personalize content. This data can be obtained through cookies, surveys, and user accounts, among other methods. By analyzing this data, news media websites can tailor their content to the reader’s preferences and interests, providing a more personalized experience. In other words, the traditional approach. Not too innovative. Meanwhile, as I noted above, the “conversational chat” approach that GPT-4 and especially its sibling ChatGPT were themselves using offered its ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1264))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- own powerful—but significantly different—version of personalization. In contrast to how traditional web-based personalization works, with websites perpetually surveilling users over time, GPT-4 and ChatGPT simply offer highly responsive information to your queries and prompts in real-time. This is both a somewhat obvious observation about how these LLMs operate, but also (as yet) an under-appreciated one. Indeed, it’s not just their human-like fluency and seeming expertise on so many subjects that makes them so popular. Unlike chatbots designed to promote a product or politician, GPT-4 and ChatGPT are not only able but also incredibly willing to focus on whatever you want to talk about.4 This simple dynamic creates a highly personalized user experience. As an exchange with GPT-4 progresses, you are continuously fine-tuning it to your specific preferences in that moment. While this high degree of personalization informs whatever you’re using GPT-4 for, I believe it has special salience for the news media industry.

By enabling this functionality on their websites, news organizations can capitalize on the same one-question-begets-ten-questions dynamic driving ChatGPT’s growth. In addition, this functionality would also create new opportunities for trust, which of course is a bilateral phenomenon. While I personally trust many news organizations generally, I also think most news organizations have not done nearly as much as they could do to engage their users more productively—to treat them more like active participants rather than passive consumers. But giving users more power to define their own news consumption pathways would be one genuinely substantive way to do that.

And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” To date, the tendency of LLMs like Bing Chat and ChatGPT to produce inadvertent misinformation in their own faulty attempts to write statistically plausible “truth” has overshadowed their potential use as disinformation fire hoses that bad actors could use to, ahem, muddy the waters of public discourse. Obviously, that potential is there, waiting patiently. When bad actors inevitably put these tools to such ends, I’m sure we’ll see calls for new regulation tailored specifically to AI-generated disinformation.

- social media that has helped make disinformation so spreadable. It’s worth remembering that things didn’t start out this way. In many of its earliest incarnations, social media actually helped bring transparency and veracity to the online world. For example, when my co-founders and I launched LinkedIn twenty years ago, we were motivated largely by the fact that the divisions between “cyberspace” and “the real world” were rapidly collapsing. Instead of existing as a place that people “went to” under the cover of pseudonymous screen names, the internet had evolved into a place that people were using to facilitate their lives. They went there to buy things, and stay in touch with their families, and make plans with their real-world friends. In such a milieu, my co-founders and I realized, digital platforms built on real identity could be hugely beneficial to hundreds of millions of people. In LinkedIn’s case, of course, we focused on professional identity. To create trust on our platform, we positioned a user’s identity in networks of affiliation.

- The first is that AI tools capable of communicating in human-like ways are by no means inherently deceptive. It’s all about intention. A customer-service chatbot that clearly conveys its status as a non-human entity is in fact behaving in an extremely authentic manner. The second is that while AI tools can potentially cause confusion when used deceptively, they will also create great value when used transparently and straightforwardly.

- in the world begins to deploy chatbots as capable of answering your questions as GPT-4. Now, to extend this further—and to bring this line of thought back to social media—imagine having extended conversations with chatbot versions of MrBeast, Michelle Obama, Benjamin Franklin, Marge Simpson, the world’s best high school math tutor, an expert on B2B marketing, etc. I’m not saying this world is coming next month, or even next year. But I do think that LLM chatbots of this type will eventually join the ranks of books, podcasts, instructional videos, music albums, and other media formats that individuals use to syndicate their thoughts, values, personality, and creativity across time and space. Of course, this isn’t an endeavor without risk, at least as long as LLMs continue to produce hallucinations and other unintended consequences at not-insignificant rates. So I don’t expect someone of Michelle Obama’s stature to lead the charge. Instead, it will likely be people who are willing to take on some risk in return for a shot at pioneering a field where early adopters could reap outsized rewards. My guess is that most will emerge from the ranks of social media. In part, this is because a chatbot like this could help address a common social media challenge. To show you what I mean, let’s imagine a fictional YouTube creator I’ll call Codysseus. Codysseus is a twenty-five-year-old software developer who travels around North America in his van conversion, accompanied by his pet cat Clickbait. When Codysseus arrives at a new destination, he usually ends up staying in the most unique Airbnb he can find. When no rentals are available, he just stays in his van. Since remote computer work is not particularly cinematic, Codysseus also spends a fair amount of time exploring his latest habitat in search of material he can use in the weekly episodes he posts to YouTube. Sometimes he takes odd jobs in the hope of creating more fodder for his channel. Sometimes he gives seminars to the locals on how to approximate his digital nomad life. In the early days of his channel, Codysseus was vigilant about answering every viewer comment within twenty-four hours. He quickly learned that maintaining this high level of responsiveness turned one-time viewers into repeat viewers, and repeat viewers into subscribers. But now that he has 150,000 subscribers and a new video can get upwards of 1000 comments, he has to leave more and more questions unanswered. Not surprisingly, given his work as a software developer, Codysseus starts thinking about how AI could help him out. Initially, his focus is on how he might automate replies to the comments his viewers leave him on YouTube. At a certain point, however, he realizes that creating a full-blown chatbot of himself would be even more compelling. It would give his fans an ongoing, in-depth way to interact with him. It might become a source of real insights about what his fans like best about his content and his persona. It could even… ([Location 1519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1519))

- would a YouTube creator named Codysseus, with a catalog of transcripts from more than a hundred fifteen-minute episodes, plus 20,000+ words of blog archives, plus 2000+ replies to viewer comments, plus 500+ Reddit posts be able to use this data to effectively create a fine-tuned version of GPT-4 that approximates his speech patterns, sensibilities and values, sense of humor, guiding interests and aspirations, and generally conveys his personality? GPT-4: Possible answer: Yes, a YouTube creator named Codysseus would likely be able to use this data to effectively create a fine-tuned version of GPT-4 that approximates his speech patterns, sensibilities and values, sense of humor, guiding interests and aspirations, and generally conveys his personality. Assuming that GPT-4 is publicly accessible, affordable, and scalable, and that it has significantly improved on GPT-3’s capabilities, Codysseus could leverage the large and diverse corpus of his own written and spoken content to train a custom model that captures his unique voice and style. He could also use additional data sources, such as feedback from his audience, social media interactions, and relevant topics and trends, to further refine and update his model. By fine-tuning GPT-4 on his own data, Codysseus could potentially generate new content that is consistent, coherent, and creative, and that reflects his personality and preferences. He could also use his model to interact with his ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1547))

- fans, answer questions, and provide commentary on various issues. However, Codysseus would also need to be careful and ethical in using his model, and ensure that he discloses and acknowledges the use of GPT-4 to his viewers and followers. He would also need to monitor and evaluate his model’s outputs, and correct any errors, biases, or inaccuracies that might arise. Moreover, he would need to respect the intellectual property and privacy rights of others, and avoid plagiarizing or misrepresenting any sources or information. Finally, he would need to maintain his own authenticity and integrity, and not rely solely on his model to express himself or engage with his community. In short, it’s quite possible that someone like Codysseus could do this already. It would take him some time and effort to arrange all his source data—the YouTube transcripts, blog posts, etc.—into the format that the… ([Location 1558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1558))

- As usual, GPT-4 emphasizes the same themes I’ve been emphasizing throughout this travelog: the value of transparency, ongoing human oversight, and complementarity. If Codysseus were open about his chatbot usage, and presented this digital entity transparently as an extension of himself (instead of trying to pass it off as the real him), his opportunities would increase accordingly. He might, for example, ultimately create multiple fine-tuned models of himself. One might focus primarily on coding instruction. Another might offer advice specifically on digital nomadism. Perhaps he’d even create a chatbot—make that a catbot—to embody Clickbait. Some of these iterations might be available only to paying subscribers. Others might be underwritten by sponsors whose products and services the chatbot occasionally mentions. All would potentially increase the… ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=1567))

No one foresaw that it was about to turn cats into millionaires. No one was anticipating the rapid growth and mainstreaming of content genres like reaction videos, makeup videos, unboxing videos, ASMR videos, and so many others. Instead, thousands of innovative creators equipped with powerful new tools and capabilities simply started exploring their crazy ideas and passions—and sometimes magic happened.

Even if only a small fraction of the suggestions were useful, there’s still huge value there—and it’s not something you could do with Google. For all of these activities, humans will remain in the pilot’s chair, but AI can be a helpful co-pilot. Eventually, we won’t even comment on entrepreneurs who operate with AI—they will simply be entrepreneurs. There is an additional area GPT-4 didn’t mention where AI will be a big help to entrepreneurs: as a storytelling tool. Every entrepreneur needs to tell a compelling story about how their startup will produce a better future. The more real and concrete this possible future seems to potential investors, employees, buyers, and collaborators, the more likely the startup will be to attract the capital, people, customers, and partners it needs to succeed.

- Consider Wikipedia. Today, Wikipedia’s English version alone gets more than ten billion monthly page views from more than 850 million unique devices. Whatever amount of error it contains, I think it’s safe to say we’ve learned to live with it, and we now regularly depend on Wikipedia to help navigate and make sense of the world. How did this happen when, in Wikipedia’s early years, it was widely seen as its own kind of untrustworthy hallucination machine?

- This resonates with a core principle I champion in my books and podcasts and that I almost always apply to my investing, political, and philanthropic decisions: good distribution is far more important to a product’s success than good service—or even the product’s initial quality. Without distribution, few people will even have a chance to try what you made. As a free online resource, Wikipedia was much more accessible than any previous encyclopedia, including earlier digital ones like Microsoft Encarta. Web distribution also freed Wikipedia from printing and shipping costs, which meant it could cover so many topics that it was soon making print publications like Encyclopedia Britannica look decidedly, well, non-encyclopedic—skimpy, even. Finally, digital distribution meant that Wikipedia could publish edits and updates instantly and incessantly, transforming inaccuracy into a fairly correctable problem. Of course, when a widely distributed product has any issues with content quality, users expose them, very quickly. This is why a great distribution strategy is also a great product-development strategy. As I like to say, if you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. The goal is to start getting user feedback as soon as possible. From the start, lots of people clearly found Wikipedia’s crowd-sourced “good enough knowledge” useful enough to keep using. In turn, high usage led to more usefulness, as more feedback made Wikipedia better. Today, as one of the top ten most-visited websites in the U.S., the amount of accurate information Wikipedia distributes likely exceeds that of any news organization, encyclopedia, research organization, or other information publisher that might legitimately claim a… ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=2323))

- answer a much wider range of questions than Wikipedia or any other source; I believe they can answer these questions faster; and I believe they can do so through an intuitive interface that makes information retrieval highly accessible to a wide range of users. What does this all add up to? Because LLMs offer such advantages in breadth, efficiency, and accessibility, I believe they’ve already achieved the status of “good enough knowledge,” despite their hallucinations. More importantly, I’m very confident that from here, things are chiefly going to get better. So when we hear urgent calls to regulate LLMs like we regulate many other industries, we should remember that today’s car and drug regulations did not arise fully fledged. They were informed by years of actual usage, and… ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BYG9V1RN&location=2341))

- think we have enough information and context yet to determine what regulations we do need. In the meantime, it’s vital to get a more quantitative and systematic handle on the problems and challenges LLMs will present. That’s easier said than done, in part because the developers who have the best data on LLM error rates have so far released little of it. But they have released some, and the picture is actually fairly encouraging. For example, in January 2022, OpenAI published a paper about a “sibling” model to ChatGPT, called InstructGPT, noting that fine-tuning involving human feedback significantly reduced the model’s toxic outputs and hallucinations.7 And, when problems do occur, companies are often well-incentivized to correct them.

- The paradox of the AI era is this: as today’s imperfect LLMs improve, requiring less and less from us, we will need to demand more from ourselves. We must always insist on situating GPT-4 and its successors as our collaborative partners, not our replacements. We must continue to figure out how to keep human creativity, human judgment, and human values at the center of the processes we devise to work with these new AI tools, even as they themselves grow more and more capable. If that sounds daunting, remember the upside: while tools like GPT-4 can certainly enable complacency, they can also enable extraordinary results.
