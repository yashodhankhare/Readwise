## Highlights
- Dhandho is thus best described as endeavors that create wealth while taking virtually no risk. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=128))

- A final note on the Marwaris and their ingrained Dhandho ways. Recently, I had dinner with a good Marwari friend of mine, and I asked him how the stereotypical Marwari approaches investing capital in a venture?

- He said, quite nonchalantly, that Marwari businesspeople, even with only a fifth-grade education, simply expect all their invested capital to be returned in the form of dividends in no more than three years. They expect that, after having gotten their money back, their principal investment continues to be worth at least what they invested in it. They expect these to be ultra low-risk bets. Now, folks, this is really good stuff—they don’t teach this at the Harvard Business School. If you simply used this ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=527))

Starting with very little capital, after a few decades you’ll be very wealthy.   Enough said. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=531))

- Dhandho 102: Invest in Simple Businesses The advantages of buying a fraction of an existing business are pretty clear, but before we buy, we must know its intrinsic value. How else would we know if it’s a good deal at a given price? What is the intrinsic value of a business? Is there a general formula? How do we figure it ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=791))

- out? Every business has an intrinsic value, and it is determined by the same simple formula. John Burr Williams was the first to define it in his The Theory of Investment Value published in 1938.1 Per Williams, the intrinsic value of any business is determined by the cash inflows and outflows—discounted at an appropriate interest rate—that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the business. The definition is painfully simple. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=794))

- To illustrate let’s imagine that toward the end of 2006, a neighborhood gas station is put up for sale, and the owner offers it for $500,000. Further, let’s assume that the gas station can be sold for $400,000 after 10 years. Free cash flow—money that can be pulled out of the business—is expected to be $100,000 a year for the next 10 years.

- Are we better off buying the gas station or taking our virtually assured 10 percent return? I used a Texas Instruments BA-35 calculator to do these discounted cash flow (DCF) calculations. Alternately, you could use Excel. As Table 7.1 demonstrates, the gas station has an intrinsic value of about $775,000. We would be buying it for $500,000, so we’d be buying it for roughly two-thirds of its intrinsic… ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=802))

- We’re getting off track. The objective of this exercise is not to figure out whether to invest in BBBY stock—it is simply to demonstrate that while John Burr Williams’s definition of intrinsic value is painfully simple, calculating it for a given business may not be so simple.

- If we were to look at a business like Google, it starts getting very complicated. Google has undergone spectacular growth in revenues and cash flow over the past few years. If we extrapolate that into the future, the business appears to be trading at a big discount to its underlying intrinsic value.

- 5. Take a look at Value Investors Club (VIC; www.valueinvestorsclub.com). It is a wonderful web site started and managed by Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Capital. Greenblatt has perhaps the best audited record of any unleveraged investor on the planet over the past 20 years—a compounded annualized return of 40 percent. We delve more into Greenblatt and his Dhandho approach later in the book. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=998))

- Value Investors Club has about 250 members—each of whom had to get approved for membership by presenting a good investment idea. These members are required to post at least two ideas a year. The quality of these ideas is decent as they are peer rated. If a member presents shoddy ideas, he or she is likely to lose membership privileges. Every week the best idea (judged by VIC management) gets $5,000. The primary benefit of membership is the ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=1000))

- The Little Book That Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt. 3 I will presume that the reader of this book has already read Greenblatt’s book. His Magic Formula calls for all stocks to be held for exactly a year. Whether a stock declines or appreciates, once you buy a Magic Formula stock, per the algorithm, it cannot be sold for a year. Magic Formula stocks are, in general, deep value stocks. They are mostly stocks where the lion has already roared and the stock has plummeted. The Magic Formula works because most of the roaring, if not all, ends over the course of the year and ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=2272))

- rationality prevails, eventually leading to, on average, a significantly above-market annualized return. One year is a very good holding time frame, but if you understand the business well before buying it, I believe a longer time frame is fully warranted and justified. The Magic Formula suggests that you buy stocks that you know nothing about and hold for 12 months. It makes logical sense that you’d want to allow a longer holding period on businesses you actually understand well.
