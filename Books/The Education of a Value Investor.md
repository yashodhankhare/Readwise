## Highlights
- We like to think that we change our environment, but the truth is that it changes us. So we have to be extraordinarily careful to choose the right environment—to work with, and even socialize with, the right people. Ideally, we should stick close to people who are better than us so that we can become more like them. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=262))

- In an article entitled “Trauma Reveals the Roots of Resilience,” the psychologist Diana Fosha quotes a line from Ernest Hemingway: “The world breaks everyone and afterward some are strong at the broken places.” Why is it that some people are strengthened by their traumas and not broken by them?

- What I stumbled upon was this. Desperate to figure out how to lead a life that was more like his, I began constantly to ask myself one simple question: “What would Warren Buffett do if he were in my shoes?” ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=581))

- should simply have copied the fee structure of his pre-Berkshire investment partnerships. He charged no annual management fee, but took a quarter of the profits above a 6 percent hurdle. This is an extremely unusual structure, but it’s the best alignment I’ve ever seen between an investor and his shareholders. It truly embodies the principle of making money with them, not off them. Unless they do well, the fund manager earns nothing. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=664))

- Part of the problem was that it was so easy to get sucked into the vortex of the New York financial world, with its skewed values and seductions. I felt that my mind was in Omaha, and I believed that I could use the force of my intellect to rise above my environment. But I was wrong: as I gradually discovered, our ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=691))

Great investors like Warren Buffett (who left New York and returned to Omaha) and Sir John Templeton (who settled in the Bahamas) clearly grasped this idea, which took me much longer to learn.

One of these was an apartment on West 58th Street, where Monica Lewinsky was a neighbor. Another was a two-bedroom apartment on West 55th, where David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue, was my neighbor. I’d read that he, like me, had attention deficit disorder (ADD). Yet he’d still managed to build a successful company. I found this reassuring: having him in ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=697))

The performance was driven by the success of stocks like Duff & Phelps Credit Rating, which rose seven-fold.

While others got caught up in the tech bubble of the late 1990s, I didn’t get lured in at all, partly because I was in the orbit of cool-headed investors like Buffett, Ruane Cunniff, and Tweedy, Browne. Their common sense helped to protect me from tech fever. This proved once again that environment trumps intellect.

- successes. Born in 1964, Mohnish grew up in Mumbai, New Delhi, and Dubai and arrived in the United States as a penniless student in the 1980s. He went on to build an IT consulting and services business called TransTech, which he financed with $70,000 in credit card debt and about $30,000 from his 401k. TransTech’s revenues grew to $20 million and he ultimately sold the company for $6 million. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=902))

- but he gave me a deeper insight into the mechanism by which the low price itself would be a catalyst to turn the market around since the supply of tankers was drying up. In doing this, Mohnish exhibited what Howard Marks would later call “second-level thinking”—a grasp of nuance that is important but rare among investors.

- After Mohnish’s annual meeting, I returned home to New York, picked up a fountain pen, and wrote him a short note. Written in my semi-legible scrawl, it said something like: “Dear Mr. Pabrai, Thank you so much for having me as a guest at your partnership meeting. I learned a lot about life and investing, and I also met some great people. Warm regards, Guy Spier.” It was one simple note out of at least ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=931))

- a dozen letters that I sent that week. I had no agenda in writing it and expected nothing in return. I mailed it and then forgot about it. But Mohnish later told me that I was the only person who wrote to him after that meeting, and my note clearly stuck in his head. About six months later, he sent me an email to say that he was going to a meeting in Greenwich, Connecticut. Did I want to meet for dinner? I most certainly did. That meal with Mohnish altered the trajectory of my life—even more, perhaps, than my subsequent lunch with Warren Buffett.

- What I saw during that meal was a man completely at ease with himself. The person on the outside was the same as the person on the inside; he wasn’t pretending to be anything to anybody. So often in my life, I wasn’t aligned or at peace with myself. But in Mohnish’s presence, from the very start, I was myself. Misalignment is a dangerous thing, not just in relationships but in business and investing.

I quickly realized that Mohnish, like me, had been on a quest for worldly wisdom. But he had arrived at it from a different direction and with a very different mind. From Tony Robbins I had discovered the power of modeling the habits of successful people; Mohnish, who referred to this as “cloning,” sometimes jokes that he’s never had an original idea in… ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=957))

- He then went on to explain how crucial it is to adhere to values that you know to your core are right rather than being swayed by external forces such as peer pressure. “It’s very important always to live your life by an inner scorecard, not an outer scorecard,” he said. To illustrate this, he then asked us, “Would you prefer to be considered the best lover in the world and know privately that you’re the worst—or would you prefer to know privately that you’re the best lover in the world, but be considered the worst?” ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=1154))

- For Warren, the travails of this gifted investor clearly provided a powerful example of the perils of debt and the virtues of patience. “Charlie and I always knew we would become very wealthy,” he told us, “but we weren’t in a hurry.” After all, he said, “If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy—if you’re patient.” ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=1185))

- Much of the book is devoted to describing the different survival strategies used by ant species and to exploring how these different species have coevolved and competed with each other. This one book taught me more about economics than I’d learned in all my years at university. That may sound nuts, but it’s true. Why? Because an ant colony, like the economy, is a complex adaptive system. Reading about ants was a revelation. For example, it turns out that ant colonies operate by a ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=1486))

I realized instantly that I was discovering models that would be useful for me in analyzing the financial and economic world. My thoughts went to Munger and his latticework of mental models. So I sent him a copy of Journey to the Ants. To my delight, he replied with a short handwritten note, saying that he had long intended to read the book. Meanwhile, I resolved to spend more time reading books about biology. These studies deepened my sense that ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=1490))

This model offers intriguing insights into market crashes, which have much in common with these avalanches. For investors, the bottom line is to avoid states of self-organized criticality, which is essentially what occurred in the stock market before the crash of 2008–2009. The point is that the neat economic theories I had learned at university didn’t come close to describing the true complexities of the economy or the financial ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=1498))

To deal with my ADD, I needed to develop an array of simple work-arounds—for example, installing big clocks in my office to help me keep track of time, having a clear desk so that I wouldn’t get distracted, and putting objects in the same places so that I wouldn’t lose them quite so often.

Yet we expect this relatively puny hardware to make immensely complex calculations about the investing world, and we even have the audacity to hope that we might get these calculations right.

But there’s also another tool at our disposal: if we’re looking to make better investment decisions, it helps immeasurably to develop a series of rules and routines that we can apply consistently.

- of my decision-making process. Simplifying everything makes sense, given the brain’s limited processing power. The rules that I developed encompass a wide-ranging assortment of critical investment processes, including what I read (and in what order) when I’m researching stocks; whom I speak with (and refuse to speak with) about potential investments; how I deal with corporate management; how I trade stocks; and how I communicate (and don’t) with my shareholders.

Still, I’m convinced that it will help you enormously if you start thinking about your own investment processes in this structured, systematic way.

The complexity of the business and economic world, combined with our irrationality in the face of money-related issues, guarantees that we’ll make plenty of dumb mistakes.

Before I make the final decision to buy any stock, I turn to my checklist in a last-ditch effort to prevent my unreliable brain from overlooking any potential warning signs that I might have missed.

In December 2007, Gawande published a story in The New Yorker entitled “The Checklist,” which drew heavily on his experience as a surgeon to explore a problem that is both profound and practical. As he put it, “intensive-care medicine has grown so far beyond ordinary complexity that avoiding daily mistakes is proving impossible even for our super-specialists.” As he explained, this reflects a fundamental challenge that exists in other fields, too—namely, ([Location 2172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KF2JU2W&location=2172))
