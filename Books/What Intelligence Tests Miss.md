## Highlights
- Rational thinking skills of the type studied by Kahneman and Tversky show only small-to-medium correlations with intelligence test performance-not surprisingly, because tests of the latter make no direct assessment of the former.

- I'm also not very analytical. You know I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things.-President George W. Bush, aboard Air Force One, June 4, 2003 ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=78))

- Bush's cognitive deficiencies do not impair performance on intelligence tests, but they do impair rational decision making. His cognitive deficiencies instead are the causes of "dysrationalia" (an analogue of the word "dyslexia"), which is a term that I coined in the mid-iggos in order to draw attention to what is missing in IQ tests. I define dysrationalia as the inability to think and behave rationally despite having adequate intelligence. The president is, in fact, not unintelligent, but he may well be dysrationalic.And he is not alone. Many people display the ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=93))

- systematic inability to think or behave rationally despite the fact that they have more than adequate IQs. One of the reasons that many of us are dysrationalic to some extent is that, for a variety of reasons, we have come to overvalue the kinds of thinking skills that IQ tests measure and undervalue other… ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=96))

- Although most people would say that the ability to think rationally is a clear sign of a superior intellect, standard IQ tests devote no section to rationalthinking as cognitive scientists would define the term. To think rationally means adopting appropriate goals, taking the appropriate action given one's goals and beliefs, and holding beliefs that are commensurate with available evidence. Although IQ tests do assess the ability to focus on an immediate goal in the face of distraction, they do not assess at all whether a person has the tendency to… ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=98))

- For instance, when I lecture on how I think society has overvalued mental traits like intelligence and undervalued other traits such as rationality, someone in the audience will invariably respond with a variant of the rhetorical question "Well, would you want someone with an IQ of 92 doing surgery?" My answer is that perhaps not-but that I also would not want someone with a rationality quotient (RQ) of 93 serving on the judicial bench, someone with an RQ of 91 heading a legislature, someone with an RQ of 76 investing my retirement funds, someone with an RQ of 94 marketing the home I am selling, or a guidance counselor with an RQ of 83 advising the… ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=115))

- In fact, I will be saying none of these things-and in many instances I will be saying just the opposite. First, this is not a book about social or emotional skills. Because I questioned the comprehensiveness of standard IQ tests at the outset of this chapter, some may have thought that this was a signal that I was going to emphasize noncognitive domains. This is the strategy most commonly employed by critics of intelligence as it is conventionally measured with standard IQ tests. Critics of intelligence… ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=132))

- essential. For example, many largely noncognitive domains such as socioemotional abilities, motivation, empathy, and interpersonal skills are almost entirely unassessed by tests of cognitive ability. However, these standard critiques of intelligence tests often contain the unstated assumption that although intelligence tests miss certain key noncognitive areas, they encompass most of what is important cognitively. It is this unstated assumption that I am challenging. In fact, intelligence, as conventionally measured, leaves out many critical cognitive domains-domains of thinking itself. Some of the thinking domains that are missing are related to the ability to make optimal decisions at important choice points in life.In short, there is no need to look outside of the cognitive domain for things that IQ tests miss. However, when I say that… ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=135))

- to do with real life, or that the items on IQ tests are just parlor games related only "school smarts." Decades of research in psychology contradicts this view. IQ tests measure something that is cognitively real and that does relate to real life.In fact, the way we use the term intelligence in day-to-day discourse reveals that we do not think that it is so trivial after all. People are termed "bright" and "quick" and "smart" in ways that clearly indicate that it is not social or emotional qualities that we are talking about. And these terms are used often and nearly universally with positive connotations. In fact, "bright" and "quick" and "sharp" are used in general discourse to pick out precisely a quality assessed on standard IQ tests (something termed "fluid g" in the psychological literature). It may not be politically correct to laud IQ at certain cocktail parties… ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=141))

- The two dominant factors in the fluid/crystallized theory reflect a long history of considering two aspects of intelligence: intelligence-as-process (Gf) and intelligence-as-knowledge (Gc).The narrow view of intelligence then takes these operationally defined constructs-g, Gf, Gc-and validates them in studies of brain injury, educational attainment, cognitive neuroscience, developmental trends, and information processing. These constructs of the narrow theory are grounded in the types of mental abilities measured on traditional tests of intelligence.It might help the discussion of broad versus narrow views if we mark these abilities with an ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=233))

- easily remembered acronym-MAMBIT (to stand for: the mental abilities measured by intelligence tests). The narrow view of the intelligence concept, in viewing intelligence as MAMBIT, differs from the broad view in expressly not including in its primary definition a host of things that appear in broad theories: adaptation to the environment, real-life decision making, showing wisdom and creativity, etc. Notice that the contradictions that I discussed above in the phrases "smart but acting dumb" or "smart but acting foolish" do not occur if a narrow definition of intelligence is adopted - but they present a paradox if a broad view is adopted. On the former view, the "smart but acting foolish" phenomenon might occur quite frequently. Why? Simple really. On the narrow view, smart and foolish are two different things. Smart refers to the mental faculties that are specifically tapped by IQ tests (MAMBIT; most likely Gf). MAMBIT does not encompass variation in thequalities that lead to behavioral acts that we call dumb, stupid, or foolish-failure to show: judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=236))

The meaning of rationality in modern cognitive science is, in contrast, much more robust and important.'Cognitive scientists recognize two types of rationality: instrumental and epistemic. The simplest definition of instrumental rationality-the one that emphasizes most that it is… ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=264))

Economists and cognitive scientists have refined the notion of optimization of goal fulfillment into the technical notion of expected utility. The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility.' One discovery of modern decision science is that if people's preferences follow certain patterns (the so-called axioms of choice) then they are behaving as if they are maximizing utility-they are acting to get what they most want. This is what makes people's degrees of rationality measurable by the experimental methods of cognitive science. The deviation from the optimal choice pattern is an (inverse) measure of the degree of rationality.The other aspect of rationality… ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=269))

- The defining feature of Type r processing is its autonomy. Type r processes are termed autonomous because: r) their execution is rapid, 2) their execution is mandatory when the triggering stimuli are encountered, 3) they do not put a heavy load on central processing capacity (that is, they do not require conscious attention), 4) they are not dependent on input from high-level control systems, and 5) they can operate in parallel without interfering with each other or with Type 2 processing. Type i processing would include behavioral regulation by the emotions; the encapsulated modules for solving specific adaptive problems that have been posited by evolutionary psychologists; processes of implicit learning; and the automatic firing of overlearned associations 4 Type i processing, because of its computational ease, is a common processing default. Type i processes are sometimes termed the adaptive unconscious in order to emphasize that Type i processes accomplish a host of useful things-face recognition, proprioception, language ambiguity resolution, depth perception, etc. -all of which are beyond our awareness. Heuristic processing is a term often used for Type i processing-processing that is fast, automatic, and computationally inexpensive, and that does not engage in extensive analysis of all the possibilities.Type 2 processing contrasts with Type I processing on each of the critical properties that define the latter. Type 2 processing is relatively slow and computationally expensive-it is the focus of our awareness. Many Type 1 processes can operate at once in parallel, but only one Type 2 thought or a very few can be executing at once-Type 2 processing is ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=329))

- thus serial processing. Type 2 processing is often language based and rule based. It is what psychologists call controlled processing, and it is the type of processing going on when we talk of things like "conscious problem solving."One of the most critical functions of Type 2 processing is to override Type 1 processing. This is sometimes necessary because Type 1 processing is"quick and dirty." This so-called heuristic processing is designed to get you into the right ballpark when solving a problem or making a decision, but it is not designed for the type of fine-grained analysis called for in situations of unusual importance (financial decisions, fairness ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=338))

- intelligence tests will not routinely assess all aspects of cognitive functioning. There are many kinds of Type i processing that are important for us as a species, but on which there tend not to be large differences between people in the efficiency of functioning. Face recognition, syntactic processing, gaze direction detection, and kin recognition provide four examples of such domains.' This is why such processes are not assessed on intelligence tests. Intelligence tests are a bit like the personal ads in the newspaper-they are about the things that distinguish people, not what makes them similar. That is why the personals contain entries like "enjoy listening to ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=386))

- Miles Davis" but not "enjoy drinking when I'm thirsty."For this reason, intelligence tests do not focus on the autonomous Type i processing of the brain. Intelligence tests, instead, largely tap Type 2 processing. And they tap to a substantial extent the operation I have been emphasizing in this chapter-cognitive decoupling. Like all Type 2 processing, decoupling is a cognitively demanding operation. Decoupling operations enable hypothetical thinking. They must be continually in force during any ongoing mental simulations, and the raw ability to sustain such simulations while keeping the relevant representations decoupled is ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=390))

This is becoming clear from converging work on executive function and working memory, which both display correlations with intelligence that are quite high .9 The high degree of overlap in individual differences on working memory/executive functioning tasks and individual differences in intelligence is probably due to the necessity for sustained decoupling operations on all the tasks involved. Neurophysiological studies converge with this conclusion as well. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=393))

Crystallized intelligence (Gc) reflects declarative knowledge acquired from acculturated learning experiences. Thus, Type 2 processes are associated with Gf. I shall work Gc into the model shortly, but will first turn to an even more critical complication. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001UE6T46&location=396))

- We turn to the level of the reflective mind when we ask questions about the goals of the system's computations (what the system is attempting to compute and why). In short, the reflective mind is concerned with the goals of the system, beliefs relevant to those goals, and the choice of action that is optimal given the system's goals and beliefs. It is only at the level of the reflective mind that issues of rationality come into play. Importantly, the algorithmic mind can be evaluated in terms of efficiency but not rationality.
