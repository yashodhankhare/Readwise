## Highlights
- I will outline how you go about finding this relevant information and how to focus on four critical factors, or BASM:B usiness model,A ssumptions,S trategy, andM anagement. Investors who learn to focus on BASM become the investors who invest for the greatest gains. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=88))

- To use BASM and the tools and concepts of successful investing, we need to stop doing the things which, although typical of human behavior, constitute beating ourselves. We need, then, to follow the Seven Steps: knowledge patience disciplines emotions time horizon market timing benchmarks ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=99))

- We all like to feel that we can predict certain things, but we also know that reality says we rarely can do it accurately. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=109))

- But when I get to know the CEO of a company well, I can start to understand how he or she will react to new situations. Although you may not be able to actually meet with CEOs, you can certainly read up on their track records, public statements about their company, and articles about them—in short, get to know what you truly need to know about them as you learn the techniques in this book. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=110))

- Today, the Internet and other resources make it possible for you to learn all about who a CEO truly is. You can find out things right at your desk that I and other professionals had to research through travel, meetings, and phone calls. You can predict the behavior of your closest family members and friends in certain situations, so even if you cannot predict the behavior of CEOs quite as well, you can still separate the great ones from the rest. That’s what it’s all about. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=113))

- Research analysts do great research but think differently from money managers, and are generally not very good stock pickers. (Good analysts understand the importance of BASM, but they don’t follow the logic of the Seven Steps—and that makes a big difference.)

- Why do I make this unequivocal statement? Because I began my career as an analyst and evolved into a stock picker. Instead of imposing the detailed history of my own career on you at this point, I will unfold the parts that will help you, through stock stories, as the book goes on, showing you why BASM and the Seven Steps have made me very successful—and how they showed me the way to help a lot of others make a great deal of money. My experience is the reason this book is about stock picking, not securities analysis. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=148))

- As our long lunch drew to a close, my host took the check and pulled from his pocket a huge roll of bills that looked as if it could choke a water buffalo. My eyes grew wide in wonder. I couldn’t help asking Dave if he always carried around so much cash. “Oh, I guess so,” he replied casually. “I have a lot of money in a drawer, and I just pull out a bunch when I think I need some. Frankly, I don’t think about money at all. I started with nothing and became very wealthy investing, and I don’t need to work. I come to work because it is fun, and I love it, and I love picking great stocks.” ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=170))

- Countless investors were shaken out of great stocks because something happened that made the overall market go down, and they just plain bolted for the door. The difference was that they did not build deep knowledge of the company behind the stock—the kind of deep knowledge that keeps you in the stock when the market fluctuates, the kind of deep knowledge that makes you want to buy more stock, and the kind of knowledge that keeps you in the stock for a very long time.

- Using stories that are both educational and entertaining,The Big Money reveals the best methods to simplify stock picking and to stop defeating ourselves. You will hear from one of the greatest investors of the 1920s and see how he describes investors beating themselves almost a century ago. This, unfortunately, is still the case with most people today. We are all emotional creatures, and busy and swamped with information and data, but far too many of us have no obvious “navigation chart.” ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=229))

- The reasons why Sears fell and Wal-Mart rose are directly related to business model and management, and if one looked hard at the key elements of their stated strategies, what the management was doing, and the main parts of the business model, instead of just extrapolating the momentum of earnings and analysts’ estimates, it was all there to see.

- Most of the time, it does not matter whether a company is a drugstore or a software company. What does matter is whether it has an open-ended market opportunity and a great BASM to take advantage of that opportunity.

- This is not a history book; it is a book of great lessons to teach you to recognize what will make you rich. Nevertheless, history shows us which companies have generated the huge gains for stockholders and why. We all need this perspective in order to recognize great investments in the years ahead. Investors who wonder how Google will fare are far better off if they understand what happened to all the great search-engine companies that came earlier, from Alta Vista and WebCrawler to Lycos and others, concentrating on companies’ descriptions of how they would grow and be profitable—the business models.

- I listen carefully as debates rage today about Google—the “poster child” for what people hope is the big opportunity stock—and others such as Apple and its iPod, Netflix, TiVo, nanotechnology companies, and more. Debates over Google are most often about its valuation based on price-to-earnings ratio. But for every time investors wish they had sold a “seemingly” expensive stock, there are many instances when they sold stocks that could have made them rich, because they had no guide other than “conventional valuation arithmetic”—they didn’t know what to look for.

- Everything repeats. This is a huge plus, and a huge secret to making money with stocks. Learn to recognize things that you will see again and again, and you will be way ahead of many other investors. This is true equally for winners and losers.

- Looking at earnings is important, of course, and I will discuss how one does this, but it is the golden goose that creates those earnings on which we must focus in order to simplify and to understand the great stocks. BASM, or some version of it, worked very well for me in my stock selection and in building a record that was one of the five best in the country for fifteen years. It has also worked for many more of the best stock pickers in the country. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=313))

- I did not stay nervous all that long. I read some more and found that the specific technology products a company sells can be less important than how the company manages the development and evolution of that technology, how it works with its customers, how it markets its products and services, and finally, how it manages itself. There were, and there are, a lot of good technologies, but very few good, let alone great, technology companies.

- The Krehbiels, the family who ran Molex, were a solid midwestern family management team who had worked together for years to grow the company, which had been founded in 1938 to manufacture inexpensive molding materials for toys and flowerpots. Now they wanted to use their great storehouse of manufacturing knowledge and years of experience to enter a more dynamic market. They had chosen electrical connectors, because they looked a few years ahead and believed that electrical connectors would have a great future. This is a great example of the assumptions component of BASM. Molex made assumptions about why electrical connectors would be a great business to be in, and those assumptions were critical to its success. (Years later, Microsoft made assumptions that the marketplace would want standard software and would not hop around from one hot product to another. These assumptions made the company willing to make no profit at all on some early offerings just to “lock up” customers.)

- Acquiring in-depth knowledge leads to genuine confidence. Both are essential to make the big money. Knowledge was an early key to investment success for me.

- I learned in high school physics the old story about the bird flying past the window. An unsophisticated observer might assume that the bird would just fly on and on in the same direction indefinitely, but a thoughtful person would not extrapolate that way. So I did not assume that what I observed would just continue on indefinitely. Analysts extrapolate as much as they analyze in some cases, using earnings as well as corporate product cycles. This is one of the all-time greatest pitfalls that prevent people from making big money: assuming too much. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=374))

- “Staying close to the customer” is hard, and expensive, but it pays off. Companies such as Molex, Cisco, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart have a business model that is heavily weighted toward understanding the most important needs of customers and then creating a way of meeting those needs, present and future.

- An average company does not develop a deep enough understanding of customers’present and future needs. Most companies have a “financial fear factor” that keeps them from doing what it takes, since they often make short-term decisions to maximize profits. Spending money on customers’ needs, though, maximizes future profits and growth and helps to lock in customers—a critical element in repeatability.

- Making a lot of money with Molex was a classic case of how knowledge goes hand in hand with wealth. Successful investors start with knowledge. The more knowledge you have, the more money you will make. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=415))

- Naturally, because markets and stocks have volatility, knowledge is a great asset to have. Knowledge brings confidence, and confidence is what keeps people in stocks that are undergoing price pressures yet continue to have great growth in earnings. Confidence is what helps successful investors to buy more shares when prices dip, while investors who do not know what they own become emotional and sell out of fear and lack of knowledge. Knowledge reduces risk. As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Knowledge is the antidote to fear.” When you have knowledge, you can invest a lot more money to make far bigger gains. Thus,know what you own, and why you own it. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=417))

- It did not occur to me in my early days that a parking lot could be a great source of information for investors, but ever since I heard from a colleague about a McDonald’s parking lot, I do not count out anything. When I began to cover McDonald’s for our company, I visited with management, talked to good Wall Street analysts, and read everything I could. I expanded my knowledge. I also made it a point to talk to franchise operators. I even walked into restaurants to see if there were patterns or trends or other bits of information that I could pick up. I liked to talk to people who used the products. I wanted to know what it was that made people go to McDonald’s in droves, particularly more so than to other hamburger restaurants. I remembered what Dave had done to acquire so much knowledge about Xerox at the very beginning. I saw with my own eyes and heard from customers that consistency, quality, and cleanliness were there, and were very important factors. Those factors were built into the core of the McDonald’s business model, so it became evident that a hamburger restaurant does not succeed just on tasty food. It must be differentiated; the restaurant needs a real business model that can stand the heat of the competitive kitchen, so to speak. I had tried very hard to get all the portfolio managers at Wellington Management Company to buy the stock, but the group in Philadelphia (I was in Boston), led by legendary “value stock” buyer John Neff, had always felt the stock was a bit expensive. They were unsure whether the company could stay differentiated long enough to justify the higher price. But one day I heard in the morning investment meeting over the speakers that connected our offices that John Nyheim, a senior associate of Neff’s, had bought the stock into their portfolios. I asked Nyheim about it. I was pleased that the group had done so, but I noted that they had resisted buying earlier for the reasons I mentioned (and because John had stated that he personally did not like the burgers). John said, “Yes, Fred, that is correct. But first of all, I now go there because my kids love it, and they make me go. Second,” he added, “when I go there, it is always full and hard to park at. And third, it is the only place I go where there is a full array of every car, from the Volkswagen Beetle to the best Mercedes. This company serves a very broad market with mass appeal—thatis a great market!” These things had changed his mind. I could see that John Nyheim, a great investor, had an open mind, which is one of the best weapons of a great investor. Great investors do change their opinions. They are not trying to declare the truth; they are trying to find it. Moreover, John was doing what I liked to do—he was looking at the users of the product and studying the marketplace. One does not need to learn great lessons every day—there are only so many—but one has to remember them anduse them. That is how great investors become great, and that is how to… ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=438))

- I looked at how tiny a share of the restaurant market McDonald’s (MCD) had, and knew that if it executed well, it could grow strongly for many years before it had much of a share. Then, I looked at the company’s projections for opening new restaurants, and the revenues of the whole company, divided by the number of stores out there, to get the average amount of revenue and profits per store (annual report), for starters. Even though new restaurants take a little time to get to good profitability, it was easy to see from these numbers that MCD would grow very strongly, and I felt that the P/E of the stock did not reflect that outlook (see chapter 4 on how to measure stock price to earnings and to growth rates in a simple way). My own arithmetic on this, which is easy even if you do not like math, said to me that estimates could easily be low. Reading about the brilliance of the company’s systems gave me knowledge and confidence that execution would be great. Execution from BASM and the number of new restaurants that were opening told me to buy. Keep in mind that with all quality stocks, the professionals do not have any advantage over anyone… ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=473))

- Moreover, there are plenty of companies worth getting to know in depth that have operations right in your city or town, particularly national chains and franchises. Go in there and look at the company from acustomer’s perspective. Get a real feeling for the location and the facility, and experience how the company delivers its service or products. This is what the military calls reconnaissance. Before you make your move, find out what the terrain is like—become familiar with a company’s reality, not just abstractions about it or what management claims. Real confidence comes when you have read the annual reports and releases from management, and then looked for yourself. It may sound too simple, but, in fact, ensuring that what they claim about themselves and what their customers think of them are the same will help you identify winners.

- YOU NEED A SYSTEM Everybody who plays blackjack and some other casino games hears about people who try to develop a system to beat the house. Well, in many industries and companies, a proprietary system is the company’s equivalent of beating the house. It helps the company to beat the competition by doing things better while also achieving higher profits and growth to drive stock prices. Management plans the strategy and implements the business model—the path to profitability—but management has to execute the details of the plan. An investor needs as much relevant knowledge about these factors as he or she can acquire. Knowledge is such an important element in differentiating companies that slip and slide from those that excel that I want to go into a little detail so you can truly understand what differentiated MCD, and still differentiates it. Operational differentiation and excellence are concepts that will apply to many companies that you will invest in. For instance, we know that Intel has excelled over the years by continually coming out with the best new microprocessor chips to serve as the brains for personal computers. The Intel systems create repeatability, so for decades big computer manufacturers felt that Intel would always have reliability in its new chips, not just new chips. When Apple recently wanted to switch from IBM chips, for a number of reasons, including lowering the amount of heat radiated by a chip, it could have chosen a cheaper chip from a clone of Intel chips. But Apple chose Intel for reliability and repeatability as well as lower heat radiation and other characteristics. Many investors do not know that one of the core reasons for Intel’s huge success with its customers, aside from great product research and development, is that it spends a fortune on research and development inproduction methods and systems. In other words, after you have a winning semiconductor design, you have to produce it with the lowest number of defects and rejects and potential problems with chips. To produce huge numbers of chips quickly, ship them to customers fast, keep costs in line, and ensure a minimum number of defects, you need awesome production systems. These systems have to be intelligently designed, and they cost lots of money. Intel was smart to do this. So, what kind of systems do you need for a hamburger chain? Well, your customers are not going to be happy if they have been to one or more restaurants where they wait only 110 seconds for their fast food then go to another one in the same chain and have to wait several times that long, let alone taste any difference in the same food. That is bad business. It costs the restaurants goodwill and money. McDonald’s is a company that understands that if the hamburger bun is presliced all the way through, not just partly, it saves time and money and speeds up the process. Originally, the first wave of operational elements that Ray Kroc introduced allowed the company to lower the price… ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=561))

- McDonald’s came into an existing market and just plain did things a lot better. The real great growth stories are those about companies with really big markets or demand and an opportunity to do it better. There is a long list of small companies that became big this way. Companies that fill a niche do not necessarily get really big or become great, but they can. The niche, though, limits them, so bigger companies often acquire them.

- One huge market that had no technology attached to it was package delivery. Just as locating restaurants intelligently and lowering prices and raising quality can enlarge a market that has already demonstrated growth, so can technology increase the growth and size of the package-delivery market. That is exactly what happened with Federal Express (FDX), now known as FedEx. Just as Ray Kroc had the vision to start things off right, maintaining slow growth until the systems and management team were in place, the genius of FDX was Fred Smith, who had a vision of what could be done for express delivery of important packages. In fact, Smith wrote a paper while an undergrad at Yale University about the methods and routes used by airfreight shippers and why they were inadequate. He maintained that a system should be developed for time-sensitive shipments of things such as computer parts, medicines, and electronics. After graduating from college and serving in the military, Smith went into the aviation business and, before long,… ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=601))

- The top management people in Xerox were risk-averse and did not have or build a “technology” culture, which would have made a huge difference. Federal Express build a technology culture to support its future from its early years. Eventually, Xerox became complacent. As its patents expired, it should have expected exactly what it got: ferocious competition and inroads from the Japanese and others. So think of early Xerox as you think of any current “hot” technology company, and remember that the business model later failed. There was norepeatability.

- BASM REMAINS THE KEY Remember, do not invest in products, invest in the golden goose that creates both the product cycles and the earnings growth. That golden goose is defined by BASM. Go back to the four defining attributes of great companies: business model, assumptions, strategy, and management. Even more important, look at these examples of companies that can evolve and control much of their destiny. Not many technology companies qualify as great companies. First of all, many are so wrapped up in aggressive product introductions that they fail to pay sufficient attention to developing and changing their business model and management as circumstances dictate. Second, many tech companies have customers that are economically sensitive, and this, in turn, makes them economically sensitive, which means that many do not deliver reliable, steady growth. Repeatable results are essential. The tech companies that do become great are those that “renew” themselves, like Intel, or that have near monopolies but also innovate all the time, like Microsoft, or that have brilliant and resilient business models, like Dell.

- Thus, as you really understand how to differentiate the exceptional company from the ordinary, you know that you should give it some leeway on the valuation, since buying those stocks back is so difficult. Which of the many new Internet companies will succeed? Think of success as high profitability and growth, protection from competition, and repeatability. BASM is what I rely on. I think Amazon could develop to be great, but it needs to further tweak its business model and raise return on assets and profit margins. I do think it is likely to get there. I certainly hope so. Jeff Bezos is a great manager who conceived a great idea. Like Kroc and his team at McDonald’s, Bezos has broadened Amazon’s menu, so to speak, because he has developed systems that can sell and ship much more than just records and books. I do think eBay and Yahoo! meet the tests and are great companies. Yahoo! is certainly going to give Google some pressure. Other companies in this field have not yet established themselves as great. One should always be looking to find, buy, and hold “the great one.” ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=683))

- For companies that have the potential to be great, you measure their performance (i.e., earnings and market share) against the goals they set for themselves. Reading company reports, you will find that the better the company, the more specific its goals. Great companies issue their own report cards. The lesser ones do not do this very well, and often can only offer excuses because they are losing to the great companies. Market-share gains and losses are core indicators to watch, but they must be watched for a few years to allow strategies to unfold and also to let stocks perform and make you great profits. It is not enough to just say, “Hey, when you own the greatest companies, do not sell them. Hold on to try to make 10X or 100X your money, or more—that is what the best stocks can do.” ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=720))

- It is a shame that so often investors treat the stocks of potentially huge winners just the same as those that are ordinary. You may sell a stock after a 30 percent quick gain and feel great—if it is a company that really doesn’t show you that it has the elements of great BASM. But if you are thinking more about taking a quick profit than getting really rich, and you sell, you may well find yourself watching the stock go on to double or triple after you sold it. Naturally you are reluctant to buy it back at much higher prices, so typically it is gone. If it is on its way to greatness, it might ultimately multiply investors’ money by 200X. All you need is one, so understanding how to combine the elements of BASM with the Seven Steps is the way to go, starting with the patience and benchmarks that can help you to keep and capitalize on that one if you have bought it.

- You are looking for metrics, starting with growth. Growth in earnings will grow your investment over time. Metrics show you how the company’s BASM is working for investors. All companies must do what they have said they will do. That starts with growth in sales and growth in earnings that are better than those of their competitors, so they take market share and perhaps become number one. Profits divided by assets, or return on capital (ROC, which is the same as return on assets), is a critical metric for all companies and a key predictor of future growth. Some take the equity figure on the balance sheet and divide profits by equity—return on equity (ROE)—which is fine. But that does not ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=767))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- take into account debt financing, so ROC plus ROE is the metric I look at. Another metric that tells you how a company is doing relative to others is profit margin—both the gross margin (sales less cost of sales divided by sales) and the net margin (profits before taxes divided by sales). Do not use formulas, but just learn to compare companies against other companies in the same industry, since it is all relative, and you are looking for winners and the best bet, not for absolute numbers. If you read annual reports, you will also find metrics that managers give for their own industries. For example, same-store sales (announced frequently) for retailers tell you how stores open for equal amounts of time are doing relative to the prior period. Other metrics include loan figures for banks, traffic figures, and load factors (seat miles filled by passengers versus seat miles of capacity flown) for airlines, and so forth. You can find this information and apply it in a commonsense way to determine the health of a company as you acquire deeper knowledge and know what to expect. Operating metrics are like hits and runs in baseball: they show you what is going on. Good companies make it easy for you to learn this. The point about using metrics is to make an informed judgment about a company’s potential to glimpse the future. Projecting what a company can earn, or earnings power, is one key to staying in the stock. This sort of knowledge will give you confidence that you have a great company, or even a very good company with competitive strengths and excellent management.

- companies that seem to have relative predictability. Huge gains generally come from emerging companies on their way to success. We have all heard the legendary stories of those who did not stay with Coke in its early days; some stockholders sold whenever the market got a bit difficult. The sellers did not recognize what Coke really was, did not see the potential, and gave up huge fortunes. But later, when Coke was established and large, there was still a tremendous amount of money to be made. Consider the 1982 downturn. Those who held on to stocks during the 1982 market downturn, or bought then, could see 5X their money in five years from a large, secure company. The high gains continued until the stock reached its top in the 2000 market, having risen roughly 68X, or 6,700 percent, from the 1982 price. Coke was far from an emerging growth story. This wealth came from Coca-Cola as an established company when it was doing everything right for most of those years.

- company, the downturns are most likely temporary; and when the market gets emotional and sells off, those drops give long-term investors chances to scoop up their favorite companies at very attractive prices. If a stock has a nice, smooth trajectory upward, people do not sell very often and just enjoy the ride. Almost always, though, the ride is not so smooth, because there are so many instances of various economic, financial, psychological, and political events affecting markets. There always have been and always will be periods of real pressure on stock prices that worry people, or even scare them. Very often these pressures cause investors to sell their shares. As I noted earlier, the majority of investors do not seem to buy them back. Sometimes this has to do with a lack of knowledge or other tangible investment input, but quite frequently it has to do with human psychology, and the fact that people who sell something, then later see it at a higher price, have a mental block about buying it back. I mention this because it is very, very common. What isuncommon is the commitment of investors who can be patient and hold on to companies that can make them truly wealthy. They do it by “sitting tight,” as Jesse Livermore pointed out early in the twentieth century. Having patience and buy/sell discipline and following the rest of the Seven Steps will serve you well because you are very likely to encounter and even own some of these companies.

- they make mistakes. My approach was to ensure that my mistakes were small—that is, if I doubted that things were going right, I would sell, perhaps because a company was not executing well at the moment. So, yes, I made a bunch of mistakes, but they were almost always small. But you should also do what I do after I sell: watch the company and its stock’s performance carefully for a while. If it starts to recover, it could be showing you elements of greatness. That is when you must buy it back, even if you pay up a few dollars. I did that plenty of times, and it is very helpful and profitable. Being a great company does not mean being perfect, so this is important to incorporate into your investing.

- RISKS You cannot pretend there are no risks in investing, but you can deal with risks and learn to minimize them. Knowledge is the best weapon against risk. Although there are statistical ways to measure risk, they fail to capture the difference between knowing what you own and not knowing. To me, the most important factors are knowledge of your investment and an investor’s way of looking at things (BASM).

- One of the cardinal sins of investing, I have learned, is treating the greatest companies just like all the other investments you own. It is the single biggest reason why a large number of investors never make the big money. Here is one more quotation from Jesse Livermore, a great investor who made millions in 1923, when that was an incredible amount of money: “They say you never grow poor taking ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=951))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- profits. No, you don’t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.” Livermore talked about how people have to bet against their emotions and continue to have hope when they feel fear, and remember fear when they feel great hope; this means that people naturally feel more comfortable going with the herd whether the herd is extremely bullish or bearish. You have to avoid being one of the herd, and try to know enough to lean against the herd. This is certainly one way of saying “buy low and sell high,” since fear is one of the strongest forces that depress stock prices, and lower prices create more fear. Stock prices are at their highest when hope and greed are at their highest. As I have pointed out, the things that Livermore (for Lefèvre) wrote about in 1923 were true for countless generations before then and are true today because of human nature. That is why people need a method to become patient and to become rich. Whether you do it with disciplines of your own making or not, many, many investors have found that the right path includes knowledge, buy and sell disciplines, time horizons, and more—in other words, what I have collectively called the Seven Steps.

- Dominance is worth a lot in the stock market. This was how and when Nike became “Nike.” There is no question that it is tough to know who will win and how long earnings can stay down. There is no question that if one watches a stock going down, a strong stomach is needed. Most companies that have a couple of down quarters in earnings are not executing well, and many are outright sales. But if one thinks there is any possibility that the company in question is a great company, then the downdraft makes it a buy. BASM once again is the way to know this, and the Seven Steps are the way to capitalize on it and make the money.

- Telling somebody to “buy low and sell high” does not work without further knowledge, because investors need to know what factors lead to low and high prices, as well as what “high” means on a given day.

They also need to understand that time horizons and knowledge lead to an ability to be patient with companies that have the potential to be great.

- Home Depot. Now, one could say (and I have said!) that selling was a terrible idea, because even if great companies are temporarily overvalued, leeway should be given on the valuation sell discipline, since great companies so often do surprise us all on the upside with earnings and company performance. Yes, if you know it is a great company, you might want to take your lumps and stick with it. After all, employees most often just sit tight, are patient, and ignore short-term market moves. I needed to learn that a bit better, and over time I did. With stocks like Home Depot, employees who behave this way are right. Institutional investors have a disadvantage in that we do not want to underperform similar funds for a year. Yet most of us will buy back a stock and not be afraid just because the market is not going up. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1081))

- PATIENCE MEANS RISKS BUT ALSO MEANS A COMPENSATING PAYOFF This is a classic example of why more patience is warranted with the greatest companies. First, they are more likely to fix mistakes, and so price moves by impatient investors become huge buying opportunities. Second, while it is always risky to stay with or buy back (if you do sell) companies that are fixing a problem, patience has a far, far bigger payoff with the great companies than with an average stock. The payoff usually means many times your investment at the least, and getting rich at the best. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1096))

- BENCHMARKS Benchmarks are simple, yet they are quite important for success. The first type of benchmark has to do with stocks. You need to establish what you expect at the outset when you invest. Write down what you anticipate for a growth rate and whether you agree with consensus estimates out there on future earnings. If not, write down the reasons. Have a spiral notebook to jot down your expectations with the date and price, and your sources of the buy idea. Then write down your sources of information to track this company (including phone numbers if the information involves specific people) and the factors that would make you sell (i.e., think about the buy disciplines). That is one of several reasons why “tips” are dangerous—you do not know when to sell or even have a way to track an investment if you do not have regular information from the source of the tip. Benchmarks for Your Portfolio As I said at the beginning of this chapter, the two most important benchmarks are: (1) how your investments—funds or stocks—are tracking over time against similar investments, and (2) having a proper time frame of at least three years, preferably five. Other kinds of benchmarks are metrics by which to measure a company’s progress, such as market share gains. Another benchmark is earnings and a company’s performance. Look at a trend line of earnings and sales and use that as a benchmark. It is good if there is acceleration and a company is above the trend line. Seeing it below the trend line does not necessarily mean bad things but should alert you to the need to find out what is going on. Looking at different periods of time and calculating the growth rate over three years, five years, or even ten years creates the trend line. Nike spent a lot of money, temporarily lowering profits, but the spending achieved its goal of taking market share. Moreover, its trend of revenue growth became better. Profits fell and were below trend, but knowing the other things gave me confidence in great profits to come. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1104))

- If you have mutual funds, it is important that you use one of the various rating services such as Lipper or Morningstar, or read quality financial publications to know how your funds are doing. Each fund will be matched against other funds in its specific category, so a benchmark is to use the category and look at an appropriate time horizon. One-year time horizons are just too short, as the mutual-fund guru Jack Bogle has always said, along with other experts.

- Looking at DEC’s valuations based on the price divided by the expected earnings for the coming year, as well as dividing the price by the sales (either per share or for all the stock—total shares outstanding times price per share—and the entire company revenues), I saw that this company had become super-expensive compared with other similar companies and with its own price and valuation history. I use those comparisons a lot and do give leeway to companies with greatness in their BASM or greatness in what we expect their next product cycle to be, so we do not get trapped by mechanical arithmetic. But I recognize that great change and improvement do get higher valuations. However, if you refer back to things I have said earlier about valuations, when the differences between the valuation of other companies (and also valuations throughout a company’s own history) start to accelerate or perhaps are 25 percent or so above where they “should” be, I tend to think emotions are playing a larger role ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1332))

- site. There are big lessons here for investors. A central one is that those individual investors who read the stories and know about the companies they own, or are considering owning, are always ready to think and to act. So, when markets swing up and down—not just in a big crash, but also in the normal course of events—you do not have to start scrambling. You already know the story, and you are just looking at the price. Knowledge, the first and most important of the Seven Steps, should always be there to tap into, ready to apply to the disciplines. I knew the stories in my portfolio, meaning I knew what I owned. By adding money to my current holdings, I was increasing the number of shares I owned at lower prices. We all know the old adage “Buy low and sell high,” but emotions often make people do exactly the opposite. With those stocks that plunge, it is what we call theFUD factor —fear, uncertainty, and doubt, arising from an emotional feeling that the market must know more than we do, while greed seems to increase the more a stock goes up. Fundamentals frequently become pushed aside by emotions without some structure to focus and use knowledge. But BASM and the Seven Steps are very likely to have you follow this useful adage properly (buying low; selling high), and that was what I was doing: selling stocks that were going down.

- Lesson: Knowing the story—a story anybody could have known—and combining that knowledge with the three buy disciplines were the key to making huge money. The end of the story did come true, as earnings did exactly what Phil Knight intended and what we, in turn, had expected. In fact, the earnings soared for half a decade. One more important thing. After Nike’s IPO, I made a lot of money on a small position, and saw earnings really triple in a little over two years. The uncertainly of the shoe business and countless competitors did mean that as much as I liked Phil Knight from my meetings or equally from what I read, I wanted to watch Nike operate and execute the business model. Aggressive expansion caused earnings and stock volatility along the way, and I took some lumps (stock declines). Yet the keys were: (1) Knight responded well to changing conditions; (2)critically, Nike was taking market share—the path to dominance; and (3) I was running five miles per day ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1466))

- It is simple to add other things, such as patience. The legendary investor Warren Buffett said in a 1999 interview withBusiness Week: “Success in investing doesn’t correlate with I.Q. once you’re above the level of twenty-five. Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.” Most people who take investing seriously have far more intelligence than they need for being successful in their investing. I have maintained throughout my career that investing is not an I.Q. contest. As for temperament, that may work for the few, but it does not work alone for most people. You need to control emotions to have the right temperament. I do know that Warren Buffett made his vast fortune in the markets (Buffett is the second wealthiest person in the world, after Bill Gates) not only because of his wisdom, knowledge, and skills, but also because he developed a personal style of investing and disciplines that worked for him. The “rule on the rules” is that they must be easy rules that can be applied consistently time after time, without requiring an investor to do highly complex things that are impractical.

- UNDERSTANDING VALUATIONS To guess is cheap. To guess wrongly is very expensive. C—HINESEPROVERB Throughout this book, I emphasize a holistic approach to companies and their stocks—looking at the whole enterprise, not microanalyzing pieces. By using that framework, particularly the business model, you can put earnings growth in context, without trying to be a securities analyst. Many investors know that to estimate valuations, earnings, and the direction of the economy is for professional investors. Some investors are better at it than others, but nobody has consistently accurate earnings estimates that last a year or more unless we are talking about the great companies that are pretty predictable and help investors with a lot of guidance—and then, you can do this yourself without breathing hard.

- Valuations are part science and part art, and a great subject of endless debate among professionals, both as to how to do them, and about what any company is worth at any time. The referee, or judge, is the market, which sets a value on the shares of every stock. For making money, of course, we all debate not what the market says shares are worth at one moment, but what they should really be worth right now and particularly in the future. We can do some things to help estimate that, I believe. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1586))

- career, wrote the first college economics textbook I used. Samuelson once said that Wall Street indices predicted nine out of the last five recessions. Although he kind of jokes here, most good stock pickers understand that this statement is correct. You cannot forecast the economy with enough accuracy or far enough in advance of events to bet your stock money on it. I see three reasons why economic forecasts are so often wrong or misleading. First: Economies are very complex, and this complexity is exaggerated greatly by globalization (an area in which no economists have much experience). Since economics is a social science, in which changes occur as a result of human behavior, behavioral influences are very difficult to know with enough certainty. Second: Good forecasts, or at least those that appear to be good, are believed and thus change how people behave in their spending and investing and other economic variables. This effect, in turn, can change outcomes so that the forecasts have to be adjusted along the way. Some forecasts may be very good, relatively speaking, and they might then change behavior. Third: Economists build models from data and use data to discover historical cause-and-effect relationships. Even though computers were around in the late 1940s and 1950s, there was no widespread use of them until the PC era began, and so we have a very short history of data from many sectors and businesses. That undermines the ability of economists to be accurate. For example the recession after the bubble burst in 2000 (there was a stock market bubble and an economic bubble built on business ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1599))

- Despite all that I just said about the unpredictability of the economy in the short term, since people are very emotional creatures, when they read that the economy is getting better or worse, they tend to get greedy or fearful and “bet” with their emotions instead of investing with knowledge.

You cannot let an economic forecast change how you feel about a great company with a great management and business model—not if you want real wealth.

- There is a short list of simple valuation tools that work, particularly if you use more than one each time; this list is what I call triangulation. If using arithmetic or simple formulas alone could tell you when to buy and sell, investing in stocks would be very simple, wouldn’t it? Keep in mind that commonsense judgments, including judgments about which tools to use and when, are a big part of everything in life. They include deciding when to buy and sell stocks. With that said, here are some helpful tools. Say that you are unsure about how expensive your stock is.The Big Money focuses especially on growth stocks and those with high growth rates, so let’s stick to that part of the world. For starters, although this is common, looking at the trailing twelve months’ earnings relative to price does not properly measure a growth company’s valuation relative to other companies. So take company A, selling for $20. It earned $1 per share over the past twelve months. It is selling for 20X those earnings. If it is estimated to grow earnings by 20 percent over the next year or more, the estimate would be $1.20 and the P/E, or price-to-earnings ratio—a basic core measure—is the price of $20 over the estimate of $1.20, or 16.67X earnings. Company B, selling for $25, also earned $1 over the last twelve months. It would be 25X the trailing earnings; a lot more expensive than 20X. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1680))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But if this company is estimated to grow earnings at 40 percent per year for a while, we can take the $25 price over the estimate of $1.40 and get a forward P/E of only 17.8X. So company B is growing twice as fast as company A, and is only slightly higher in “price,” as we say—price meaning the price-to-earnings ratio. Here is one way to see how much cheaper this is. I like to use the P/E-compared-with-growth rate, orPEG ratio . P/E-to-growth shows you how to compare a company with other similar growth companies and also with its own history—something mentioned in this book a number of times—and then you know if something is getting cheaper or more expensive. The P/E-to-growth of company A is 16.67 divided by 20 (the growth rate), for a PEG ratio of 0.8335. That’s kind of cheap. You need to take a bunch of these ratios in any given stock market to see what is cheap and what is expensive, by the way, and only a few minutes of doodling will tell you what you want to know. Company B, measured the same way, computes a P/E of 17.8X divided by a growth rate of 40, for a PEG ratio of 0.445. That is much, much cheaper, even though the price and the P/E are higher. Using the trailing twelve months’ earnings to compare high-growth-rate stocks can be highly misleading, but PEG ratios are a good tool. Also, just compare P/Es with prior periods and other stocks. This comparison tells you a lot. Here’s another trick: take a calculator and see how many years it would take the earnings to reach the current share price of the stock if the company grew at the same rate all the time. For company A, you would need to compound the earnings of $1 at the growth rate of 20 percent ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1690))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- per year for seventeen years to reach the share price of $20. For company B it would take only ten years for those earnings to reach the current share price. This is just an exercise to show you differentials, of course, but it does paint a dramatic picture sometimes. When you do this, also, it reminds you that companies usually do not maintain a high growth rate for seventeen or even ten years. There are changes. There is risk. Use all numbers judiciously and wisely, but this is a starting place. Using BASM is one good way to monitor a company and assess relative risk between companies with similar growth rates, by the way. Triangulation, or using several tools, is always the best way of using numbers to augment the core principles of analyzing management, business models, assumptions, and strategies. Don’t go crazy with numbers, though; they will not do your work for you. Growth-stock investors do not get rich with formulas; they just use formulas as a guide to make comparisons. If one thing is critical, it is that most money flows from what is bad or overvalued to what is good and undervalued, so this is a relative game. That is why I always say that comparing similar growth stocks with each other and with their own… ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1702))

- I will add two more valuation methods to help investors triangulate. One is price-to-book value. Book value per share is the assets of a company minus the liabilities, divided by number of shares. These numbers are found on the company’s balance sheet. This asset-base valuation method is not as frequently used as the earnings approaches, but it is a very good benchmark when you look at it relative to other companies, and it is quick and easy. I like the price-to-sales approach a lot. That is the total market value of a company’s stock outstanding (total shares times current price for the equity market capitalization, ormarket cap ) divided by the revenues of the company for the current year or Wall Street analysts’ estimates. You can also take revenues per share and price per share to do this calculation. Most money is not coming into or out of the market, but flowing from one security to another. The flow is based on investors’ collective feelings about the valuations and prospects for companies, so using relative valuations is very helpful. These simple tools will help you understand the reports you see. Once again we want to focus not on the golden eggs, or earnings,… ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1713))

- The human tendency to extrapolate, as mentioned in chapter 2, means taking events and assuming they are trends, or taking earnings growth and assuming it is like the bird that flies by the window and keeps going at the same speed in the same direction, indefinitely. It is not limited to investors, but is often as costly for investors as it was to Grook. There is a spectrum of investors in the markets, with the far left end of that spectrum being the “Neanderthal” investors, who extrapolate only from product cycles, earnings, growth trends, and more, and win a certain number of times before they lose heavily, get wiped out, or get out of the market entirely. At the far right end of the spectrum are those who are able to see relationships between companies’ operations, earnings, and business models. Like the ancient Egyptian astronomers, these more thoughtful, knowledgeable investors areinferential —they can see that one thing logically follows another. Like the ancients, they typically develop and hone that inferential ability simply from their experiences and their repetitive behavior. Investors extrapolate frequently, since they often lack a clear idea of how to identify the factors that will make a company great and prosperous. So they take the easy route and just focus on the most recent trends in earnings or stock price. This is why the simplicity of the Seven Steps and BASM, and building on experience, will make you a real stock picker—someone who knows when and what to buy and sell for maximum profits. The first thing to know is that an incredible number of analyses and recommendations that you read about are based on extrapolating trends, even though this extrapolation looks and sounds much more sophisticated than what Grook did. This is not a path to the big money. Why? Because stocks quicklyprice-in (reflect in the price) what trends already exist, so opportunities are small when the expected trend continues. Sure, if a company is one of those few that can grow annual earnings year after year on a 20 percent annual trend, and your stock grows with it, after a decade of this each dollar you had in ([Location 1771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1771))

- It is more common than not that investors act as if the market action is telling them what to do, extrapolating either the company’s most recent earnings trends or stock trend (or both) and moving their money on that extrapolation.

- buy the trend and do not connect the points of light in the sky, or in this case the four elements of BASM. One of the central reasons for this behavior is that investors are unsure of what to look for, how to recognize the right business model when they see it, and how to recognize a great company apart from short-term earnings, good or bad, which is what this book is all about. I have found over the years that information overload has increasingly confused investors. Thus it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for most investors to pinpoint and use a few simple metrics and analytical factors that will lead to truly understanding a company. Doing that will free them from extrapolation and reliance on stock tips. Until now, that is, since the Seven Steps and BASM have worked to this end for me, and I am convinced they will do the same for you.

- I met and liked the top management and felt that they really knew what they were doing. Not only were they advancing the science of hybridization, they also understood the needs and problems of the farmers. I saw their test fields of corn and their labs, and talked to their scientists. The managers explained the economics of the sale to farmers. The big deal was that the seed cost was less than 1 percent of a farmer’s total costs of crop production. It reminded me of Schlumberger Ltd.; there was the same kind of business model. Schlumberger (SLB) was the leader in employing seismic technology (using underground sound waves) to find oil. Even though SLB’s fees for these services were very high, the expenditure represented only a tiny percentage of the total cost of finding and extracting oil. Because Schlumberger was so good at finding oil, its business with the oil companies was growing at a very fast pace. In a similar fashion, the higher costs of DeKalb’s seed would not have a material impact on a farmer’s total costs of production. I discovered that the cost of seed was not the determining factor in selling to farmers; it wastrust. Farmers, DeKalb’s managers told me, were always worried that some new, unknown seed, while promising to protect crops and create better yields, could just outright fail, or be weak in some way, since it was an unknown. Most farmers could not tolerate a ruinous year, and that ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1944))

- made them very averse to using a seed that had no track record. Executives at DeKalb told me about their research, marketing, and farmer-education programs, each of which was designed to overcome the resistance of farmers to trying new products. Management developed great products in its labs and fields, just as a computer technology company might do. Some computer companies only have good research and technology, so they have strong products but weak business models, and thus enjoy only a few successful years. DeKalb management recognized that the business model had to be built around sales, and that sales had to be built around an understanding of the farmer. This meant spending time and money to develop a strategy for building trust with their customers—the farmers. And they were succeeding. I found this out for myself when I went into town and spoke to people, particularly those who sold agricultural supplies and equipment, and stopped at a couple of farmhouses and talked to farmers. I was able to personally verify that DeKalb’s business and business model worked. We made over 400 percent on that stock, and a lot of money on the other seed stocks, so it all worked out very well. In 1982 the company merged with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to form DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=1955))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- companies that do not do well fail to meet estimates. Great companies make you a lot of money by exceeding estimates and expectations because they have characteristics unique to great companies. Poor companies drive you crazy analyzing quarterly earnings and lose you money. When a company exceeds or fails upon reporting earnings, even for a quarter, if the market thinks it is a trend, the stock moves much more than the change in earnings estimates; valuations expand or collapse, depending on what has happened. Let’s say that a stock has a bad quarter, with a 30 percent drop in earnings. Now, that’s a lot.But you understand the reasons for the short-term slide. And you still think it is a great company because of its BASM. If the stock is down 30 percent, you can buy some, and when it comes back to where it was, you are already up 43 percent. If a company is not a good company, it can drop a lot. Say a company is selling at 20X earnings and is expected to earn $1, so it sells for $20. If quarterly earnings are down by 30 percent, and the market thinks this company is going nowhere, maybe the price earnings multiple drops from 20X to only 14X. That 30 percent drop in earnings and 30 percent drop in valuation (P/E) means that the stock is now 14X an estimate of 70¢ per share, or $9.80, down a whopping 51 percent. Well, Apollo stock collapsed quickly, surprising a lot of people, and it kept going down. Conversely, great companies soar when perceptions change, and you make amazing amounts of money.

- companies will do better or fail on earnings estimates. That is how we made tons on Molex, Cisco, and Sun, and a long list of other companies (and knew when to sell many, also).

An investor usually has lots of time to get out or get in, so when the surprises come, you can already be positioned.

- This logical principle, attributed to the medieval philosopher William of Occam, underlies a great deal of all scientific modeling and theory building but does not seem to have gotten through to most investors and analysts these days. All too many analysts (though not all) and other investors are great at “reversing the razor” and using more and more information rather than focusing on a few key explanations. They sound great, but most can’t pick stocks. Studies show that adding too many variables can undermine decision-making ability. Four or five key variables are all you need to understand a company. The old adage KISS—“Keep it simple, stupid”—actually is the way to go to be a stock picker. Identifying and using a few key factors is the secret of stock picking, as long as one knows ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=2107))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- which factors. Throwing in more and more variables is not a substitute for “not knowing” which ones. That is a key reason why BASM bubbled up from my experiences. It helps you to focus and get away from the information overload. It works. The Neanderthal investors often do not identify those few key factors. They look at lots and lots of stuff—too much stuff, for sure—but then they go the natural way, which is to extrapolate results until something changes. If they do not understand the competitive strategy and business model, then they miss what is really happening and become lost in a maze of earnings reports without having a context in which to place them—the critical benchmarks of what a company should be doing to fulfill what it earlier told investors itwould do. If you do not have those business-model benchmarks to look for, you can be really late in seeing a company change, for better or worse, and as a result you probably will miss the biggest stock moves in many cases.

This to me is a surefire sell signal. If an analyst cannot give good enough answers to key questions in just a few pages of a report, writing another sixty pages is a waste.

- I have remembered two things about predicting our own lives. One was from a college professor. “When we awake in the morning, we assume that the floor is there as we get out of bed. That is one of the more ‘solid’ assumptions” he said, “but they get more ‘iffy’ after that.” Second, I always remember my disappointment and my real conviction that I had missed my one and only opportunity to say hello to Joe DiMaggio. Yet only twelve months later, I was to spend quite a long time with him, listening to some great baseball stories. Both experiences taught me a great deal about predicting the future. There is no “system” for predicting our own future, and certainly none for predicting the stock market. The assumptions we make help to define what is most probable and what is under our own control in shaping our destiny in life. The same holds true for companies.

- As you know by now, BASM is my abbreviation for business model, assumptions, strategy, and management. I am going to continue to stress this in the remaining chapters, since using it as your prime set of criteria is a great way to think about companies and their stocks, and will simplify life while making your investing better. Assumptions are the set of assumptions, or projections, about how big a market is for a company or a product, as well as the anticipated competition and demand over the next year to three years. Good management makes good assumptions, since those are what determine much of what a company tries to achieve through its strategies. The important things about BASM is that all these factors should be consistent with one another in a very commonsense way. You do not look at these things and make a decision to act instantly—you look at them and watch how a company uses them. Then you easily reach a conclusion.

- Model: a business model that is strong and shows the path to growth and profits very clearly. Momentum: a high growth rate, and one that is steady or accelerating.

- The Lesson When a company is doing exceptionally well, do not get complacent; just assure yourself that the higher the growth rate, the better the company’s engine of growth, whether it be products, or expansion geographically, or new customers. USS had a huge growth rate, but I could not find the big engine to follow on after the current product strength. Ultimately the market could not find it either. Management was at fault entirely. The top guys could not figure out what else to do. They had invented something great but were not managing the company for repeatiblity, the very thing that Microsoft, Cisco, and others had as a cornerstone of success. For instance, Johnson & Johnson, Biomet, and Medtronic were structured and managed for continuous product development; all enjoyed long-term, sustainable growth. Medtronic, the leader in cardiac pacemakers and related products, calls itself, with some justification, the leading medical-technology company in the world. Medtronic’s management understands repeatability and can execute and achieve that goal. It has performed well over decades: for the 1980s and 1990s combined, the stock multiplied shareholders’ money by roughly 100X. That is what management is all about. Management creates the big stocks by creating the products, the business plans, and the repeatability.

- Management made the difference. You could have read it all in many places even without questioning the members of the management team. As for the plan, it worked just as management had predicted. Chrysler’s people did a great job. The cars were in the showroom when expected, and the public loved them. The stock tripled in one year, went sideways for a while, then tripled again for 9X our investment. This was the reverse of selling when a new management comes in (per one of my three sell disciplines). That is because I could see that the company had already gone through its devastating fundamental fall, the stock reflected it, and now it had a very solid experienced “rescue” management—not an unknown crew—with a solid rescue plan. Another Lesson Chrysler is a wonderful example that demonstrates the key reasons why investors who concentrate on management, assumptions, strategies, and business models have the real advantage. It is those factors that make the products or services and the numbers work out. Management is often the most critical factor for you to understand. It may seem as if just concentrating on a company’s management to help you make your buy or sell decision is too easy. With technology stocks, and some other situations, the decision can be much harder. But often it is the experience and philosophy of the managers involved that can make all the difference.

- The Big Lesson A manager has to show that he can immediately identify what the real problems are in a troubled company. Only then can he put together a plan to fix things. If he has done number one expertly, then number two, the execution of the plans, will not be overly difficult. If he does not properly identify the problems, there can be no fix. Once the problem was properly identified, Gerstner showed that he could execute and immediately moved to save the customers, and the company. This is what Gerstner did. Sculley, in contrast, had created a mind-set of what he wanted to do from his successes with Pepsi, and not from understanding the personal computer industry and Apple’s place in it. One of my sell disciplines says that when a company has troubles and changes management, sell the stock. An outfit should not experiment withour money to see if it can get things right. That rule works most of the time, and certainly would have been the case with Hewlett-Packard at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

- five recessions.” This quip has become a favorite of many professionals on Wall Street. Although to those who concentrate more on the overall movements of the market indices than on individual companies and their earnings, it always looks as though a big market move “is telling them something,” in reality that is not the case. Samuelson shows that the market itself is not the forecasting tool that many people think it is. Some investors think that each drop means an impending recession, or impending doom of some kind. Most frequently that is quite wrong. Certainly this was a key factor that could make or break somebody’s investment year (or maybe many years), as you will see for yourself as I review events in 1997 and 1998, in this chapter. Having said this, I must mention that, aside from the many violent and perhaps meaningless short-term market moves, a longer-term, sustained market move can influence people’s feelings and spending behavior, and then become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, influencing changes in the economy. The so-called wealth effect means that when your house price or stock portfolio appreciates a lot in your eyes, you will spend more money (and conversely, that you will spend less in the reverse situation).

- One can wonder if the long-term worth of Dell, Yahoo, Intel, and Wal-Mart, to name a few broadly owned stocks, should have any sensitivity to events other than management decisions, the competitive environment, interest rates, and, ultimately, earnings and growth rates. The key to that question islong term. Anything can happen in the short term. ([Location 3099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3099))

- There is an old story in our business about the hippie, the priest, and the world’s smartest investor, who were passengers in a small, two-engine propeller plane. It was an excursion over a remote part of Alaska. The pilot announced that mechanical problems had developed in one engine, and he would have to shut it down, but they would be just fine on the other engine. Shortly afterward, the pilot announced that fuel line problems had developed, and the other engine was not going to last either and the passengers must use the parachutes in the back, before the plane crashed. Unfortunately, somebody had made an error, and there were only two chutes for the three passengers. As they looked at one another in horror, with ashen faces and trembling voices, the priest said, “I am the only one who can take care of my parish in a remote part of the West, where many ([Location 3146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3146))

- families totally rely on me for help and guidance.” The investor said, “I am the world’s smartest investor. I cannot just die like this.” Finally, the hippie said, “I want to live; I don’t want to go down with this plane.” The world’s smartest investor did not wait for more. He grabbed one of the parachutes and jerked the door open with one swift motion, yelling “Geronimo!” as he leaped from the plane. As the priest looked at the hippie with fear on his face, the hippie smiled and said, “Do not be afraid, Father. We still have two chutes. The world’s smartest investor just jumped out of the plane with my knapsack.” Many of us in the investment world enjoy this little joke because we know how easy it is for so-called smart people to outsmart themselves. We further understand that investment success is not an IQ contest, and that paying attention to many things, while being somewhat humble in deference to how tough it is to predict the future, is healthy, to say the least.

- Know what you own. So, if you thought you had stocks that could multiply your money by 5X or 10X or perhaps even some really great opportunities that could develop into a Cisco, a Wal-Mart, or others that mean over 100X your money, would you be timing the market? Here are the key things that lead to emotional timing by individuals: Lack of confidence in the stocks you own. Troubling markets test you on this. Investing money you might soon need for other important things. Getting a bit greedy and taking more risk than is appropriate for your financial profile or your personality. Lack of patience—taking a short time horizon instead of several years. A desire to gamble or a belief that you actually can time the market.

- The lessons from this recent bubble are important for three reasons. First, there is the unlikely possibility that we may encounter another stock market bubble in our investing lifetime. One per lifetime seems the “rule,” but we cannot rule out anything completely. Second, we do have small bubbles in the market (smaller than in 1929 and 2000 is how I define this myself) periodically. These include the one caused by a mania in blue chips (called the “Nifty Fifty”) from the late 1960s into early 1973, a moderate technology ([Location 3308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3308))

- stock bubble in 1983, and the overvaluation in the market before the 1987 stock market “crash.” Third and most important, bubbles occur inindividual stocks fairly frequently. We have all heard the termbubble and also the termmania used over the past few years very, very frequently—when people have talked about possible bubbles in real estate or housing, in financial instruments in foreign countries, and at times even in the Chinese economy, which has had some startling growth numbers that are far above anything seen before. Bubbles, like those from bubble gum or soap, come in all different sizes, but they all have one thing in common with each other, including the gum and the soap bubbles: they are going to burst.They are unsustainable because they are not built on enough real substance to support themselves. Thus, many bubbles develop from a mania. A mania is simply something that is more emotional than tangible or rational, so it can be thought of as irrationality. The irrationality that leads to the inflating in price beyond what complete knowledge and good analysis would suggest can be the result of one thing or of two or more things in combination. The irrationality itself is not very easy to see at the beginning, since there would be no bubble if it were… ([Location 3312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3312))

It can even be Krispy Kreme Doughnuts—not all that mysterious or technological, but driven by perceptions, desires, and emotions. Perceptions, not analysis, drove this stock to ridiculous levels and then that bubble popped. Bubble lessons never go out of style, and not only are going to help you with big bubbles, or individual stock bubbles, but will focus you on which information is real and what is perception in almost all of your investing. Learn the lessons well. With bubbles, there is an element of mystery. To cope with that, start with the first of the Seven Steps, knowledge, and combine that with BASM, since in a bubble it is likely that the beliefs of the crowd cannot be supported by real knowledge. With a well-defined BASM, this can be clearly understood. A considerable number of people (but not all) in the investment community regarded a wide range of technology, communications, and Internet stocks as having almost unlimited demand for their products and unlimited potential—all of which assumptions proved to be incorrect. Yet the entire crowd thought in this way about many… ([Location 3324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3324))

- built upon fraud or swindles. This is not how I see the 2000 Internet bubble, even though the atmosphere of greed it created did bring out the worst in a number of executives who engaged in what proved to be criminal behavior, either outright stealing from their companies (as executives of Tyco International and Adelphia Communications did), or engaging in accounting and financial fraud (which is what Bernie Ebbers, WorldCom’s chairman was convicted of in March 2005.) Personally, I think there were three bubbles that burst in 2000, and they were all related to one another. The first was the most obvious: the stock market bubble, which had component bubbles in Internet, telecommunications, and various technology stocks. The excitement over those took almost all other stocks into overvaluation. The second was the bubble in capital spending by corporations in the great telecommunications build-out that was going to accommodate all the new traffic, create broadband access for most businesses and consumers, and handle all the new uses of the Internet. The same beliefs that caused stocks to soar were also driving this corporate capital spending, since the new information about the potential of all sorts of technologies appeared to offer… ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3335))

- When Bill Gates quit college at Harvard University, it was because he had a burning desire to get into the brand-new computer industry before it was too late. He foresaw that being first or at least early was critical. Perhaps the most important reason in Gates’s mind was that the customers for computers would want software to carry out powerful functions for them, but they would want software built around standards. That meant with uniformity and continuity, so a businessperson or consumer would not learn something only to have a better technology come along—perhaps from a different company—and require an entirely new learning process. Gates realized this would be a giant handicap that could deter the blossoming and growth of the industry, and it had to be avoided by the early birds, who would establish dominance and ([Location 3630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3630))

- standards. He desperately wanted to be the early bird. The big assumption that drove it all was the assumption that customers would have a critical need for standards, and they would stay with one company’s products cycle after cycle if those products met their needs and were competitive in new technologies. Assumption number two was that the standards would be set by those early companies—perhaps only one company. Therefore those standards had to dominate early. Assumption number three was that the technology had to be either the best, at the very beginning, or close to the best, and customers had to believe this. Assumption number four was built on the knowledge that it is very tough for any one company to always have the best technology, product after product, year after year. So management assumed that once a company came to dominate the industry by becoming the standard, each new product only had to becompetitive. It did not have to be the absolute best, for customers were not going to walk away from the standards they wanted. Yes, the organization would strive to be the best at all times, but a great strategy was critical to maintaining leadership. Setting standards and achieving early domination flowed from those assumptions as the core company strategy was formulated at the beginning, in the mid- to late 1970s, long before Microsoft had products in the market and was ready to go public. We understood in that very first meeting with Gates in 1986 that he had not simply been ([Location 3635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3635))

- pursuing the computer market with good technology. Had he done that, he would have been prominent in the high-tech race and maybe even had the best products for a while. But he would not have had a strategy that locked in customers, created repeatability in product cycles and results, and made Microsoft the long-distance runner it became. This is in stark contrast to the vast majority of high-tech companies that are hot for a few years, then give way to others. The best of those companies may multiply their investors’ money 3X, 5X, or more, but they are not the big-money stocks, since they do not have repeatability for the long run. It was clear from what I read and what I heard that day that the operating systems of computers like DOS (and later Windows—embedded in the computer so that the computer can understand and run applications programs) were the first standard. Then came the individual applications programs (like spreadsheets and word processing). They would all coordinate with that standard operating system, so that customers would never have to fear being forced to hop around among vendors to get what they wanted. The strategy, then, was to capture as much market share as early as possible, no matter what. Profits were not the highest priority in this original strategy, which was different from that of most other companies. Market share and market dominance were the goals and strategy, and the business model was built to accomplish this. Thus, management—Bill Gates and other key people, such as his friend and company cofounder, Paul Allen—developed tools for computer programmers at the beginning, so that they would be accepted by those who wrote software for the industry. This was a way of pursuing a goal of controlling as much intellectual property as possible. Next Microsoft knew that to have a standard operating system from which it could write and sell standard applications to do word processing and more, it would have to be accepted by the big computer manufacturers. The biggest was IBM, which totally dominated the industry in the early phase of PCs’ going mainstream. At the very beginning, there were some exciting early success stories of small PC companies, and they had excellent technology. Yet none of them actually had good enough business models and strategies to fend off… ([Location 3646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY11LU&location=3646))
