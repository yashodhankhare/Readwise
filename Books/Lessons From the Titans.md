## Highlights
- In the decades after World War I, the average age of a company in the S&P 500 was 60 years. Today, it’s less than 20 years and projected to decline every year for the next decade. Some of these companies disappeared because they were acquired; some just flat-out died. Either way, the common thread is a failure to sustain the excellence that got them into the S&P 500 in the first place. So why can’t large, wealthy organizations maintain their competitive advantages? The most common explanation by the pundits is disruption, which is exceedingly hard to predict and most likely a convenient excuse. The reality is more complex and humbling. Companies usually fail because of the incompetence and arrogance of a complacent management team, not because they struggled to predict the future.

- As veteran analysts, we’ve had a front row seat for the market’s two-decade-old obsession with disruption, digital transformation, market dominance, and cultish leadership. But as the era of the “new economy” shows early signs of maturation, the question becomes, What companies will endure and continue to grow—and how? The answer comes from an unlikely place: the big industrial companies that have chugged along successfully, many of them for decades. They are the market’s original tech sector. (See Figure I.1.) They were once young high-flyers, not much different from many of the tech ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=191))

- wonders of today. Each was spawned in some manner from a singular disruption, the dream of an entrepreneur, or some other key competitive advantage. GE goes back to the inventions of Thomas Edison, Boeing to the origins of flight, Honeywell to the thermostat, and Stanley Black & Decker to hardware starting in the 1840s. But after that disruption phase, each of these companies was tested in ways their founders never imagined. High profits always attract new entrants, and perversely those entrants are often advantaged by the ability to copy others’ successes, all with the benefits a clean sheet of paper and fresh capital can offer. More important, each of these companies had to survive periods of poor leadership, grandiose visions, and the inevitable loss of focus that infects an organization when systems and processes are not encouraged.

- Most of the failures in American business are subtle. The companies merely fade away, usually merged into a bigger entity that is happy to take on an installed base, customer list, some technology, and talent—all for a fire sale price. These companies don’t get categorized as failures in an absolute sense. In fact, the executives normally walk away richer and are celebrated. But without that sale or merger, their future was heavily in doubt. They count into the thousands, just in the industrial sector alone. And while we have looked at more than a hundred years of data, we realized that we didn’t have to go back that far. The reasons for failure and the formulas for success haven’t really changed at all. Whether it be 1950, 1980, or 2020, they are pretty much exactly the same. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=215))

- actions and incentives, not a driver. Said a different way, it can’t be force-fed from the top. It’s not about words—it’s about actions. Most companies that talk about culture don’t have one, at least not a good one. Culture doesn’t come from a mission statement or a CEO’s webcasted lecture. Culture is encouraged from the top but is actually built from the bottom—on the factory floor or in the cubicles where the actual work gets done.

- We’re especially impressed with the power of compounding—even 1 to 2 percent annual improvements add up. A steady improvement in the efficiency of operations provides rising cash to invest in future growth, which in turn can raise the returns on your operations further. It’s a virtuous cycle that gives companies the flexibility to pivot around disruption or any other challenge—the “flywheel effect”—the term that Jim Collins successfully promoted with his excellent work in the 2001 bestselling book Good to Great.

- In any event, we have little choice but to define success by financial metrics, and we’ve found that stock market returns over time correlate higher to survival than any other metric. In the long run, the stock market is a fair referee. Capital flows to value-creating entities and drains from value destroyers. In the short term there is hype and speculation, but in the long term the correlation between enterprise success and stock market returns is high.

- Until a better measure is found, shareholder value and its hypercorrelation to survival will reign as our metric of choice. We don’t ignore other stakeholders, and in fact at times we’ll emphasize the importance of one over others, but only when it’s crucial. The successes of key stakeholder groups are not mutually exclusive. The reality is that companies that find long-term success nearly always focus intensely on customer needs, treat suppliers as partners, consider employees as their biggest asset, and invest in their communities. We find little evidence to the contrary. But shareholder value must be ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=303))

- All good things take time. In fact, the companies we highlight in this book required up to seven years to fully execute their strategy. Any business plan that has teeth will require consistent focus, and that’s probably the hardest part. Sticking with a strategy through the ups and downs of a business cycle while also dealing with the “whack-a-mole” daily distractions requires tremendous focus.

- Welch exited slower-growth, more competitive businesses like mining and replaced them with higher-growth, often higher-tech areas such as specialty plastics. He wanted businesses with the potential for concentrated market share. His motto became “Fix it, close it, or sell it.” To win the organization over to his agenda, Welch beefed up rewards, with stock options his preferred currency, and encouraged risk taking. Those who missed their numbers went on probation and were fired if they fell short again. Those who met or exceeded the numbers saw a sizable pay bump and a faster career track. For the rest of the organization, he instituted forced ranking, with the bottom 10 percent of employees let go each year. By 1986 the company had fired over 100,000 employees, a quarter of the workforce, and despite the warnings of critics, revenues actually grew through this turmoil. No restructuring of this scale had ever been done in American ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=428))

- Not surprisingly, GE became a cutthroat, almost manic organization where paranoia reigned. Management embraced a “work hard/play hard” culture, as employees were given increasingly difficult projects with higher and higher expectations. If you succeeded, you were moved to a different job, usually in a different region, every two to three years. It was a hard life, and families paid the price; executive divorce rates were high. But financial results were outsized, and GE’s reputation for exceptional management was growing. GE’s stock price nearly doubled during this five-year time frame (up 180 percent), far outpacing the S&P 500 (up 80 percent).

- Welch saw an RCA that had valuable assets that he could monetize more easily than perceived. His plan was to break up the company and keep the pieces that he really wanted, notably the NBC television network. In the end, he sold all the noncore assets for a total that exceeded the purchase price, and he left himself the crown jewel, NBC, essentially for free. It was a brilliant move—and an unheard of M&A strategy at the time. Only then did Wall Street see Welch as a complete leader overall, credibility that took seven years to build. This shift in his image occurred only after massive operational fixes, the selling of low-growth assets, and a game-changing acquisition. The history books miss one critical component of GE’s success in that time period. By the mid- to late 1980s, GE was becoming a cash flow machine. Welch taught managers to fixate on every detail. From the productivity of the factories to every contract term, they emphasized cash flow. And that cash flow allowed for five large bets on future growth: (1) air travel, (2) gas-powered electricity generation, (3) global healthcare expansion, (4) television advertising, and (5) ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=455))

- financial services. These areas of focus would lead GE to another 15 years of unprecedented growth and success, cementing Welch’s reputation as a visionary and helping catapult GE stock to an eye-popping 3,100 percent gain during his tenure. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=463))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The deals themselves took GE to a different level, but the equal hero here was the operational and management discipline. People forget at times, but Welch was a roll-up-your-sleeves operating guy. His operating reviews were intense. He wanted detail and precision. He had no patience for those who couldn’t keep pace. And it was the strength of his operations that gave him the cash, the confidence, and the support of his board to make some pretty big bets on the future. With all these bets paying off, the 1990s were immensely profitable for GE. Other industrial companies struggled to remain relevant in the new economy of the internet, and yet GE found ways to capture headlines. In the emerging cult of the CEO, Welch became the archetype celebrity leader. He and his senior team also became immensely wealthy. All that success led to a dangerous level of arrogance, which was beginning to show by the late 1990s. And perhaps this is where the GE story began to fray. After two decades of exceptional returns, GE’s culture began to lose focus on what had gotten it to this point in the first place. The company began to revert to its bureaucratic beginnings, ignore its factories, and go after increasingly larger and riskier deals, all with more debt leverage and the help of opaque accounting. Ironically, the triumphant Welch era ended with an apparent setback: the failed attempt to buy Honeywell in 2000. In a battle of big egos, the European Union rejected the $45 billion acquisition. GE’s aggressive public comments and its premature moving of staff into Honeywell headquarters didn’t help. Mario Monte, then head of the EU’s Competition Commission, may have blocked the merger as much for political as substantive reasons. His decision was later overturned, but it was too late: GE dropped the deal. Whether that deal would have been good or bad for GE, we will never know. But megadeals done in the final innings of a CEO’s tenure seem to rarely work. Ego and arrogance appear to play a big role in the outcome. Welch’s final years were far from his best, maybe even downright destructive, but the value creation over time had already cemented his legacy, perhaps overshadowing a company that ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=577))

- was beginning to slip. The celebrity that began to follow him served as a distraction for a CEO and an organization that had otherwise remained focused for the better part of two decades. Welch’s final move was selecting his successor, a fateful decision that has historians now questioning much of Welch’s legacy in its entirety. While Welch remained quiet during most of GE’s eventual decline, he would later admit that he was “deceived”—a comment that offers little solace to those who suffered from the largest destruction of shareholder value in American history. Sadly, Jack Welch passed away in March 2020, before he had a chance to comment on this manuscript. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=593))

- Enthralled by the future, Immelt didn’t want short-term problems or criticisms to get in the way, and so he doubled down on an unfortunate legacy of Welch: earnings management. In the late 1980s, as GE Capital began its expansion, Welch had discovered that financial services offered a lot of discretion in declaring gains and losses. When GE’s core businesses had slow quarters, he could balance them out with strong results from Capital and vice versa. Welch’s earnings management became famous, even applauded, despite the clear ethical lapses guaranteed to occur with such discretion. Immelt continued and possibly even expanded the practice. After multiple years of crisis that have now defined his legacy, this earnings management arguably crossed well into the unethical. To win at this earnings game, GE cut back on disclosures—details that analysts relied on in ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=672))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Adding to the difficulty, Immelt reinforced Welch’s “Don’t question us” mentality. While we celebrate many of Welch’s accomplishments, the darker reality included the fact that Welch had built a fortress around GE. Outsiders were viewed with disdain. The arrogance and insularity grew with Welch’s public celebrity. The intimidation factor was massive. And though Immelt softened Welch’s harder line on outside criticism, he largely looked the other way when subordinates carried on the practice. At GE, protecting Immelt’s image and the company itself became more important than any ethical consideration. As a GE analyst, I knew that the power of GE put my job at constant risk. If the company blacklisted me, I might never find work again. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=697))

- GE’s talented, relentless investor relations (IR) team had no interest in letting analysts challenge its public narrative. The scare tactics had few boundaries. In 2003, I gave the company the courtesy of seeing a draft of a report I wrote that criticized parts of GE Capital and compared its rising risk profile directly with that of banks, notably Citigroup. Sending drafts was a common practice back then to speed up fact-checking. Shortly thereafter, on a summer Sunday afternoon, I got a call on my cell phone. It was a member of GE’s IR team. The substance of the call was a demand that I drop the report altogether. If not, the team would use all its power to squash my credibility, including leveraging CNBC anchors (GE owned CNBC within its NBC unit) to attack my findings. The caller also raised the possibility that GE management would elevate its dissatisfaction with me all the way to the top of Morgan Stanley’s executive team. I was reminded in that call that Immelt knew all the bank CEOs, having most on speed dial. Morgan Stanley, to its credit, allowed publication, but only after I had a lengthy back-and-forth ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=702))

- forth over multiple days with internal lawyers and managers, who softened the findings in the report. One of the quieter ways that GE would go after an analyst’s credibility would be to question the relevance of the findings and question the quality. If you’re managing an equity research department on Wall Street, it’s hard to know what action to take when a company calls and says the report quality is low and misrepresents the truth. The “truth” often takes substantial time to surface, and relevance is highly subjective. It’s usually just safer to soften the report and move on, which is exactly what GE wanted and almost always achieved. GE’s threats always included some comment about the company’s relationship with the firm’s investment bankers. After all, for investment bankers, GE’s size, debt issuance, and dealmaking made it a virtual ATM machine. An analyst could only get in the way of a never-ending… ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=711))

- exactly that. In those days, that level of harassment was still allowed, and research had limited power in the organization. I tried to shake it off, but GE’s tactics certainly affected my work. It’s hard to stay firm when punched in the face so frequently and violently. At some point you start to give in. By 2004, I upgraded GE stock to a buy rating on a view that margins were set to inflect upward. That served to lessen the harassment for sure. I even got a holiday card from Immelt that said, “I have 19 percent op rate [operating margins] tattooed on my ass.” That margin never happened, and the stock call was dead wrong. Several journalists at major financial publications have shared with me similar stories of GE’s pressure over the years. This was particularly true of the Wall Street Journal, which always put top talent on the GE beat, usually the kind of reporters that GE did not want—the kind… ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=719))

- of his astonishment at GE’s violent response to a critical report that he wrote on Immelt. He said that GE’s response was the most aggressive that he had ever experienced in his very long career in journalism. All of this ties back to the celebrity status that Welch passed down to his successor. As we know from Welch’s divorce proceedings in 2002, even in his retirement, he enjoyed outrageous perks like continued access to GE’s oversized fleet of aircraft. Immelt, for his part, embraced the perks with similar enthusiasm. The airplane fiasco reported by the Wall Street Journal in 2017, where a backup jet followed him on business trips in case the main jet had problems, exposed just a small piece of the excess. In selling NBC in 2009, for example, he had an entire golf course shut down so he and Brian Roberts of Comcast could negotiate in private while playing. Roberts viewed that as highly… ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=728))

Any effort to do so was in the context of “keeping enemies close.” In fact, on one particular occasion, he invited me to be a guest of his at the annual College Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony, an organization that he was president of at the time. Sometime before dinner he introduced me to the head of the NCAA, Mark Emmert, as “the most dangerous man on Wall Street.” A joke perhaps, but the tone bordered on malicious, and when I laughed, he only glared back, then walked away. It was clear that he feared anyone who could derail his vision, despite the fact that analysts’ influence at that time was at a low point, and GE was… ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=736))

- There’s nothing that destroys a culture faster than wasteful spending and celebrity behavior among the executives. Every example of corporate failure we know about included exactly that. What employees see, they start emulating. Customers and suppliers eventually see as well, and the brand suffers. By 2004, with profits no longer keeping pace with those of GE’s peers, Immelt worked hard to keep up a positive appearance. Besides buying aggressively and expanding Capital, the company issued earnings reports full of one-time gains and buried restructuring expenses. Losses typically went “below the line” in areas ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=812))

- such as discontinued operations. The reality of an asset became secondary to how it could be presented. I asked Immelt in 2005 why he didn’t sell NBC Universal (NBCU), still valued at a solid $50 billion, even as it was coming under pressure from declining ratings. He said if the unit wasn’t worth more than $70 billion in three years, then he should be fired. In fact, he sold NBCU to Comcast in 2009, four years later, for all of $30 billion. Then Comcast managed to double NBCU’s earnings three years later. Even with all the competition out there, NBCU under a different owner is likely worth upward of $100 billion. The context is astounding. NBCU, which equated to less than 20 percent of GE’s earnings in most years prior to its sale, is now worth about all of what remains at GE combined. GE sold at the absolute bottom, leaving billions on the table. When I later brought up that conversation to Immelt in front of a small group of investors at an annual industry conference, he asked me, “When did you become such an asshole?” ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=817))

- An analysis of a half century of aircraft development programs suggests that bets on new aircraft pay off and make money only half of the time. The other half of the time, poor sales, low production volume, or technical problems and delays lead to significant losses. As a result, until 2010, the industry hadn’t consistently generated acceptable levels of profitability. We estimate that from 1970 to 2010, Boeing generated a paltry average profit margin of just over 5 percent in the airplane business. This historical mediocrity in returns is largely the result of poorly conceived airplane programs dragging down otherwise good ones. An airplane program is a monumental engineering and manufacturing challenge. Engineers design 500,000-pound pieces of equipment that can fly through the sky at 500 miles per hour, and line workers assemble them at a pace as fast as one new plane per day. Organizations of hundreds of thousands of people invest millions of hours and billions of dollars in bringing a new plane to market. At any given time, an aircraft manufacturer only has the organizational bandwidth to produce a few distinct product lines at reasonable volumes. This makes the mix of money-makers versus money-losers incredibly influential to the company’s overall level of profitability. For almost the entirety of Boeing’s history in the commercial jet business, it had both good and bad programs, due to a culture that focused more on engineering than profitable business.

- In early 2020, Danaher was nearing $20 billion in revenues with a market value of $115 billion. Instead of declining into bloated maturity, it built an immensely profitable set of businesses that sell into some of the highest-growth niches in healthcare and water testing/treatment. And although its global franchises employ 60,000 people, with sharp employment growth over time, head count in Washington, DC, headquarters isn’t much larger than it was decades ago, still just about 100 people.

- The story of Danaher is first and foremost one of constant reinvention. It has fully exited nearly all its initial industrial assets and even spun off its dental platform—a testament to its leaders’ determination to gravitate capital toward higher-return opportunities while fading those in the maturity curve. In the process it created several valuable “mini-Danahers,” notably Fortive ($25 billion market cap), which houses Danaher’s original industrial assets, and Envista ($5 billion market cap), which has the dental assets.

- Not only is Danaher willing to become smaller to refocus its portfolio, but once it believes that an asset no longer fits in its long-term plans, it finds a better owner for it—even if the asset is still growing and creating value.

- Business System (DBS) extraordinarily well. Perhaps what’s less understood is how central the Danaher Business System has been to this reinvention. In simple terms, DBS is a set of constantly updated best practices that functions as a playbook for all employees. It provides day-to-day structure, with clear definitions of what matters and how it will be measured. The tools keep employees focused, but less on a specific goal line and more on continuous improvement, people measuring what matters and improving on those metrics a little bit every single day. At its core DBS comes from Lean manufacturing, and it extends from the factory into all other critical functions, including sales/marketing, procurement, and engineering, up into the corporate office and R&D labs. DBS defines the culture of Danaher. Its excellence is best illustrated… ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1564))

DBS pushes the organization out of its comfort zone. Employees are empowered to achieve autonomously, equipped with mandatory tools. Lean manufacturing becomes a religion to follow. Wasteful processes are tossed aside. Expectations rise. Those who embrace this rigorous culture thrive; others are filtered out. The metrics are clear, with no place to hide. The end result is a stock price that continues to rise, an energized and cared-for employee base, products that increasingly solve some of the most important problems in healthcare, and value for all stakeholders that ranks near the top… ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1571))

They assembled their first-ever meeting of all Danaher executives and had Koenigsaecker present a full business case for the new principles. Thus, the Danaher Production System was born, the predecessor to the more evolved and broader Danaher Business System. Its basic principles, rooted in Lean and continuous improvement, are fundamentally unchanged today. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1617))

That performance is all the more impressive given how the technology world took over global stock markets and that Danaher’s assets were plain vanilla industrial. Much of Culp’s success can be traced to three important initiatives: (1) He worked with the board on a portfolio of businesses that exploited all the powers of DBS. (2) Unlike leaders who prefer to hire those who aren’t a threat, he increased the organization’s focus on talent and surrounded himself with people who would keep up with his fast pace. (3) He pushed DBS deeper into the organization. He and his colleagues developed an expanded toolkit touching every facet of the company.

- was it getting harder to land the best deals, but shareholders preferred a steadier acquisition stream. The company found that Lean manufacturing, and productivity in general, worked best in companies with steady growth, neither high nor low. As Jack Welch at GE realized in his early days with Six Sigma, the ideal unit volume growth cadence for rising productivity is somewhere between 4 and 6 percent. A higher rate can work but requires putting a lot more capital in place, often at a lower return. At its best, Lean and other productivity tools allow a company to add 2 to 3 percent of manufacturing capacity without adding equipment, people, or footprint—it’s “free” capacity. With intensive, but not usually that expensive, up-front training to implement Lean, a growing manufacturer can therefore supply 2 to 3 percent more revenue with limited extra cost. The result is a higher ROI on the factory assets. With a… ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1702))

- Above that 4–6 percent growth range, you lose many of the benefits of Lean, as overtime wages are often required and supply chain partners struggle to keep pace. You make suboptimal decisions just to get goods out the door. Slow or negative growth that comes with a recession becomes even more problematic. If you resort to layoffs to offset the weaker demand, then you’re dismissing people trained in Lean and immersed in your culture—which will mightily discourage remaining employees from adopting the best practices so needed to get there in the first place. Under those conditions, with two otherwise identical businesses, buying the highly cyclical company is going to generate less value for Danaher than the steadier, less cyclical one. Nothing was more frustrating to Culp than getting a company fully ramped up on Lean, only to see a recession unwind so much of the hard work, so he pushed for a change… ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1711))

- the equipment running. For Danaher, the up-front hardware could be a tad cyclical as long as the aftermarket consumables were steady. The deals under Culp’s tenure included Videojet (industrial printers that needed ink), Radiometer (imaging equipment), Vision Systems (medical instruments), ChemTreat (water treatment), AB Sciex (measurement equipment), and Beckman Coulter (testing equipment). These assets were a bit more expensive than the traditional cyclical deal book, but Culp took on low-cost debt as an offset—not just from lower interest rates, but from the rating agencies’ realization that Danaher was a cash flow machine. Another benefit from reducing cyclicality was that the market was willing to pay a premium for a Danaher stock with less variability. Culp saw that trend early—and got the Rales brothers and the board to agree to a strategy of paying more for the right kind of assets. This shift in acquisition strategy generated enormous value, particularly since the new assets worked so well with Lean. Most corporate buyers fixate on either higher-growth game-changing transactions or deals that serve to consolidate their markets. But Culp went after solid assets—healthcare, dental, and testing equipment firms that often flew a bit under the radar—not high growth, and often very niche, which meant they didn’t fit well with other strategic buyers. He also avoided low-growth businesses, however attractive the price, as the benefits of DBS would largely be wasted. Separately Culp came to understand that DBS worked better with businesses with a high gross margin, especially those with a big spread between gross and operating margins.

The portfolio suddenly seemed out of step with a market that was moving toward either very high-growth technology stories or more stable and focused pure plays. To deal with the portfolio problem, the board and the new CEO decided to split the company into two. The vision was that Danaher proper kept the businesses that had razor/razorblade characteristics, those connected to healthcare, water, and product ID (printing). The other, more conventionally industrial assets were spun off into a new holding company, dubbed Fortive. Shareholders were surprised but quickly became comfortable with the move, or at least comfortable with the leadership and the cultures that defined these organizations.

Just four were financial: organic growth, margins, cash flow, and ROIC. Another two of the metrics related to the customer experience: on-time delivery and quality measured by defects/million.

- continuous improvement sounds easy, it is quite hard to execute. It’s a journey, not a destination, and most cultures look for explicit goal lines. The result is that people focus on that goal line, rather than continuous improvement itself, and once that goal is achieved, the improvement stops. Most Lean-based companies have starts and stops and struggle to maintain focus, particularly through management changes and cyclical dynamics. Business gets hard, and Lean falls by the wayside. Business gets good again, and Lean is thrown out for risk of missing a customer order. There are always excuses. It is so much harder than it seems. We’ve seen Danaher’s approach up close and personal for many years, with tours of its factories around the world, countless meetings with management, and hundreds of hours analyzing financials. We kept looking for holes in the story. But over and over in our meetings with Danaher employees the consistency of answers to our questions is impressive. DBS is real.

Danaher says it is a shameless adopter of others’ best practices, because DBS isn’t good enough, never will be good enough, and will always have to change. We just can’t think of another company that exhibits that level of paranoia after such a track record of success or that shows such a willingness to experiment, tweak, and rapidly change. Of course, those experiments often fail, and that willingness to risk failure to change is the point. Truly exceptional people and cultures seem to understand that reinvention is critical in order to continue to thrive. At Danaher, DBS drives constant change and nurtures a culture that embraces such change. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1856))

- Danaher is one of the more time-intensive HR organizations we’ve ever seen, all because it believes bad managers have a terrible impact that can last long after they are gone. On the positive side, the efforts and willingness to get rid of bad managers, even those with strong near-term results, will result in building culture. Employees see accountability at the highest levels, and that matters. All that accountability, though, requires time, with lots of on-site visits and discussions with all levels of staff. Another HR differentiator is onboarding. Danaher’s new hires (above a certain organizational level) go through a two to three-month immersion program during which they are not yet allowed to do their jobs. Instead they visit factories and facilities, sit in meetings unrelated to their role, and learn DBS and its tools. The company fully integrates them into the system without distraction. This time investment is unique and tells recruits from day one that Danaher is interested ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=1920))

Its intensity leads some to discover that “this company just isn’t for me.” For HR, exiting someone quickly who doesn’t embrace DBS is a victory. This unusually high investment in HR pays off in developing leaders who deliver exceptional results without the common breakdowns in integrity we often see in peers. Danaher is known for factory excellence, but having good people in place, with a strong culture to guide them, is what maintains this excellence over time.

- Next, we want to emphasize the power of compounding. At Danaher, it’s multidimensional. Compounding via pure operations creates increments of productivity that add up over time: processes that can add low-cost capacity to factories just by making small process improvements and freeing up factory space, while helping employees get a little bit better at their jobs every day. Compounding via financial engineering is powerful as well—doing smart deals, bringing acquisitions into the culture successfully, improving the asset, and paying off the associated debt. This all creates a powerful flywheel effect. Compounding via DBS—making the business system itself better over time by incorporating tools learned from others, while constantly modernizing the core tenets, is foundational to Danaher’s success. Last, we focus on the leaders in the story—the Rales brothers, Sherman, Culp, Allender, Joyce, Comas, Lico—because they (and their staffs of increasingly diverse reports) are exceptional. Game changers, they are worth studying. Some of them continue to build their résumés: Culp may be in the middle of the biggest turnaround in American history, with GE. Joyce may end up building the largest biotech enabler. Lico is still in the early innings of a 10-year business plan (yes, we said “10 year”) that might take us to places we couldn’t even imagine. Make no mistake—each of these folks will hold a place in American business history. We’ve recommended Danaher stock to our clients for about 15 years but not without some second thoughts at times. Successful companies that are willing to “blow it up” are rare, and there have been questionable moments: an industrial company that decides to become a healthcare company just when industrial companies are cheap and healthcare is not; a spun-off asset in Fortive that itself has announced a major spin-off of its transportation assets. And acquisitions that sometimes challenge even the most forward-thinking analyst. It all seems a bit too unorthodox.

- wild ride, full of bold decisions and pivots, but transformational change anchored in a solid system. Change before you expect it is probably a good thing. In fact, a strong culture may drive that change. And the opposite of success through reinvention may just be failure through stagnation. In the meantime, watch for Danaher and Fortive to operate with the mindset of “common sense vigorously applied.” Because with all the complexity that the Danaher story seems to introduce, the truth is pretty basic: DBS is simple. At its core, it’s just a set of tools that remind people what to do: To stay focused on what matters. To use visual tools. To keep meetings short and focused and email only what’s necessary. To manage the little details. To measure what matters and improve on those measurements by doing a little every day versus taking big leaps in spurts. To benchmark to the best and be willing to accept the realities that others are getting better too. To hire humble and transparent folks. To develop internal talent so that when you get promoted, someone is ready to take your role. And to get rid of those who don’t live those principles.

- The modern Honeywell story began on February 19, 2002, the start date of an unlikely corporate savior: CEO Dave Cote (pronounced “Cody”). He led a turnaround against tremendous odds—a broken company trying to survive an economic downturn with an unproven, unconventional CEO. Honeywell was challenged in almost every dimension: poor operations, lousy products, asbestos liabilities, a dysfunctional culture, and more. It needed cash to upgrade factories, invest in R&D, and expand into emerging markets, as well as satisfy debt holders by managing its potentially exploding set of liabilities. By the end of 2002, there had already been 78 companies bankrupted by overwhelming asbestos liabilities, including big Honeywell competitors like Federal Mogul and W. R. Grace. That alone brought the company into crisis mode, but it was hardly the only issue Cote inherited. Environmental liabilities were piling up as well, with the cities of Baltimore and Buffalo demanding massive water cleanups that could ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2033))

- Eventually the job went to David Cote, a far less noteworthy GE alumnus who gained little attention running GE’s appliance business, after which he had a brief and unremarkable tenure running another conglomerate, TRW. He was reportedly the board’s fifth choice, and word that the board was forced to settle for a “second-tier” leader quickly leaked out. Wall Street saw Cote as such a weak selection that a CNBC commentator proclaimed: “Honeywell is probably not fixable, and if it is, it’s probably not fixable by Dave Cote.” ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2099))

He liked to ride his motorcycle on weekends and smoke cigars. Years later, he visited my home for an event I was hosting and introduced himself to my wife by saying, “Hi, I’m Dave. I run Honeywell.” She walked over to me and said, “I think he picked up his jeans from the floor, where he left them the night before.” He hardly looked the part of the game-changing leader of a critical American company. If you could get past his appearance and the wilted look, however, Cote’s speech at EPG showed a clear strategy. He was working an early turnaround playbook, which meant stabilizing existing operations, bringing in outside talent where needed, making long-term investments, and taking the inevitable short-term criticism. He was playing defense, buying time for the turnaround. The stock kept lagging that of peers for the ([Location 2145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2145))

What began as a 2003 forward-earnings forecast of $2.00 per share by the Street was on its way to a low-quality $1.54, even as peers were showing better numbers and higher-quality results in a stabilizing economy. I had just been promoted to run Morgan Stanley’s industrial research group. Perhaps naïvely, I liked what he said and how he said it, and I especially liked that no one else liked it. Cote spoke my language, as I was a Wall Street outsider myself. I had grown up in numerous factory towns and didn’t have an Ivy League résumé. My only asset was my willingness to work hard and tolerate the pain that goes along with long hours and intense work pressures. In college, Cote worked the night shift at a GE aircraft engine factory to cover tuition and support his new family. By the time he graduated and had his first salaried job, he took nothing for granted and worked maniacally, struggling through two marriages in the process.

- As the world recovered from the 2001–2002 recession, Honeywell’s improved operations and revived morale started to translate into higher margins and greater cash flow. Wall Street’s reluctance to accept Cote began to turn, but only slightly, as the company’s liabilities remained: an underfunded pension, asbestos liabilities, and a big environmental cleanup bill. All were sins of the past, mostly decades prior, but had to be fixed. Cote needed a credible finance chief who could manage the mess. Enter Dave Anderson, who became CFO in June 2003. Anderson is the polar opposite of Cote: a polished, well-dressed executive who favors healthy food and fine wine and is more likely to have sparkling water than a can of Coke or Mountain Dew that Cote preferred. A fitness enthusiast who runs six miles before most people hit the snooze button, with an MBA from the University of Chicago, he ([Location 2181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2181))

And though polished, Anderson had the work ethic of someone who came from humble beginnings: a small town in Indiana with a population under 7,000. There is active debate about who accomplished what in the Cote/Anderson era. Insiders viewed them as the odd couple, with sharply different skills and styles that often clashed. My take is that Cote badly needed Anderson and vice versa. The turnaround was too difficult to accomplish without a strong finance head to complement those on the front lines in operations. Regardless of who did what when, Cote deserves the credit for hiring someone who compensated for his weaknesses. In addition, Cote had struggled to connect, or even care to attempt to connect, with investors. He had too much to fix internally to spend an ounce of energy otherwise. Anderson knew how to speak the language that investors trusted.

Once the asbestos and environmental liabilities were stabilized, the pension began to get greater attention. Like most corporate pension plans at that time, it assumed an unrealistic long-term rate of return and discount rate, making it look better on paper than in economic reality. These assumptions were quickly adjusted downward by the more conservative Anderson accounting team. ([Location 2227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2227))

- appointments are up to the job. Cote’s challenges here played into Wall Street’s “not fixable” narrative, but he kept at it and eventually found people good enough to get Honeywell humming again. Despite the mountain of skepticism if not outright contempt, Cote held to his bold ambitions. In my first meeting with him, in spring 2002, I was struck by the clarity of his vision and how broadly he defined success. He wanted to make money for all his stakeholders, not just stockholders. He wanted to treat suppliers well so that they could in turn develop better products for Honeywell. It would be a virtuous circle. He wanted customers to love Honeywell through an exceptional user experience and products that in turn helped the customer to be more successful. Employees, he said, should be paid for performance and even those at the lowest level should be treated with respect. He believed in paying top performers not just for the job they do today, but for the job they will be offered tomorrow. Retention was as big a focus for Cote as recruiting, and he believed in paying executives in stock, so they have the same incentives as owners. He asked his board to pay him in stock options versus just stock; it was a risky bet that could have sunk his compensation if he had failed but instead made him a fortune. Note that in Cote’s early years most executives favored RSUs (restricted stock units) over options because of the downside protection. After the tech bubble burst in 2001, so many stock options became worthless that compensation programs moved sharply away from using them. While some have viewed Cote’s option-heavy pay package as greedy, at the time most viewed it as gutsy, even dumb. Cote also believed in developing leaders, perhaps because of his GE training and how he himself had benefited from development as a young manager. He expected to hire externally for only the first year or two; then the company would have to sustain itself from within. Two Cote quotes I remember from that meeting: “I want to make money on the stock 10 years after I retire” and “I want people to say, ‘If I want a good leader, I hire a Honeywell guy’—except they can’t get our guys because Honeywell is such a great place to have a ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=2249))

- career.” Not only were these grand ambitions for a company on the ropes, but we rarely hear new CEOs at even healthy companies express such long-term visions. Think about it: in the early days of a 15+-year career at Honeywell, Cote was already thinking about his legacy and the stock value after his retirement. In hindsight, it seems Cote wanted to replicate the GE that he grew up with, but in a more collaborative and caring way. He wanted everyone to win. One thing Cote didn’t dwell on in that first meeting was culture. I don’t recall him even using the word. If it was up to Honeywell’s current culture to save the company, Cote knew he didn’t have a chance. Nor was he interested in mandating the culture directly or by waging a war against it. He couldn’t force it; the company was still too fragile. The change had to be sincere and lasting.

- Of the many lessons from the Honeywell turnaround, the time factor is perhaps most critical. Cultures don’t develop and become sustainable overnight. That is a key lesson for the less patient tech world to consider. Patient reinforcement is needed. Honeywell’s results in 2002 versus 2017 show a remarkable improvement, but the progress was steady, requiring daily management and the baby-step gains that are typical of a good Lean manufacturing, process-centric rollout. Despite his lack of a pedigree and the fancy suits that help define success in a shallow world, Cote focused on the basics: having financial discipline in M&A, holding the line on fixed costs, and treating employees with compassion; and he did so with integrity.

That is the point, though. Forecasting is bound to be wrong and should be done as little as possible. The better path is flexible, rapidly responding, Lean operations. The problem is that companies are just too tempted to shortcut the process. The hard part about business systems isn’t getting started, nor is it doing kaizens or talking about Lean; the hard part is staying committed.

- Roper’s success stems from the power of compounding, investing cash into higher- and then . . . even higher-returning assets. For all the value that was created over time at Roper, it all came from a simple acquisition model, a singular management philosophy, and a one-variable compensation scheme. That touches on something we may fail to highlight enough in this book. In all the ways that smart people can complicate all forms of business, the best of the best just seem to focus on a few basic drivers of value. Roper is perhaps the best illustration of this dynamic. Roper’s unconventional CEO, Brian Jellison, saw the market for M&A stuck in an old paradigm—one that undervalued true cash flow, misunderstood the future capital needs of asset-intensive businesses, and overlooked hidden potential liabilities like healthcare, environmental, and pension costs.

- Just a quiet and steady focus on the power of investing cash flow in higher-return assets and using those cash flows to reinvent its portfolio from its cyclical industrial roots to a higher-return, more predictable software future. By 2001, American businesses had lost focus on cash flow, just when that cash was so valuable. Jellison exploited this market inefficiency over and over in a remarkable 17-year run. Unfortunately, Jellison isn’t alive to tell his own story. He passed away in the fall of 2018, shortly after he had stepped down from the CEO role. The nuances of his success may never be known, and we are left to piece it all together from personal interactions with him and those who worked alongside him.

- Critical to Jellison’s contrarian view was the mathematical reality that stock market P/E ratios directly correlate to returns on the underlying asset base of the entity, meaning that P/E ratios usually rise as the returns on the underlying assets grow.

Capital-intensive semiconductor companies traded for the same valuation as low-capital-intensity software assets. Healthcare equipment was valued as highly as healthcare IT software. It made no sense to him. Roper was in a position to exploit all those inefficiencies. With his typical deal profile, Jellison could pay off nearly all the debt from a transaction in as little as three years. All cash could go to service that debt, as opposed to building new factories, paying off an environmental liability, or financing a customer. That quick debt paydown allowed for stepped-up dealmaking. With the high-gross-margin profile of his assets, each incremental unit of growth generated outsized profits and cash, but he didn’t need high growth to make his deals work. Jellison was willing to buy mid-growth. Traditional software companies, like Oracle or Microsoft, generally favored internal new product investment.

Software was in a different world from that of Roper’s traditional businesses, and critics viewed the company as going down a path it didn’t understand. But Jellison saw it more simply, starting with the basic fundamentals of the software sales cycle. Contracts were typically paid up front with the cash often received before the revenue was even booked, such as in a subscription model. Deferred revenue meant that Jellison could run his company on zero or negative working capital. That entire concept made him almost giddy. There were no factories to invest in, and… ([Location 3197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3197))

- operations—in the sales and marketing organization, for example. Jellison could take that 5 percent unit growth, and through operational improvement, he could translate it into nearly 10 percent profit growth. He then could utilize cash to purchase similar assets that would add another 5 to 10 percent to the top line, translating over time to 15 to 20 percent annualized profit growth. He did this without using equity and maintaining investment-grade debt. Few companies can sustain high-teens profit growth over time. Jellison was in that ballpark most of his 17 years as CEO. The TransCore deal was the perfect beta test for Roper’s unique M&A and governance models and would be the start of the modern Roper.

He explained the CRI concept and his view that as Roper’s returns rose, so would its P/E multiple.

This was exactly the reason for the mispricing in the first place: deals just looked expensive, both to M&A bankers and to the CEOs and boards they advised. Jellison’s successes were often explained by critics as luck and pure financial engineering. In hindsight, too many good things happened at Roper over too many years for it to be mere accident.

So much so that when Danaher closes a deal as the buyer, the first thing it asks is, “What didn’t you tell us?” Common problems could be an unhappy customer, product-quality issues, or a product launch that’s not going as well as reported. Sometimes the issues are very small, but if not fixed fast, they could become a bigger problem down the road. Danaher wants to know the issues as quickly as possible so it can prevent the “down-the-road” part. Danaher deals tend to be large, so there is always some element of surprise. This is just fine, given that much of Danaher’s success comes from the management system it is applying to the asset, which often requires a turnaround. Roper does smaller deals relatively speaking, does not do turnarounds, and wants no such postdiligence headaches, because when it closes a deal, it backs off and lets the company run as is, with new incentives usually, but with management intact. Roper wants all the pros and cons out on the table, well before it goes down the bidding path.

The corporate HQ of Roper has a grand total of about 50 employees, the usual legal, tax, HR, and IR functions and not much else. Jellison didn’t want a big staff of internal dealmakers. The hard diligence, he believed, was with the people themselves, and he felt that only someone at the senior level could have much of a trained eye for management. He needed to be able to ask the tough questions, and that’s the only way he was comfortable doing a deal. Diligence with the management team was critical, because Roper deals have to include a management team that it could retain. Jellison wanted continuity. He didn’t want the customer experience to change, and he didn’t want the deal itself to be an excuse for leaders to cash out and leave. He wanted the team, and he incentivized the team members to stay and perform to a high standard. But he only wanted assets with A-grade management teams. The deals he turned down through the years were more likely due to ([Location 3256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3256))

While Jellison and his senior team did diligence on management, he would outsource the actual business quality analysis to industry experts, firms such as Bain, McKinsey, or Boston Consulting Group. They may have been more expensive than internal staff, but Jellison wanted an independent view with customer diligence. In his experience, internal M&A folks were biased, wanted to do deals, heard only positive customer opinions, and dismissed the negative data points. And he didn’t believe that Roper had time to do it all. The sale process wasn’t long enough for his team to become experts in every facet of the company, so he paid up to have that analysis done externally. That doesn’t mean that he ignored the operations. With the company managers and experts in the room together, he asked tough questions.

Once Jellison was comfortable with the management team, product profile, and likely growth algorithm, he could sign off on a deal model that was clear on what price the deal would work at and at what price it wouldn’t. After a transaction closed, we never saw Jellison worry about overpaying, because he knew exactly what he was getting. The Roper process seems to cut down the risk profile to an almost uncanny extent. Of the 50+ deals we observed Jellison do in his 17 years, we can name only a couple that didn’t work out, and those were just modest disappointments. The risk profile was also lowered, because there was no such thing as “integration risk.” Roper assets are autonomous, never integrated.

- After a deal closes, Roper focuses on a basic governance model: setting up incentives, doing the relevant benchmarking where it makes sense, and giving the business the tools it needs for success, including a healthy dose of Jellison teachings. Roper executives got paid very well but were expected to deliver results. Jellison demanded excellence and was hard to work for, especially if you were having a tough time growing the profit base. His biggest pet peeve was with underperforming managers who didn’t understand why they were failing. And those who didn’t ask for help when needed. The stars were left alone to perform as they were hired to. There were a few common problems that Roper saw in its acquired businesses. The first was that high-CRI companies tend to underinvest in sales and marketing and overinvest in the product and in the back office.

Many of these companies didn’t even attempt to expand outside of large city centers or to think globally. Jellison raised the growth rate just by having more sales coverage. He also did a lot of educating on the front lines on sales channel management, teaching the importance of increasing hit rates and maximizing existing client coverage. In the world of software, he saw salespeople inadvertently talk clients into postponing purchases because a new product version was coming out in six months. Since new products are often late, that six months could often become 12 months. That delay often ended up driving the customer to a competitor.

- For management teams within Roper, Jellison kept compensation schemes simple. Profit growth was his preferred metric, which made sense given the types of assets in the portfolio. One of the benefits of owning capital-light businesses was that Jellison didn’t have to worry about measuring or paying for returns. As profits grew, returns compounded and profits were equal to or lower than actual cash. He didn’t have to focus on one or the other; they went hand in hand. Jellison wanted simplicity and a common goal line. One thing he never incentivized for was market share. He didn’t want managers to push bad contracts to gain share. He gladly spent on R&D to develop best-in-class products, but the goal was always about compounding value. Because all his acquisitions were high gross margin and low capital intensity, paying on profit growth meant that managers really had to get only the top-line growth measure right. That was the most powerful lever they could pull. The incentive to grow with and above the market was already there.

- This is an oversimplification. Yes, TransDigm’s story does include debt and the serial acquisition of companies with strong market positions. But it doesn’t stop there. TransDigm would still be successful with a fraction of the price increases that the company has enjoyed over the years. This is because every day, from the factory floor to the C-suite, the people at TransDigm only focus on what truly matters for their consistent success. This chapter is about an organization that compounds value at an extraordinary rate. It’s about the power of a business model built on strategic and operating discipline and a relentless focus on the drivers of value creation for the company’s owners—its employees and investors. It’s about the optimization of internal and external investment as well as capital and cost structure. Many of the successful industrial companies we discuss in this book have very formalized businesses systems; TransDigm isn’t one of them. However, any lack of formality is more than made up for by the company’s strict adherence to its core principles of value-based ([Location 3348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3348))

My aha moment came during a meeting with former CEO Nicholas Howley and a TransDigm investor. In an effort to knock Howley off balance, the investor forcefully asked him why he should believe in the company following Howley’s recent sale of millions of dollars of stock. Howley stunned me when he sat up in his chair, put his elbows on the boardroom table, looked the guy in the eye, and said: “This may come as a surprise ([Location 3390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3390))

- The highest profit margins in the industrial world are in the aerospace aftermarket. General Electric makes 60 percent margins on replacement turbine blades; spare brake pads generate 70 percent margins for companies like Honeywell and United Technologies; and navigation software updates can approach 100 percent margins. A large portion of the aerospace parts industry is built on a razor/razorblade business model, where the original equipment parts are sold to Boeing and Airbus for very little profit or a loss. Many years later, when that same part requires replacement, it is sold to an airline for a price that is a multiple of the original price charged to the aircraft manufacturer. Spare parts demand is generally stable, as parts are replaced regularly and planes are constantly flying. The older an airplane gets, the more expensive it becomes to operate. This leads to shrinking fleets, as older, more expensive planes are retired or used less frequently in favor of newer, more efficient aircraft. By this time in an aircraft’s life cycle, the likelihood of an alternative part being certified is increasingly low—new entrants ([Location 3407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3407))

- struggle to justify the engineering and regulatory investment required to sell a new part into a shrinking market against an already established and trusted competitor. This allows the legacy manufacturers to push through annual price increases more aggressively. This pricing power more than offsets the declines in volume and justifies keeping production lines running efficiently, as incoming order velocity slows. These parts generate a ton of profit. For most large aerospace companies, these highly lucrative parts are produced alongside far less attractive parts that don’t earn anywhere near the same level of profit. Take United Technologies, where a super profitable brake business is tied up with metal landing gear, which is a capital-intensive and non-spare-parts–generating business with low margins. And that’s just one example. The aerospace industry is littered with collections of good businesses alongside bad ones—except at TransDigm. The average operating profit margin in the global aerospace industry is ~15 percent. TransDigm’s is ~50 percent. (See Figure 9.4.)

- McKechnie executive admitted to me that his company was simply trying to replicate TransDigm’s success. Before McKechnie ever had a chance to go public, TransDigm acquired it for $1.3 billion. At the time, the deal was the largest in the company’s history, and many questioned how much value TransDigm could create since McKechnie was already a TransDigm “clone.” The McKechnie executive I knew was shown the door months after the deal closed, but he was there long enough to gain perspective on the differences between the two organizations. Shortly after he was let go, he told me that he was blown away by the TransDigm leaders. He said, “These guys are so much better than I ever imagined. . . . I totally underestimated how they do what they do . . . it’s crazy, because every day we were trying to copy them.” Over the years, TransDigm’s operational discipline has gotten far too little attention. And this discipline extends beyond the factory floor and the sales department. It touches so many other functions that amplify the value generated in the production facilities.

- To the untrained eye, TransDigm’s collection of pumps, valves, and switches isn’t particularly exciting compared with the product lines of other aerospace companies or those in the tech world. However, TransDigm has proven that even “boring” businesses can be extremely lucrative when focused strategic and operating principles are applied relentlessly. TransDigm has consistently created value with every dollar of capital invested. Its persistent focus on price and cost, combined with secular tailwinds from growing air travel, has generated significant profits. Those profits have been diligently reinvested in similar businesses where the same value drivers can be applied, and waste is minimized. The business model is kicked into overdrive by the thoughtful addition of leverage and employees who are compensated as owners. There are always hiccups, but over any measurable period, value is consistently created. The COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably put TransDigm to the test, as a lack of flying by the general public will hit aerospace suppliers hard in 2020. TransDigm will not be immune but the company’s strong operational discipline and dispassionate adherence to its principles of value creation will almost certainly see it emerge from the crisis in a better position than peers. Over time, passengers will return to the skies and airplanes will consume spare parts. When that happens, the TransDigm model will again be on display.

While that debate rages on, TDG continues to succeed by knowing exactly where and how to apply effort, focus, talent, and capital.

Good is simply not enough, and greatness often lives in organizing everything around the core value creation engine of a company. TransDigm is what great looks like. Other businesses and their leaders can be well served by understanding the discrete advantages of their end markets and product lines and designing an operating and financial system that aims to maximize those characteristics.

- An early step was to implement Lean manufacturing, the foundation for any competent manufacturer. At SBD the move to Lean was the result of some hard lessons learned. The number of distinct products offered (stock keeping units, or SKUs) had steadily multiplied as the consumer-facing nature of the business drove an endless search for new and improved products. Customer focus is a positive, but the company didn’t trim enough of the older lines: in 1998 it still had 140,000 SKUs, and 85,000 of them represented under 2 percent of sales. That is a mess of inefficiency and stale inventory. With so many different products, managers weren’t using a pull-through system or even planning production for products individually; instead they applied large-scale guessing of overall tool demand. That led to too much money tied up in inventory and losses when stale products went unsold. Lean manufacturing is the opposite of all that.

- In a true recession, capital-intensive industries can be an exercise in who can take the most pain while others are shutting down. Rental equipment similarly doesn’t make money if it’s not rented, and rental has lower barriers to entry than do airlines. United Rentals built a towering competitive advantage the hard way. In doing so it raised its margins substantially, widening the gap with competition, creating tens of thousands of good jobs, and professionalizing a scattered and entrepreneurial industry along the way. There is a lesson for the new economy here. Designing a breakthrough software app at Uber created an industry, but managing an extremely large, asset-intensive chain is something else, and the costs of doing so poorly are creeping up. Uber may not own cars, but that doesn’t make it an asset-light business model overall. Equipment rental is asset sharing, old economy style. It differs in several ways from the recent versions created by Uber, Airbnb, and WeWork. First, it doesn’t shy away from owning assets: it’s a hardware management business, not just software.

If you drive by a rental yard, you might see a collection of tall booms reaching two or three stories into the sky. Those are aerial work platforms, designed to lift a person up in the air (whereas cranes lift steel beams and other construction materials). They lift workers from one to more than fifteen stories, for jobs of all kinds: painting, doing construction or repair work, changing lightbulbs in factories, and so on. It is a versatile product that replaces ladders and scaffolds, which are far more dangerous. Aerials constitute by far the largest category handled by rental outfits, but there are many others, particularly at United Rentals. Managing this variation requires the systematic improvements in operations that have been applied by the leaders, allowing for expansion… ([Location 3918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3918))

One of my last jobs in college, as a geology student, involved hopping down into a freshly dug trench, without such safety bracing. I can still remember the urgency with which the lead scientist wanted to take measurements and get the hell out. United Rentals rents out dehumidifiers for emergency drying after floods or hurricanes, preventing huge losses that might otherwise result. It rents out portable HVAC systems, saving patients in hospitals and allowing work to continue in buildings where the AC has gone out. The business is built on the fact that renting is often cheaper than buying. If you use the equipment sporadically, a few days or weeks at a time, it makes no sense to own it.

- floor cleaning equipment might not be expensive, but it requires a closet in a place where real estate is expensive. It needs someone to maintain the equipment, to know where to get parts, to know how to fix it, etc. That’s a hassle, and it represents a series of hidden expenses that companies increasingly don’t need to own. From the outside the business sounds simple: buy equipment; rent it out; collect money. But success requires good management of several different processes. It’s a combination of logistics to pick up and deliver the equipment, repair and maintenance, customer service, customer acquisition, and fleet management.

- Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway has been quoted as saying, “I think I’ve been in the top 5 percent of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I’ve underestimated it.” In the case of United Rentals, the incentive puzzle wasn’t hard. Managers had been compensated on growing EBITDA. In other words, they were paid for revenue and profit growth but were not charged for the fleet they owned. That promoted a simple, pro-growth decision: buy more stuff and worry about renting it later. It didn’t encourage managers to wring utilization out of the fleet they already had, since buying another machine might be easier than trying to turn one around in the repair yard faster. This seems like an obvious mistake, but compensation practices are often surprisingly misaligned. So was the lack of equipment and customer sharing among branches, meaning a core potential advantage for United Rentals was going unused. The new metrics were simple: “return on controllable assets” with a hurdle rate to reflect that assets ([Location 3983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=3983))

Flannery had also previously tweaked compensation in some regions to focus more on broader district results, which worked well. That approach was applied to the company as a whole. As a result, 70 percent of compensation for both branch and district managers was tied to district results rather than branch results, a move that immediately connected employees and encouraged collaboration.

- Most companies we follow don’t get the first step right for starting compounding growth: good operations, founded in continuous improvement, that drive a widening gap versus competitors. Margin expansion is great, but it only really counts if it is systematic and repeatable. Margins at United Rentals have improved by more than double the industrials group average over the past decade, through systematic improvements. (See Figure 11.3.)

- The second step is using the improved profits to acquire new assets. The fragmentation of the rental industry is fertile ground for acquisitions, and thanks to its operational strengths, United Rentals has both ample targets and plenty of cash to deploy. Finally comes raising margins at the acquired companies, systematically, so the process can repeat in a virtuous cycle. Lots of companies do acquisitions; far too many in fact. There are reasons why most acquisitions fail to create value: trying to buy companies without a well-defined way ([Location 4107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=4107))

- We only follow the new asset-sharing tech companies casually, but they don’t seem to be driving lower cost and greater efficiency in the same way. Our own office for Melius Research started in a WeWork building, because it was a flexible way to start a business. We use Uber for seeing clients, with ease and real savings. Yet there are signs that these models are failing to create widening, sustained value. The companies might not own the assets, and they may not have employees. The assets are still there, though, and the “contractors” still cost money—if not for the business, for the customer. Outsourcing all the unpleasant and capital-intensive parts of the business is what makes it a tech play. But having the assets outside the system also limits the ability to optimize and raises the overall system cost, diminishing its attractiveness for consumers. You can’t easily tell a contractor how to work more efficiently. You can’t easily tell drivers to move away from an oversaturated area if they are independent.

- Costs seem to be rising, and satisfaction seems to be dropping. One of the first Uber drivers I talked to was in London, sometime around 2012. He loved it. He took care of his daughter during the day and figured he may as well drive for a few hours while she was in school. He had a nice, basic Mercedes as a personal car, and so the opportunity was true flexibility. Today the drivers don’t feel the same. Uber driving is often a full-time job, for people with poor credit history and high costs. Drivers in New York City rent or lease the cars, with this expense plus insurance running up to $2,000 a month. Uber isn’t effectively using its scale to lower system costs to the customer. Instead, it’s simply pushing the capital-intensive cost onto people with the highest cost of capital, people with borrowing costs in the 15–20 percent range. Even bad, asset-intensive industrials borrow at under 5 percent these days. The source of profit to Uber is the desperation of its drivers, not superior systemwide efficiency.

- New York City are now often considerably higher. Uber launched with a no-tipping structure, with drivers making enough without tips. Now tipping is strongly encouraged, which is effectively another layer of price increase. The physical assets still exist, and they are poorly run by many drivers. Right now, ride-hailing apps in New York have vehicles that run about half as many trips a month as do yellow cabs (and about a quarter as many as yellow cabs used to do before Uber came along). That’s a substantially less efficient use of an expensive vehicle versus the use of the old yellow cabs. Lower efficiency is also adding to congestion, slowing down traffic for everyone. It may not just be the management of the heavy assets that needs to be improved.

Most fail to make durable progress. Making an actual system work takes years of disciplined implementation. Software as a sector hasn’t come up with differentiated and systematic workflows. For companies like Uber, that is an expensive problem: 3,000 software engineers and data scientists in a company expected to lose $3 billion in operating profits on less than $20 billion in revenue. This failure to build in rigorous continuous improvement is unsurprising and certainly not unique to software or technology. As competition grows, winners will need a bigger moat.

Some did it with brilliant success, some with fantastic failure, and some with a mix of each. The data on the successful cases kept pointing us to three common drivers: a relentless discipline on costs, cash flow, and capital deployment. The companies that rose to the top in our study used their high and growing cash flows to widen the moat within their existing businesses while gravitating investments to higher-return opportunities—and repeated these actions over and over.

- Business systems also help organizations focus on the main tenet of creating value. They focus on a simple question: What does the customer actually value, and how do we supply that at the lowest possible cost? Note that we say what does the customer actually value, not what you want the customer to value. That’s basic stuff, but only half the companies that we have studied live that baseline principle with any real discipline. Voice of the customer is an important tool that is increasingly being adopted by the best companies to drive that very conversation. It’s another way of driving focus—as long as you are actually listening to the customer in the spirit of “two ears, one mouth.” ([Location 4251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=4251))

- There is a common perception that the companies that innovate the best, while getting the “other stuff” (like manufacturing) mostly or somewhat right, are the ones that succeed over time.

- and far more difficult to accomplish than perceived. Most companies do it once, providing the foundation for their existence, and then never do it again at anywhere close to the impact of that foundational event. Setting the expectation that an organization hits a home run on every innovation typically leads to no innovation at all. Take 3M, the Minnesota-based maker of tapes and adhesives. Its most famous innovation was arguably the Post-it Note, a ubiquitous sticky-paper product, the sales of which continue to grow with high and rising profit margins. It was a disruptive product innovation from 40 years ago. But the curse of the Post-it Note is that 3M scientists have spent the better part of the last few decades trying to duplicate its impact. Achieving disruption of this magnitude while predicting future customer needs is extremely difficult, particularly when you consider that the Post-it Note, like many other top innovations, was created largely by accident. After that celebrated innovation, the company became so focused on the next big thing that it often forgot to do the small things well. 3M is still ([Location 4266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=4266))

That said, there have been notable periods of brilliance, with two of the last five CEOs achieving remarkable results. The difference? The two CEOs, Jim McNerney and Inge Thulin, established two very common and simple mandates: the first was a hyperfocus on manufacturing excellence and included holding the line on costs in every part of the organization; the second established accountability for commercial outcomes in the R&D organization. Each of the CEOs made it very clear, via incentives and otherwise, that profit growth mattered more than market share and that developing new products (often incremental improvements on proven platforms) that customers were willing to pay a premium for today was far more important than shooting for the moon tomorrow. Commercial behavior took precedence over disruption. ([Location 4274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084YXHNXH&location=4274))

It’s notable that the two most successful companies in industrials over the past two decades, TransDigm and Roper, have no mandate, desire, or effort at all related to disruption. Each has created tremendous value purely by focusing employees on growing the cash flow of the businesses and levering that cash flow by investing in niche, high-return assets.

- In contrast, the most successful companies rely on a system and a group of leaders capable of getting ordinary people to succeed consistently over time while empowering the stars to perform as expected. The risk is that if you lose half your stars because an industry is out of favor or the company is going through a tough time, or you seat that rising star next to a time-sucking dud, or worse, you have her report to a total jerk, then the ratio of bad to good gets even worse. The bad ones never leave on their own. The good ones always have choices. As we noted in the Honeywell chapter, legendary CEO Dave Cote once said to us that he kept his stars by paying them not just for the job they did today, but for the job they would be offered tomorrow. Obviously, companies have to narrow down that small group of truly talented managers, or that strategy gets pretty expensive. But Cote did an amazing job of keeping his top talent on board, getting average folks to step up, and filtering out those who were destructive. The Honeywell Operating System was a big part of that success—perhaps because it exposed ineffective leaders earlier than they would have been exposed otherwise.

- It’s notable that even great CEOs often begin to struggle as they get past a decade or so into their tenure at the top. Perhaps that is because their strategies don’t cross over into different eras. Or maybe they just get increasingly distracted and struggle to maintain the message and focus. We’ve seen examples of both. The academic world has done studies on CEOs feeling isolated and disconnected and often reporting to boards of directors they characterize as dysfunctional. All these are real signs of burnout, particularly if these CEOs lack the energy or empowerment to drive the change they see as required.

We could probably list upward of a hundred examples of this dynamic, including some pretty famous last-inning flops from some pretty talented folks. Even folks we celebrate in this book would have been better served had they exited a year or two before they did.

- Culture isn’t something you can force or even actively promote using just words. It’s purely a result of the concrete directions and examples you give to people. It’s usually driven by whatever the leaders focus on, their actions and the incentives set around the organizational deliverables. Leaders can’t impose a culture through just words, but if they embrace a system, use it consistently with their direct reports, and broadcast it to the organization, then eventually you get a culture pretty close to whatever that system encourages.

- The more consistent the message and the longer the duration of the effort, the stronger the culture. Culture and loyalty tend to go hand in hand. If bad behavior is stamped out and employees feel safe and empowered, that helps to define the very base level of the culture. If performance is fairly rewarded, that helps to define the more positive component of the culture. Both serve to underpin a culture with loyalty as an important by-product. We recently saw a viral post on LinkedIn that relates to this theme. It simply stated, “Millennials don’t leave companies, they leave bad managers.” Not sure who wrote this, but it sure seems accurate. And while culture takes a long time to develop, it can be lost in a nanosecond. For example, if leaders don’t embrace a clear system, then they’re likely to adopt the flavor of the day. And the distraction of a constantly changing message alone can allow bad managers to flourish.

- Future investment is essential, in ways people don’t always understand. The key to long-term success is creating a powerful advantage over rivals, which is necessary for survival when the inevitable crisis hits. Whether it’s superior quality in technically complex products, marketing prowess, or advantaged distribution networks, these don’t come right away. Companies have to build a moat with sustained investments in competitively important areas. If done well, those investments should eventually yield ever-higher results. More profits, invested at the higher rate of return generated by the moat, lead to even more profits, and so on—the power of compounding—on the flywheel. Companies can invest cash internally in operations and new products or externally in acquisitions; it depends on the opportunities available. The key is to generate returns on that investment, translated into cash flow, that show compounding growth in profits. Better yet, companies that master capital deployment (by regularly shifting in search of the highest return: organic growth, acquisitions, dividends, or share repurchases) win lower funding costs as investors pay up for that success and debt rating agencies see better execution. Lower funding costs result in greater compounding, which gives those companies the essential resilience to survive over long periods, particularly important in periods of unexpected disruption like the one we are currently experiencing with this year’s pandemic.

That growth algorithm can prove particularly important in keeping investors interested during times of stock market distress.

The other is a well-established process for feedback, which enables continuous improvement, the core of any successful industrial, though one too often trapped on the factory floor rather than spread throughout the organization.
