## Highlights
- But if being busy keeps you from doing what matters most to you, or if it leads you to do things you deem unwise, like getting angry at a rotary telephone, then being busy is a problem. This book is about both the problem and the opportunity—where this peculiar life comes from and how to turn it to your advantage.

- In its energy, excitement, and excess, in its novelty, speed, chaos, and confusion, in its dust storm of data, in its creative spirit and freedom from convention, in its emphasis on adaptability and on the now, in its ever changing nature, in its irreverence and incoherence, today’s world looks much like another world I know well: the world of attention deficit disorder, or ADD. ADD is a medical condition I have specialized in diagnosing and treating for the past twenty-five years. I have come to see it as a metaphor for modern life, offering a model—as well as a guide—for what’s happening today in a world where we are living a kind of life never lived before. Once applicable only to a relative few, the symptoms of ADD now seem to describe just about everybody. People with untreated ADD rush around a lot, feel impatient wherever they are, love speed, get frustrated easily, lose focus in the middle of a task or a conversation because some other thought catches their attention, bubble with energy but struggle to pay attention to one issue for more than a few seconds, talk fast or feel at a loss for words, often forget where they’re going or what they’re going to get, have bright ideas but can’t implement them, fail to complete what they’re doing, have many projects going simultaneously but chronically postpone completing them, make decisions impulsively because their brain’s circuitry is overloaded, feel they could do a lot more if they could just get it together, get angry easily when interrupted, feel powerless over the piles of stuff that surround them, resolve each day to do better tomorrow, and in general feel busy beyond belief but not all that productive. Many people who do not have true ADD do have many of those symptoms these days. You might say they suffer from a severe case of modern life.

- We learn the wisdom of what a rabbi once said: “Happiness is not having what you want but wanting what you have.” We control enough of life to relish what we have. Then we gain dependable joy. As Samuel Johnson said some 250 years ago, “The pleasures of sudden wonder are soon exhausted, and the mind can only repose upon the stability of truth.” Paradoxically, at the core of that “stability” is the acceptance of instability, of change.

- Of course, many practical concerns keep people busy, but behind all of them lies a reason most people don’t acknowledge or even perceive. At the deepest level—the level we rarely visit—we stay busy to avoid looking into the abyss. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=153))

- We keep busy to warm us with feelings of power, productivity, and progress. We feed the illusion that we can defeat death, that ultimate confounder of our control. We stay busy to look away from loss, tragedy, and pain. We stay busy to control the whole shebang. Of course, death wins. All the activity the whole world can generate can’t bring back one person who has died. This is perhaps the hardest truth any of us ever learns. Acceptance—not busyness—brings us to a peaceful place. By accepting that we do not have total control, by accepting death, by accepting our ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=156))

- Multitasking ineffectively—what I call “frazzing”—is a common mistake that busy people make, frantically hoping that will work. If the task matters, it is better that you do it by itself. That way you can give it your full attention. There is an exception. You can ride a bicycle and ponder quantum mechanics at the same time. If you’re good, you could ride a bicycle and mix pancake batter at the same time. This is because the riding of the bicycle is done on automatic pilot. You have practiced riding bikes long enough for the skill to be embedded in your brain’s automatic pilot, the cerebellum (more on this later).

- At the heart of making the most of life today is the ability to treasure and protect your connections to what you care most about: people, places, activities, pets, a spiritual connection, a piece of music, even objects that are dear to you. But you must not have too many connections or none will flourish. Pick the ones that matter most to you and nourish them religiously; make that your top priority in life, and you can’t go wrong.

- “Rhythm” is my word for the complex set of neurological and physiological events that create the apparent effortlessness of a person doing complicated work well: me at the grill or you doing whatever you do best. You probably make it look easy. But it took you years of practice to get there. If you have ever watched a professional golfer on TV, you have probably remarked on how easy he or she makes it look. If you have watched a pianist, you may have wondered how he or she coordinates those finger movements so fluidly.

- It is impossible to make all this happen consciously. You must rely on your rhythm. You can’t stay on top of all the details of life and also be ready for all the opportunities and dangers. You have to rely on rhythm—or some equivalent. Whatever our brains can do and computers can’t do, that is what comes to the rescue for us if we allow it to and set up the conditions that favor its growth. I call it rhythm. It is a special force that allows us to do much more than we think. Whatever you call it, you have to develop a force you trust, a force that will guide you to remember what you need to remember, do what you need to do, choose what you need to choose, and avoid what you need to avoid.

- While hope itself is not a strategy, without it you’ll never formulate a good one. But how difficult it is to feel up when you’re down, and how easy it is to feel overwhelmed by the volume, speed, blather, and worry in life, especially when you’re down. When you’re up, you ride this fast life like a surfer atop a great wave, but when you’re down you wipe out. Our task now is to learn how to use the technology we’ve invented, rather than allow it to use us, so that it improves our human connections, and does not replace them. Once the thrill of driving wears off, the teenager gets tired of going just anywhere and becomes more fussy in her choice of destinations. If there’s no place special to go, she might just stay at home. We need to learn to be more fussy in how much we log on, watch, transmit, chat, surf, or IM. We need to be careful that we don’t allow our electronic devices—and the curious magnetism they exert upon our minds—to take control of us, spurring us to go faster and faster, to do more and more, to track more and more data points, and, in general, to believe that being busy is the enlightened way of life. Instead, being deeply connected to what matters most is the enlightened way of life. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=675))

- Jumping up from the table, talking on the cell phone non-stop, checking messages every hour if not more, rushing off to the next vital appointment—isn’t this what important people do? Doesn’t being busy mean that you are successful? Actually, not necessarily. Warren Buffett sits at his computerless desk in Nebraska and thinks. Bill Gates takes two weeks off every year to go to a cabin in the woods to . . . think. An unknown but talented poet sits somewhere right now in silence, grappling with his imagination to find the right word. Two lovers sit silently side by side in chairs by a lake right now, connecting intimately without speaking. A ten-year-old boy hovers over a frog he has stalked for the past twenty minutes. Now, he just watches. Rather than capture the frog, he watches. He likes watching it. In fact, busy is not always best. A force that I call “gemmelsmerch” tugs at our attention all the time. Gemmelsmerch is a meaningless word I made up to describe the ubiquitous force that distracts us from whatever we’re doing. Gemmelsmerch works through many channels. Indeed, the many channels on today’s television create gemmelsmerch, as we become distracted by the opportunity to watch something else even if we are enjoying what we are watching. What if something better is on? In ages past, we might have wondered if something better was on, but we wouldn’t have had three hundred channels to check out the possibility. A better job, a better book, a better restaurant, a better romantic partner—they are all there for our perusal much more immediately than ever before. What a boon! But with this boon comes multifarious gemmelsmerch. Having treated ADD since 1981, I began to see an upsurge in the mid-1990s in the number of people who complained of being chronically inattentive, disorganized, and overbooked. Many came to me wondering if they had ADD. While some did, most did not. Instead, they had what I called a severe case of modern life. This imitator was not the true, genetically transmitted syndrome of attention deficit disorder, but an environmentally induced stand-in. Because I saw it so often, not only in my practice but in the lives of everyone around me, I started to give this condition names. First I just called it modern life, then pseudo-ADD, then attention deficit trait, and for this book I named it “F-state,” because so many of the adjectives one could use to describe it begin with the letter f: frantic, frenzied, forgetful, flummoxed, frustrated, and fragmented, to name a few.

- From all this busyness, another of the many paradoxes of modern life emerges: The faster we go, the more we take on; and the more we take on, the more there is for us to do. Labor-saving devices thus create more labor. By shortening the time and energy it takes to do any one thing, these devices free up time and energy to do more things.

- One of the words is entirely nonsensical; I made it up to describe a force in nature that has no name, the force that distracts us from what we want to be doing. It didn’t need a name until the current age because it was never as ubiquitous or dangerous as it is today. The name I gave I mentioned in the last chapter: “gemmelsmerch.” ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=872))

- Taildogging: Going faster or pushing harder—on yourself, your children, your business, your spouse—simply because other people are doing so. Allowing the tail to wag the dog, you take on more than you want to for yourself, for your children, or for others mostly out of fear that if you don’t, you—or your children, family, or business—will be left behind in life’s great race. People buy into myths en masse, myths like: that a child having an expensive computer leads to success in school, or that driving a Mercedes is good for the soul, or that being a member of a club you don’t enjoy will somehow enhance your life, or that having a swimming pool is one of life’s necessities, or that an outrageously expensive, lavish birthday party for a seven-year-old is de rigueur. These myths are the tails that wag the dogs, our lives. How many people do you know who are planning a birthday party they can’t afford simply because one of their children’s friends had such a party?

Those two states are separated by the precious interlude of warning. To acquire the skill of identifying the interlude when you’re in it, all you have to do is know that it exists and then listen to what your mind and body tell you. During the interlude, if you listen, you will hear yourself telling yourself, You are about to lose it. Don’t take the bait. Back away. Go outside. Take a break. Listening to that voice can save a career, a marriage, or at least a day. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1196))

- C-state is clear, calm, cool, collected, consistent, concentrated, convivial, careful, curious, creative, courteous, and coordinated. On the other hand, F-state fractures focus and is frenzied, feckless, flailing, fearful, forgetful, flustered, furious, fractious, feverish, and frantic. It can also drive one to utter the famous f-word. In C-state you have found your rhythm. In F-state you have lost it.

- As I mentioned earlier, F-state resembles attention deficit disorder. In ADD, the brain races and can’t stop owing to its genetically set wiring. The chief problem with this race car brain is that its brakes do not work well. It’s got a Ferrari engine but Chevrolet brakes. It can win races if it develops adequate brakes, but it will crash and burn if it doesn’t. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1255))

- The common association of fast with smart (and slow with stupid) is particularly misleading. Some people have brains that process information quickly, while others process information slowly. This can be measured by neuropsychological testing, which divides people into two groups: fast processors and slow processors. The fast processors, like Robin Williams, often dazzle us with their verbal dexterity, leading us to believe they are brilliant. The slow processors, like Eeyore, keep us drumming our fingers, waiting for them to get to the point, leading us to believe they are stupid.

- Before you read further, please stop and answer the following question: Where do you do your best thinking? Try asking the next ten people you meet where they do their best thinking. You’ll be surprised how many say, “In the shower.” Or the runner-up: “In my car.” Few, if any, will say they do their best thinking at work, where, it might be supposed, thinking is the order of the day. What’s so special about the shower? Furthermore, what’s so special about thinking? Don’t we do it automatically, all the time? And why does the workplace not produce better thinking? To take those questions in reverse order: What a person does at work is too goal directed and contaminated by gemmelsmerch to allow the free play of ideas that great thinking requires. Work devotes itself (usually) to the rush and the gush and teems with worry, blather, and clutter. Thinking, although sometimes overrated, is special for many reasons, chief among them: Only by thinking well will we save ourselves from destruction; only by thinking well will we discover and learn how to make use of the new ideas that advance civilization; ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1560))

- and only by thinking well will we figure out the best way to get from here to there. While our brains are always active, even when we are asleep, thinking is neither automatic nor constant. A moment of thinking varies in intensity and duration as much as attention does. Indeed, the two go hand in hand. Thinking, which might be defined as focused attention combined with active trapping and sculpting of the objects of focus, ranges in quality from imitative and predictable to original, from feeble to strong, from inhibited to bold. A challenge people have always faced is how to improve the quality of their thinking. Now, because of the peculiar obstacles to thought posed by modern life, that challenge is particularly formidable. One of the best ways to improve the quality, intensity, and duration of thinking is to make use of the principles outlined in this chapter. Finally, showers promote good thinking because showers induce a state of comfort, calm, and relaxation. They stimulate all five senses: the feel of the water on the skin and the feel of the steam; the sounds of the shower; the smells of the soaps, shampoos, and whatever else is in the environs; the taste of the water; and the sight of the parts of your body that you see as you wash them, as well as the stall or the tub that you’re in. This runs counter to the notion that we do our best mental work in an area free of much sensory stimulation, such as a quiet, well-lit room or a library.

- If not in the shower, other people say they do their best thinking while driving, which is also a place of multisensory stimulation. Showers and the car share one more quality: When you are in them, your mind is free to go where it wants. No one is telling you what to do, what to work on, or what to think about, which gives you access to what your mind has been thinking about without your knowing it, or what is sometimes called “the unconscious.” What your mind is thinking about without your knowing it is the source of your best ideas. The unconscious is like a great incubator. You can see such incubation in the writing of a novel, or the designing of a building, or the creation of an ad campaign, or the putting together of a game plan for football, or in any effort we call creative. When at last the product is ready to venture into the world, the original idea is usually as invisible as the human egg is to a newborn baby. It has been incorporated, divided, and, most of all, developed. The process of finding ideas and growing… ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1580))

- Perhaps the greatest damage done by F-state is that it stifles this process, as if blocking the mind’s tubes. If a person is too busy, too distracted, and too overwhelmed by data and demands, attention is not available to fertilize the egg when the germ of a new idea takes shape. In F-state, all a person thinks about—even in the shower or while driving—is how to make the deadline, return the calls, gather the information, or reach the destinations before time runs out. This person’s attention has no time for anything else. As is always the case when toxic emotions bubble up, attention loses the flexibility required for high-quality thought. Single-minded, rigid, black-and-white, low-grade thinking ensues. The greatest danger of being overwhelmed is not that you will fail to meet your goals, but that you will fail to think at your best and to give birth to your best ideas. As was once said, the problem is not that people aim too high and miss, it’s that they aim too low and hit. In F-state, you won’t… ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1590))

- I asked Jack about this. I asked him, “Where did you get the idea for the clothesline?” His answer was the honest answer most people give when asked where their new ideas come from. “I don’t know,” he said. I pressed him, but he still did not know. The egg of the idea rolled out from the unconscious, and Jack was relaxed enough to pay attention to it. He took it and grew it and made it into something new. Had he been in F-state—which Jack rarely is—he would not have picked up on the idea. Of course, that wouldn’t have mattered. Jack’s clothesline was not an idea the world needed to have. But the world does need to foster and protect the conditions under which he came up with the idea.

- and data driven, we will not notice the new ideas that roll into consciousness, and they will disappear. To come up with their best ideas, people need time not only to stop and think, but also to fiddle around, to play with what they’ve got, as Jack did with the clothes on the floor. If you keep looking for more data—more clothes—you will never synthesize what you do have into something important. And if you feel excessive pressure to come up with a specific result, to reach a specific goal, you will never reach a goal you had never thought of. You will never surprise yourself or the world.

- The central solution I offer in this book is this: Make sure you do what matters most to you. Everything else in this book is offered in support of that one goal.

- Keep in mind that while the central solution asks you to take charge, it cautions against seeking complete control. As I stated in the opening of this book, the search for total control is part of the problem. I call it the “control paradox”: Once you pass a certain point, the more you try to gain control, the less control you have. This is because the process of trying to gain complete control drains so much of your time, attention, and energy that you have little left with which to exert the control you worked so hard to gain.

- The key is to find the right balance between control and lack of control. The Serenity Prayer, purportedly written by Reinhold Niebuhr and quoted widely in Alcoholics Anonymous, puts this idea well: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference. However, in today’s world I would take it one step further. It is important to accept and “let be” even some things that you could change but don’t have time to, if you want to preserve the right rhythm in your life. What sets the rhythm is up to you, of course. For some it is breakneck speed. But for most of us, it is slower than the forces that surround us, tempt us, or try to push us to go. I take the liberty here of modifying the Serenity Prayer according to my purposes in this book: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; The insight to prioritize wisely what I want to change; The patience to resist trying to control everything I could, had I the energy and time; The courage and skill to change the things I have chosen to change; And the wisdom to know the differences among all these.

For example, you may think that keeping up with your friends and making time for family dinner is most important, but you may feel afraid that if you don’t work the extra hours, you will lose your job, and if you lose your job, all is lost. Once fear starts to govern your use of time, you cease to be true to the best of who you are, and, paradoxically, you give up your chance to live a genuine life.

- Do what matters most to you. Look at the table in the previous chapter for your own assessment of what it is that matters most to you. A person’s not doing what matters most is the most common casualty of an excessively busy life. Don’t spread yourself too thin. People often head into their day like a spray, where the megaloctopus quickly entraps them. Gemmelsmerch, the force of distraction, is so powerful today that if you don’t deliberately protect time to do what matters most, it is likely you will not do it, or at best not give it the time it deserves. Focus on what you like best and on what you do best. There is not enough time to do everything you like, and there certainly is not enough time to try to get good at what you’re bad at or spend time doing what you dislike (unless you must). Technology has allowed us to do so much more than we used to be able to do that it is tempting to try to do everything we’ve always wanted to do. This will run you ragged, whether you are a child or an adult. ([Location 1901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1901))

- Cultivate your lilies and get rid of your leeches. Give yourself permission to get rid of what hinders you, whether they’re projects, people, or ideas. Yes, an idea can become a leech. Examples would be the idea that it is bad ever to get angry, or that it is bad ever to say no to a friend, or that it is bad to be different. Naming leeches for what they are takes some courage, but once you do it, and once you jettison them, you will have freed up a huge amount of time and positive mental energy. Cultivating lilies has the same beneficial effect. Once you allow yourself to spend time with projects, people, and ideas that nourish you and help you to grow, you will look forward to each day more than you do right now. Cultivating your lilies and getting rid of your leeches does not mean you become selfish. Indeed, one of the best lilies, for a lot of people, is the act of helping others. It feels wonderful and refuels the soul. Helping others is a lily, not a leech, unless you take it too far. 2.

- feel safe and secure in your surroundings, when you feel welcomed and appreciated, you think better, you behave better, you work better, and you are better able to help others. Failing to recognize this crucial fact is the chief reason so many people buckle under the busyness of modern life. When the emotional atmosphere is less than positive, people lose flexibility, enthusiasm, the ability to deal with ambiguity and complexity, patience, humor, and creativity. They become less intelligent than they otherwise are, as well as less trusting. Therefore, they become less able to cooperate, plan, delegate, organize, anticipate, participate, and perform all the other functions essential to thriving in a busy environment. 3. Find your rhythm. When you find your rhythm, you allow much of your day to be taken care of by the automatic pilot in your brain, so that the creative, thinking part of your brain can attend to what it is uniquely qualified to attend to. You find your rhythm by combining many of the suggestions in this book: creating a positive emotional atmosphere, doing what you like and do best, prioritizing your use of time and using your morning burst wisely, getting rid of leeches, and so on.

A modern addiction, screensucking is like smoking cigarettes: Once you’re hooked, it is extremely tough to quit. Denied a screen for long, a screen-sucker can have a modern variant of a nicotine fit. He can start pacing, looking for a place to log on or switch on. I see people on airplanes or in church who are clearly showing signs of screen withdrawal. They are twitching, scratching, looking around, reading something for a second, putting it down, looking at their watches, and in general feeling the pain of not being able to soothe themselves with a screen. While screensucking doesn’t carry the health risks that smoking cigarettes does, it can seriously limit a person’s productivity and mental growth. Do whatever you have to do to break the habit. While we don’t have a “… ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEIB2C&location=1931))

- your screen to a different room, or putting an alarm clock next to your screen to signal when you’ve gone past a certain amount of time, or programming your computer to beep every ten minutes, or training yourself to work for an extended period before you allow yourself a “screen break” all might help. Be creative and devise your own methods of breaking the screensucking habit. In extreme cases, professional help is recommended. I have treated more than a few cases of screen addiction. I use the same treatments used for any other addiction: some combination of psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, meditation, physical exercise and dietary changes, a 12-step program, and sometimes medication. 6. Identify and control the sources of gemmelsmerch in your environment. Gemmelsmerch, the force that distracts a person from what he or she wants or ought to be doing, is as pervasive and powerful as gravity. To get you thinking along the right lines, here is an array of potential sources of gemmelsmerch (in italics), along with possible ways to control or eliminate the gemmelsmerch: a.

Move them, look the other way when you see them, or simply tell yourself they are off limits, as an alcoholic tells himself the bar is off limits, at least until your work is done. c. Mail that is waiting to be opened. Set a fixed time to open your mail and stick to it. Unopened mail is so loaded with gemmelsmerch that it is best to keep it in another room. d. The computer screen only a chair swivel away from you. Move the screen, even into another room if you have to. It is not so bad to have to get up and walk a few paces if it will save you from wasting hours of time. e. The telephone, cell phone, BlackBerry, or Treo. Turn them off.

As a rough guideline, I would set a one-hour-per-day limit. g. An open door that allows people to pop in. Close the door when you do not want to be interrupted. Put a sign on the door that reads WORKING. AVAILABLE AT ___ O’CLOCK. h. Other items on your to-do list that beckon the moment so what you are working on now becomes difficult or boring. Recognize this as a moment to take a break. Stand up, do a quick bit of exercise (jumping jacks work well, or squats), have a glass of water, meditate for three minutes, then go back to what you were working on. Try not to allow yourself to abandon what you were doing. i. Radio talk shows. Use these judiciously. They can be addicting. From NPR to sports radio to Rush Limbaugh, you can become so attached to a show that you lose focus on what you’re doing and just listen to the show.

Use this pad to write down great ideas or stupid stuff you don’t want to forget (like, buy a quart of milk on the way home) that pop into your mind while you are working. k. Guilt. Guilt, or its modern manifestation, gigaguilt, can slow you down like a sea anchor, dragging insistently on your mind. While it is hard to reason your way out of it, it is best not to give in to it. One of my heroes, the eighteenth-century essayist Samuel Johnson, struggled with guilt for most of his life. When it hit him, it hit him hard. He would stay in bed and ruminate at length or write extended entries of self-laceration in his diaries. None of this helped; indeed, it seemed to make the guilt worse. I think the best way to deal with guilt is first to address the reasonable part of it. If you have done wrong, do your best to make up for it, apologize, make amends or restitution, whatever. Next, have a talk with yourself or, even better, someone else, regarding the unreasonable part. For example, let’s say you feel guilty that you can’t spend more time with your ailing mother.

If you can see this unreasonable guilt for what it is—an attempt to change the unchangeable facts of life—then it can become easier to let it go. But you must have worked on this in advance so when the guilt arises you will have a shorthand way of relegating it to where it belongs. l. Flirtatious or sexual fantasies. These make for some of life’s best moments. Don’t get rid of them, just try not to let them take over your whole day. If possible, when such a fantasy comes up, tell yourself you can think about that at another time, a time when you can give it your full attention. m. E-mail.

As stated above, try to adopt the motto “Do it now” and aggressively make yourself obey it whenever possible. The more you put something off, the larger it looms. q. The nagging physical symptom you can’t make sense of but don’t want to get evaluated by a doctor. A variation on the previous item, this kind of procrastination can cost you your life. It is best to get a friend to make the appointment and drive you to the doctor, if that’s what it takes. r. Money. Money distracts us all.

You may want to look at my book Dare to Forgive, in which I explain that forgiving someone merely means letting go of anger, not condoning what was done. Chronic anger is a major and toxic distraction. u. Imagined dangers. The price we pay for having an imagination is that we dream up all kinds of dangers. These days, this is not hard to do, as we are reminded of real dangers hourly. One way to deal with imagined dangers is to talk about them. This is a way of reality testing. If you are exaggerating the danger, this is a good way of finding out. And if you are not, then it will feel good to commiserate. v. Toxic worry. I have a simple 3-step plan for quelling excessive or toxic worry. Step 1: Talk to someone. Never worry alone. Connect. Step 2: Get the facts. Toxic worry usually derives from lack of information or wrong information. Step 3: Make a plan. Even if your plan doesn’t work, you will feel more in control simply because you have a plan.

Anything you can think of to get you out of what you’re doing now. When this happens, catch yourself. You are being pulled away most likely because something about the task you’re working on is bothering you. Maybe it’s boring. Maybe it’s difficult. Maybe it’s confusing. Whatever the cause, don’t leave, at least not yet. Instead of going off to the beckoning siren, take a brief break, go back to what you were working on, and see if you don’t perceive it in a different light. z.

Unfortunately, usually when you wander off you’re not aware of it until you come back. If this happens more frequently now than before, that is a sign that something is amiss.

Position one blank sheet of paper to your right and another one to your left; then, take a pencil in each hand. Draw simultaneously a vertical line on the right sheet, and a circle on the left sheet. Repeat three to five times, alternately changing figures on the right and left sheets. b. Draw a triangle with one hand and a square with the other. c. Draw a circle with one hand and a triangle with the other. d. Draw two circles with one hand and a square with the other. e. Draw two squares with one hand and a triangle with the other. f.

Draw a triangle with one hand, a square with the other, a vertical line with same-side leg as the first hand, and a horizontal line with the other leg. These are extremely difficult, aren’t they? But don’t despair. Keep Simon’s words in mind. “You can do it,” he always says to me when he sees I am about to give up. He knows what he is talking about. Do as many of these as you can do in ten to fifteen minutes. Just as if you were going to the gym, the key is to keep at it. Gradually, you will see results. Your attention will improve, as will your organizational ability and your ability to control your impulses. You may also see marked improvement in your physical coordination. The next set of exercises also promotes concentration, probably by stimulating the cerebellum, which in turn connects to the frontal lobes, the seat of concentration.

Howard read my HarvardBusiness Review article entitled “Overloaded Circuits: Why Smart People Underperform,” in which I described the damage that can be done by attention deficit trait, or what in this book I am calling the F-state. Howard was so taken by the article that he sent me the following e-mail: You have captured and made tangible a brutal battle we face every day in our information and stimulation-saturated business: how to keep our heads clear enough to actually THINK, and not just defensively react. I consider this perhaps our number-one challenge, though our young people seem hardly aware of their predicament.

I want them to become insulated from the action-oriented, short-term work and gradually become interested in becoming more original and creative than they give themselves a chance to be now.

Habits, routines, and rituals allow you to put your conscious mind in more interesting places than remembering to put coins in the meter. Mere plans don’t make a system. Plans often get forgotten or ignored. Plans that become automatic or reflexive become a system. In this book I have outlined steps you can take to develop a system, geared to who you are and the life you want to lead, so that life can become somewhat automatic, or what I call “rhythmic,” in as many ways as possible, freeing up your cerebral cortex to engage in the important activities it alone can do. 2.

Don’t let fear hold you back. The problem will only get worse. Particularly these days, when life goes so fast, it is essential to communicate often and clearly. 7. Say what you mean. Mean what you say. Don’t assume a person knows what’s on your mind without your telling him. Always ask for clarification when you don’t understand. If something is bothering you, bring it up.
