- On the other hand, is the correct number of different stocks to own in a “properly” diversified portfolio 50, 100, or even 200? It turns out that diversification addresses only a portion (and not the major portion) of the overall risk of investing in the stock market. Even if you took the precaution of owning 9,000 stocks, you would still be at risk for the up and down movement of the entire market. This risk, known as market risk, would not have been eliminated by your “perfect” diversification. While simply buying more stocks can’t help you avoid market risk, it can help you avoid another ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=81))

- kind of risk—“nonmarket risk.” Nonmarket risk is the portion of a stock’s risk that is not related to the stock market’s overall movements. This type of risk can arise when a company’s factory burns down or when a new product doesn’t sell as well as expected. By not placing all your eggs in a buggy-whip, breast-implant, pet-rock, or huckapoo-sweater company, you can diversify away that portion of your risk that comes from the misfortunes of any individual company. Statistics say that owning just two stocks eliminates 46 percent of the nonmarket risk of owning just one stock. This type of risk is supposedly reduced by 72 percent with a four-stock portfolio, by 81 percent with eight stocks, ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=86))

- 93 percent with 16 stocks, 96 percent with 32 stocks, and 99 percent with 500 stocks. Without quibbling over the accuracy of these particular statistics, two things should be remembered: 1. After purchasing six or eight stocks in different industries, the benefit of adding even more stocks to your portfolio in an effort to decrease risk is small, and 2. Overall market risk will not be eliminated merely by adding more stocks to your portfolio. From a practical standpoint, when Bob chooses his favorite stocks and is on pick number twenty, thirty, or eighty, he is pursuing a strategy imposed on him by the dollar size of his portfolio, legal issues, and fiduciary considerations, not because he feels his last picks are as good as his first or because he needs to own all those stocks for optimum portfolio diversification. In short, poor Bob has to come up with scores of great stock ideas, choose from a limited universe of the most widely followed stocks, buy and sell large amounts of individual stocks without affecting their share prices, and perform in a fish bowl where his returns are judged quarterly and even monthly. Luckily, you don’t. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=91))

- a very simple strategy. Whether they find a beautiful specimen of antique furniture at Podunk Fine Antiques & Tractor Parts or an impressionist painting from Grandma Bagodonuts’ attic, they ask themselves only one question before buying. Are there comparable pieces of furniture or paintings that have recently sold at auction (or to dealers) at prices far above the potential purchase price? It’s truly that simple, although we can probably learn more from the questions they don’t ask. They don’t ask, “Is this painter going to be the next Picasso?” or “Is eighteenth-century French furniture going to skyrocket in value?” While it would be nice and perhaps more ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=107))

- One cherished and immutable law of investing is that there is a trade-off between risk and reward. The more risk you assume in your portfolio, academics and most professionals agree, the more reward you receive in the form of higher returns. The less risk assumed, the lower the return. In short, you can’t get something (high returns) for nothing (taking low risks). This concept is so fundamental that it provides the underpinning for the investment strategies of both academics and professionals. Of course, if the discussion ended there, you could just dial up your ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=262))

- desired level of risk and receive the targeted return you deserve. In a perfectly efficient world, this relationship between risk and reward should hold true. Obviously, since you will be looking for pockets of opportunity where there are inefficiently priced investments (i.e., stocks or investment situations so far off the beaten path that analysts and investors have not priced them correctly), this immutable relationship between risk and reward should not apply. That, however, does not make the concept of risk/reward irrelevant to you. Far from it. It is perhaps the most important investment concept of all. That’s why it’s so amazing that, at least when it comes to analyzing the ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=266))

- So one way to create an attractive risk/reward situation is to limit downside risk severely by investing in situations that have a large margin of safety. The upside, while still difficult to quantify, will usually take care of itself. In other words, look down, not up, when making your initial investment decision. If you don’t lose money, most of the remaining alternatives are good ones. While this basic concept is simple enough, it would be very difficult to devise a complicated mathematical formula to illustrate the point. Then again, not much downside to that . . .

- underlying economic (that is, they generate lots of cash) and competitive characteristics. In this way, when Buffett buys a business at what appears to be an attractive discount to current value, he also benefits from the future increase in value generated by owning all or part of a business that is well situated. Graham’s statistical bargains generally do not benefit from this added kicker. In fact, according to Buffett, the risk in buying poor businesses is that much of the bargain element of the initial purchase discount may well be dissipated by the time a catalyst comes along to unlock what appeared to be the initial excess value.

Alas, although this is a worthy and not entirely unrealistic goal, life won’t always be that easy.

- events play out over a period of years, others transpire over a period of months. Your investment advantage is usually at its greatest immediately before, during and right after the corporate event or change. Your window of opportunity may be short and therefore your holding period may also be short. As there is a tax advantage for many people from receiving long-term capital gains (from investments held more than one year), and an advantage for everyone in deferring their taxable gains by not selling appreciated securities, a short holding period in some of these situations creates a disadvantage compared to the long-term strategies of Buffett, Lynch, and Graham. Fortunately, ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=398))

- you can avoid some of these disadvantages either by investing in only those situations that take several years to fully play out or by investing through your pension, IRA, or other retirement accounts. (Qualifying retirement accounts can generally be managed without concern for taxes.) One more point: although most people take comfort in crowds, this is not where successful investors generally look for good investment ideas. Nevertheless, you may take comfort in the fact that the practice of investing in companies undergoing corporate change is not an alien concept to Buffett, Lynch, or Graham. Each of these great investors has spent some time investing in this arena. It’s just that Graham was most concerned about passing on his wisdom to the individual investor; he felt accumulating a diversified portfolio of statistical bargains would be a more accessible way for most people to invest. Buffett and Lynch both had the problem of investing huge sums of money—billions of dollars. It is often difficult to take large enough positions in these special-investment situations to make an impact on that size portfolio. For your first quarter billion or so, though, it’s no problem.

- Whenever a parent company announces the spinoff of a division engaged in a highly regulated industry (like broadcasting, insurance, or banking), it pays to take a close look at the parent. The spinoff may be a prelude to a takeover of the parent company. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=810))

- One of the Ten Commandments is “Honor thy father and thy mother.” So, logically it follows that paying attention to parents is a good thing. As it happens, this same advice also seems to work well with the parents of spinoffs. Coincidence? I think not.

- As a general rule, even if institutional investors are attracted to a parent company because an undesirable business is being spun off, they will wait until after the spinoff is completed before buying stock in the parent. This practice relieves the institution from having to sell the stock of the unwanted spinoff and removes the risk of the spinoff transaction not being completed. Often institutional buying of the parent’s stock immediately after a spinoff has a tendency to drive the price up. That’s why, if the parent company appears to be an attractive investment, it is usually worthwhile to buy stock in the parent before the spinoff takes place. Although it is a little more trouble to “create” the bargain purchase by buying stock in the parent before the spinoff is completed, it is usually worth the extra effort—even if you don’t get a great price when selling the spinoff shares.

- BUY ALL RIGHTS Occasionally, instead of merely distributing the shares in a spinoff to shareholders free of charge, a parent company may give its shareholders the right to buy stock in one of its subsidiaries or divisions. One way to accomplish this is through something called a rights offering. Most rights offerings, at least the type that most investors are familiar with, do not involve spinoffs. However, on the rare occasions that a rights offering is used to effect a spinoff, it is worthwhile to pay extra close attention. Why? Come on—you should know this one by now. (Oh, all right—psst—because you can make a lot of money!) A rights offering is most commonly used when a company seeks to raise additional capital. In the usual case, rights are distributed to a company’s current shareholders. These rights, together with cash or securities, allow shareholders to purchase additional shares (usually at a discount to the current market price). By giving all shareholders the right (but not the obligation) to buy stock at a discounted price, a company can raise needed capital while giving all shareholders an equal chance to buy the newly issued stock. If current shareholders choose to participate in the rights offering by exercising their right to buy additional stock, their interests are not diluted by ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1037))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the company’s sale of new stock at a low price. Alternatively, if shareholders do not wish to purchase additional stock, they can often sell the rights they’ve received to participate in the bargain purchase on the open market. Rights that are not exercised or sold expire worthless after a set time period. Rights offerings are also unhappily familiar to owners of closed-end funds. Closed-end funds, whether equity or bond funds, are like mutual funds except that the amount of fund shares issued is fixed (e.g., 20 million shares are sold at $10 per share in a public offering and those 20 million shares are bought and sold just like a common stock). One way for a closed-end fund to raise additional capital (and thereby raise the fund manager’s advisory fees) is to issue more shares through a rights offering. As a general rule, only the fund manager of the closed-end fund benefits from this type of rights offering. But now for the good news. When it comes to the spinoff area, rights offerings can be an extraordinary opportunity for enterprising investors like you. Rights offerings are obscure and often confusing. Throw in the neglect and disinterest displayed by most institutional investors towards spinoffs, and you have an explosive combination. Generally, a parent company will distribute to its shareholders rights (free of charge) to buy shares in a spinoff. Holders of the ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1048))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- rights will then have the right to buy shares in the spinoff for the next thirty or sixty days at a fixed dollar price or for a specified amount of other securities. The rights are usually transferable, which means that shareholders who do not wish to purchase shares of the spinoff can sell their rights in the open market and investors who are not shareholders of the parent can participate in the rights offering by buying rights in the marketplace. The timing, terms, and details of each rights offering are different. The important thing to remember is this: Any time you read about a spinoff being accomplished through a rights offering, stop whatever you’re doing and take a look. (Don’t worry, they’re quite rare.) Just looking will already put you in an elite (though strange) group, but—more important—you will be concentrating your efforts in an area even more potentially lucrative than ordinary spinoffs. You won’t have to waste too much effort either. Before you get knee deep into the intricacies of a particular situation, a quick examination of some superficial aspects of the rights offering and the motives of insiders will either get you excited enough to do some more work or persuade you to spend your time elsewhere. So why does combining a spinoff with a rights offering create such a profitable opportunity? After all, the bargain element of a standard spinoff—indiscriminate selling of the unwanted spinoff stock by parent-company shareholders—is not present in a rights offering. In fact, in a rights offering almost the opposite takes place. Shareholders who use their rights to purchase shares are actually making an affirmative choice to buy stock in the new spinoff. Even the bargain element of a standard rights offering is not present in this situation. Unlike the usual rights offering, the rights do not ensure a bargain purchase. This is because, at the time of the offering, it is not known whether the spinoff will trade above or below the purchase price set in the rights offering. So where does the profit opportunity come from? The answer lies in the very nature of a rights offering. If stock in a new spinoff is sold by the parent company through a rights offering, the parent company has, by definition,… ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1057))

- parent-company shareholders and to investors who purchase rights in the open market is not usually the best way to maximize proceeds from the sale of the spinoff’s businesses. However, in a rights offering, since all shareholders of the parent have an equal opportunity to purchase stock in the spinoff—even if a bargain sale is made—shareholders have been treated equally and fairly. While there is a general tendency for a spinoff to be offered at an attractive price in a rights offering (note: investors who buy rights in the open market must add the purchase price of the rights to the offering price to figure out their total cost), examining the structure of a rights offering can give important additional clues. One telltale sign of a bargain offering price is the inclusion of oversubscription privileges in a rights offering. Oversubscription privileges give investors who purchase spinoff stock in the rights offering the right to buy additional spinoff shares if the rights offering is not fully subscribed. Since rights are obscure, require the payment of additional consideration, and usually trade illiquidly for small sums of money (relative to the value of parent-company holdings), there are often times when rights holders neither exercise nor sell their rights. In a case where rights to buy 3,000,000 shares are distributed, but rights to buy 1,000,000 shares expire unused, oversubscription privileges allow those rights holders who purchase stock in the offering an additional opportunity to purchase the remaining 1,000,000 shares on a pro-rata basis. Insiders who wish to increase their percentage ownership in a new spinoff at a bargain price can do so by including oversubscription privileges in the rights offering. In certain cases, insiders may be required to disclose their intention to oversubscribe for shares in the new spinoff in the SEC filings. The implications of this type of disclosure are obvious. Keep one more point in mind: When oversubscription privileges are involved, the less publicized the rights offering (and the lower the trading price of the rights), the less likely it is for rights holders to purchase stock in the rights offering, and the better the opportunity… ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1077))

- Contrary to popular belief (fostered by the exploits of the most infamous arbitrageur, Ivan Boesky, and numerous other insider trading scandals), risk arbitrage generally involves the purchase of a stock after a merger announcement is already made. In its simplest form, Company A announces that it has agreed to acquire all of Company B’s stock for $40 per share. Prior to the announcement, Company B traded at $25 per share; after the announcement, Company B’s shares trade at $38, not at the proposed acquisition price of $40 per share. A risk arbitrageur (fancy term for the guy who buys the stock at $38) attempts to profit from this discrepancy. Far from a riskless transaction, the arbitrageur takes on two risks. First, the deal may not go through for a variety of reasons. These may include regulatory problems, financing problems, extraordinary changes in a company’s business, discoveries during the due-diligence process (if you’ve ever purchased a home, this is sort of the house inspection of the merger world), personality problems, or any number of legally justifiable reasons people use when they change their mind.

- the event of a broken deal, Company B’s shares may fall back to the predeal price of $25 or even lower, resulting in big losses for the arbitrageur. The second risk that the arbitrageur is underwriting is the timing risk. Depending upon the type of deal and industry involved, merger deals can take from one to eighteen months to close. Part of the $2 spread made by the arbitrageur is payment for the time value of laying out $38 before the close of the deal (when the acquirer purchases all of company B’s shares at $40). One of the arbitrageur’s jobs is to assess the time required for the merger to be consummated. Over the last decade, dozens of investment firms and partnerships have entered the risk arbitrage area, once considered a backwater of the securities business. This has made risk arbitrage a very competitive business despite the large volume of mergers. The ability of these firms to follow developments in deals all day long, armed with the advice of antitrust counsel, securities lawyers, and industry-specific investment experts, makes this a very difficult investment strategy for the individual to try at home. In addition, the degree of competition keeps the spread between the stock price and the acquisition price relatively low, making risk-adjusted profits tougher to come by. Still want to play?

- other types of securities to pay for an acquisition. These securities can include all varieties of bonds, preferred stocks, warrants, and rights. Typically, these “other” securities are used as partial payment, with the bulk of the acquisition price still being paid in cash and/or stock. In many cases, the reason merger securities are used to pay shareholders of the company being acquired is that the acquirer has already exhausted its ability to raise cash or its desire to issue additional common stock. In other cases, merger securities are used as an additional “sweetener” to clinch a deal or to outbid a potential acquirer in an auction situation. As a general rule, no one wants merger securities. Like Rodney Dangerfield, they get no respect. Think about it. You’re walking along (of course, minding your own business) when all of a sudden a takeover bid is announced for your favorite company and largest stock position, Acme Potato. Seeing great synergies in a combination of the two companies, Toppings, Inc. has just agreed to purchase each of your shares in Acme for $22 in cash and $3 in face value of Toppings 9-percent bonds due in 2010. Since shares of Acme Potato had just been trading at $16, this looks pretty good to you. But when the deal closes, what are you going to do with the proceeds? Well, you know what you’re going to do with the cash—that’s an easy ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1402))

- one. You’re either going to buy stock in some other company (maybe General Potato) or have a field day buying up everything at the Home Shopping Channel. But, what are you going to do with the bonds—you know, the $3-face-value of 9-percent bonds due in 2010? (These are bonds that pay interest of 9 percent on the face value of $3 until the year 2010, when bondholders receive $3 in cash.) Well, the bonds might be a good deal. Then again they might not. The bottom line is—you couldn’t care less. When you invested your money in Acme Potato, you were interested in owning stock in a potato company, or a cheap stock, or a potential takeover candidate, or all three—not in owning 9-percent bonds issued by some other company, due whenever.

They’re going to sell their bonds—the same as you—only they’re going to do it even faster. Institutional investors who own stock in a potato company not only have no interest in the bonds of the new conglomerate; in most cases, they’re not even allowed to own them. The vast majority of pension and mutual-fund managers specialize in either stock investments or bond investments. As a general rule, they’re given a specific mandate to invest in one or the other, not both. Even if they can buy both stocks and bonds, it’s incredibly unlikely that, out of all the available choices of bond investments, the new Toppings bonds are going to head up the list.

- Just being aware that merger securities can provide extraordinary profit opportunities puts you at a huge advantage. While thousands of people will be reading the same headline, you will be focusing your attention and efforts in an area most people ignore. And, because almost everyone’s a seller, even if more people discover your little secret, there should still be plenty of merger securities to go around. That’s just the way the system works. Combine the proper focus with a little research and you can make the system work for you. As for Super Rite, just reading some of the information provided in the proxy turned out to be an excellent road map to future profits. Distributed in August, the proxy outlined the terms of the merger, including a description of the two merger securities. Of course, the $25.25 in cash was pretty straightforward. The $2 in face value of preferred stock paying 15 percent annually (or, as the proxy called it, the “Senior Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock”) was a slightly different story. What looked interesting about the preferred, though, was that each shareholder was only getting $2 face value worth for each share of Super Rite they owned. Compared to the over $25 worth of cash being paid out in the deal, the preferred would account for only a very small ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1472))

- Well, as long as everyone has a hula skirt on, let’s take a look at a knock-down drag-out takeover fight that hit the front pages for nearly six months. Luckily, the fight ended in a multibillion-dollar sea of merger securities. Despite the huge amount of press the battle for Paramount Communications received, most investors missed the biggest opportunity to profit from this highly publicized situation. In September 1993, Viacom agreed to purchase Paramount Communications for stock and cash. Viacom, a media conglomerate controlled by Sumner Redstone, was the owner of cable services (like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Showtime), cable systems, broadcast stations, and television distribution and production divisions. In what appeared to most analysts to be a good fit with Viacom, a combination with Paramount would contribute a leading producer and distributor of motion picture and television programming, a book publisher (Simon & Schuster), more cable channels, more television stations, and two sports teams. Particularly attractive to Viacom was Paramount’s extensive library of past movie and television hits as well as access to the future output of Paramount’s film and television studios. Also trying to expand his media empire, Barry Diller, originator of the Fox television network ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1522))

- and chairman of the QVC home shopping service, launched a competing bid for Paramount just one week after the Viacom announcement. After a five-month bidding war, Viacom finally prevailed, but not before significantly raising and changing the nature of its initial bid. During this period, in an effort to increase the strength of its offer, Viacom announced a merger with Blockbuster Entertainment. That merger was scheduled to close shortly after the successful acquisition of Paramount. Because of the high-profile nature of all the companies involved, and the high-powered machinations of a slew of lawyers and investment bankers, the battle made interesting reading until a winner was determined in February 1994. At that time Viacom was able to purchase, for cash, 50.1 percent of Paramount’s shares outstanding. Although the contest was over and the Paramount story faded from the headlines, the opportunity to profit from the merger had only begun. The closing of the deal would not take place until after a Paramount shareholder meeting in July 1994. Since Viacom had purchased 50.1 percent of Paramount in February, the vote to approve the merger was a mere formality. What wasn’t so formal was the method of payment for the remaining 49.9 percent of Paramount.

- stock, practically everything except cash, was the form of payment for the second half of the merger—known as the back end of the merger. Mentioned but certainly not focused on in The Wall Street Journal, the back-end payment for each share of Paramount consisted of (1) Viacom common stock, (2) exchangeable subordinated debentures of Viacom, (3) securities known as contingent value rights (one for each share of Viacom common stock received in the merger), (4) three-year warrants to purchase Viacom common stock at $60 per share, and (5) five-year warrants to purchase Viacom common stock at $70 per share. All the information about the merger and this strange collection of merger securities was provided to Paramount shareholders in a proxy statement issued in June. This information was readily available, but most shareholders had no interest in finding out what any of it meant. The vast majority of Paramount shareholders were interested in owning the shares of an entertainment conglomerate or the stock of a takeover candidate. While Viacom common stock might have been of interest to some… ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1540))

- of being retained by Paramount shareholders, was going to come under heavy selling pressure. According to the proxy document, the Viacom stock issued to the public as part of the merger consideration would nearly triple the supply of Viacom stock in public hands. Although the proxy was quite long, the sections outlining the merger securities were not very extensive. In fact, if you really wanted to answer the question “What is all this stuff?” a three-page section entitled “Paramount Merger Consideration” pretty well summed it up. Not surprisingly, each of the merger securities turned out to be pretty interesting. For instance, combining the purchase of one share of Viacom common stock with the purchase of one contingent-value right (CVR) created a unique investment opportunity. The contingent-value right was a security issued by Viacom to help guarantee the value of the back-end securities that Paramount shareholders were to receive in the merger. It was probably this guarantee of value by Viacom that was responsible for its “victory” in the bidding war over Paramount. The contingent-value rights worked in the following way: If Viacom common stock traded below $48 one year after the completion of the Paramount merger, Viacom would make up the difference through a payment to holders of the CVRs. (E.g., if Viacom stock traded at $44 on the one-year anniversary of the merger’s close, Viacom would pay $4 for each CVR; if Viacom traded at $38 at that time, Viacom would pay $10 for each CVR.) By purchasing one CVR for each share of Viacom he owned, an investor could ensure that the combined value of the two securities would be at least $48 in one year. If Viacom stock traded higher than $48—let’s say to $55—then, although the CVR would be worthless, the combined value of the two securities would be $55, even better than the guaranteed $48 price. Since, shortly after the merger was completed, one CVR and one share of Viacom stock could be purchased for a combined price of $37, a guaranteed price of $48 in one year looked pretty good—a 30-percent annual return with little risk and no upside limitation.… ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1550))

I simply read the page in the proxy that told me how they worked. However, I did have an advantage in all this. I did know something that very few other investors knew. My big advantage and what I knew was this: It pays to check out merger securities! The takeover of Paramount provided a prime example of the kind of investment opportunities that can open up by just looking in this area. Of course, contingent-value rights weren’t the only merger securities issued in the Paramount deal. A few others (actually, all the others) were worth a close look. One of the securities, the five-year warrants to buy Viacom stock at $70 per share, looked particularly interesting. These warrants gave the holder the right to buy Viacom stock at $70 per share for a period of five years. Since Viacom stock was trading at about $32 per share in July 1994 (shortly after the Viacom warrants had… ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=1569))

If you let me live just one year, I will teach the royal horse to talk.” “Sure,” responds the king, figuring what the heck, “if you can teach my horse to talk in one year, I will set you free.” On the way out of the royal palace, one of the king’s guards pulls the peasant aside and asks, “Why’d you tell the king that you could make his horse talk? When the year is up, he will surely have you beheaded!” The peasant replies, “I’m not so sure about that. A year’s an awful long time. If I have a whole year, maybe the king will change his mind. Or maybe the king will die. Maybe the horse will die. Maybe, I’ll die. Or who knows? If you give him a year, maybe the horse will talk!” So, if anything can happen in one year, just imagine what could happen to Viacom stock in five years!

- the merger. Besides, ten months earlier, Viacom stock had traded as high as $60 per share. In addition, these were merger securities, bound to be trading at a cheap price. But as impressive as all this sounds, none of these reasons were the main reason why the five-year warrants to buy Viacom at $70 looked interesting. The main reason the five-year warrants looked interesting could be found right in the three-page section describing the Paramount merger consideration. According to the proxy, the five-year warrants gave the holder the right to buy Viacom stock at any time during the next five years for $70. In the case of an ordinary warrant, this would mean that the warrant holder was entitled to receive one share of Viacom common stock in exchange for $70 in cash. But this was no ordinary warrant. In this case, the warrant holder had a choice. The $70 could be paid in cash—and there was nothing unusual about that. However, the $70 could also be paid with $70 in face value of one of the other Paramount merger securities. Which merger security?

- bought the five-year warrants to buy Viacom stock, under certain circumstances outlined in the proxy, I would effectively have the right to buy Viacom stock not for $70, but for only $42 worth of merger securities. I would have this right for five years. Viacom was at $32. The right to buy stock at $42 for five years was a lot more valuable than the right to buy stock at $70. If I hadn’t read the portion of the proxy covering merger securities, there was no way I could have known this opportunity existed. For anyone who still cares, there was, believe it or not, yet another twist. If the proposed merger between Viacom and Blockbuster was later completed (which it was), the terms of the warrants would change and the value of the exchangeable subordinated debentures would dramatically increase. You don’t want to know the details, but the bottom line was, no matter what happened, buying both warrants and debentures was a winning trade. Once again, although this may seem complicated, the particulars of this situation aren’t relevant. The important thing is that I didn’t learn any of this in school. No one told me that the Paramount merger securities had all of these weird provisions. I just knew enough to read about the merger securities in the proxy. The proxy explained how the securities worked. Most likely, the next bunch of merger securities will have totally different provisions. Just remember to read about them.

American Express, as you recall, was the parent company of a spinoff. It appeared to me that the unpredictability of the spinoff’s business, Lehman Brothers, masked the attractiveness of the parent company’s two main businesses, charge cards and financial advisory services. Purchasing these businesses at a price of nine times earnings before the spinoff took place, looked like a hidden opportunity to buy a good company at a bargain price. Because American Express owned what appeared to be good businesses, I was much more comfortable holding American Express stock for the longer term.

- One way a company can create value for its shareholders is to recapitalize its balance sheet. For a period in the 1980s, recaps, as they are known on Wall Street, were a popular way for companies to ward off the advances of a hostile takeover artist or to placate restive shareholders. Generally, in a recapitalization transaction, a company repurchases a large portion of its own common stock in exchange for cash, bonds, or preferred stock. Alternatively, cash and/or securities can be distributed directly to shareholders through a dividend. The result of a recapitalization is usually a highly leveraged company that is still owned by the original shareholders. Even though recaps are not as popular as they once were (due to the large number of excessively leveraged companies that filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980s and early 1990s), there’s still a good reason to learn about them. But, we’ll get to that later. First let’s see how a recap works. Let’s assume that XYZ Corporation is trading at $36 per share. Deciding that a recapitalization transaction will be good for shareholders, the company decides to distribute $30 worth of newly issued bonds to its own shareholders. Theoretically, if XYZ stock was worth $36 before it distributed $30 of value to its shareholders, then after the distribution, the market should value the common stock at approximately $6 per share—and if that was all that happened, recaps would be no big deal. But it’s not that simple. In practice, recaps tend to create additional value for shareholders for a number of reasons. One reason is that there is a tax advantage to having a leveraged balance sheet. Let’s assume that, prior to the recap, XYZ earned $3 per share after taxes—for a price/earnings ratio of 12 based on its $36 stock price. The tax rate, including state taxes, is assumed to be 40 percent, so pretax earnings for XYZ are actually $5 per share ($5 in pretax earnings less $2 in taxes equals our $3 per share in after-tax earnings). Now let’s see what happens when we leverage up the balance sheet through the recap. If the $30 of bonds distributed to shareholders carry an interest rate of 10 percent, then XYZ will owe $3 in interest on the bonds each year. Since interest is a tax-deductible expense for corporations, the new pretax earnings ([Location 2019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2019))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- for XYZ Corporation will now come to $2 per share (the $5 of previous pretax earnings less the $3 per share in interest expense). Assuming the same 40-percent tax rate, this $2 in pretax earnings will net out to $1.20 per share after tax. Thus, if the common stock of XYZ after the recap (usually referred to as the stub stock) were to trade at only $6, the price/earnings ratio would be down to 5. That’s usually much too low. Of course, the stub stock probably doesn’t deserve the same twelve-times-earnings multiple that XYZ commanded before the recap. After all, the greatly increased debt load raises the risk to investors in XYZ common stock—and since investors like to get paid for taking on additional risk, the stub stock should trade at a lower earnings multiple.

- low? It’s no science, but a new price/earnings ratio of 8 or 9 wouldn’t seem unreasonable. This would leave the stub stock trading at around $10 (for a P/E of 8.33), resulting in a total value for the recap package of about $40 per share ($30 in debt plus a $10 stub) versus the original pre-recap price of $36. Does this result make sense? XYZ’s assets haven’t changed. The sales and earnings power of the business are the same. Where does the $4 gain to shareholders come from, anyway? Isn’t this recap stuff just a bunch of smoke and mirrors? You know, what they call financial engineering? Well, not… ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2040))

- in the form of taxes. After the recap, $3 goes to shareholders in the form of interest payments on the newly distributed bonds and an additional $1.20 goes to shareholders in the form of earnings on the stub stock. That’s a total of $4.20 going to shareholders versus just $3 before the recap. Uncle Sam’s cut, as a result of the recap, is just $0.80—down from $2 before the recap took place. No smoke and mirrors. Leveraging the balance sheet (but not overleveraging it) just turns out to be a more tax-effective way to distribute earnings to shareholders—and that’s definitely worth something. Of course, you’re not going to hear about the recap until after it’s already been announced in the papers. So much of the $4 gain created by the recapitalization transaction will already be reflected in XYZ’s stock price before you get a chance to invest. Still, recaps can provide ample opportunity to profit. For instance, in recap situations where debt or preferred securities are distributed directly to shareholders, the profit opportunities can be similar to those available through investing in merger securities. Investors who owned the common stock of XYZ generally don’t want the company’s debt and preferred securities. Consequently, shortly after being distributed these newly issued securities are often sold indiscriminately. But, you know this story already—and anyway, it’s the other part of the recap story that can get really exciting. That part involves investing in the stub stock—the equity stake that remains after the company has been recapitalized. This is where you can make the big money. Essentially, investing in a stub stock is just like investing in the equity portion of a publicly traded leveraged buyout. Many leveraged buyouts have returned five or ten times the original equity… ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2046))

- lucrative? The answer is pretty straightforward: it’s all in the numbers. While we have previously discussed the various benefits and risks of investing in leveraged companies, reviewing the math, once again, can only help to highlight the opportunity. In our example, let’s assume that XYZ’s pretax earnings improve 20 percent, increasing from $5 per share to $6. Assuming no recap, a 40-percent tax rate will take after-tax earnings to $3.60 per share. At a multiple of 12 times earnings, XYZ stock will move from $36 to $43.20 per share, for an increase of 20 percent. Assuming XYZ goes through with the recap, the story looks a little different. Using the assumed increase in pretax earnings to $6, and subtracting the $3 of interest payable on the bonds distributed in the recapitalization, we come out with $3 in taxable income. After paying 40 percent in taxes, the after-tax earnings of XYZ’s stub stock work out to $1.80 per share. Using the same multiple as earlier (8.33 times earnings), XYZ’s stub stock is now worth $15—up 50 percent from the original stub price of $10. Taking it a step further, now that XYZ’s pretax earnings exceed its interest expense even more comfortably than in the original scenario, the stock may be viewed as less risky. A price/earnings ratio of 10 might now seem reasonable. Therefore, the stub stock could actually trade to $18 per share (10 times $1.80 in earnings), or an 80-percent gain from the original $10 price. Once again, this potential 80-percent gain was made possible by a relatively modest 20-percent increase in pretax earnings. As you can imagine, when they work, leveraged recaps can be both fun and profitable. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, nowadays investors don’t have many opportunities to invest in the stub stocks of recapitalized companies. For the moment, at least, recaps are out… ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2062))

So a June call to buy IBM at $140 per share gives the owner of the call the right to buy IBM at a price of $140 per share until the call expires in June (the third Friday of each month is considered the expiration date for listed options). If at the expiration date IBM stock is trading at $148, the call would be worth $8. This is because the right to buy stock at $140, when the stock can be immediately resold for $148, is worth $8. If, on the other hand, IBM stock is trading at only $135 on the call’s expiration date, then the call expires worthless. This is because the right to buy stock at $140 (usually referred to as the strike or exercise price) isn’t worth anything if everyone can just go out into the marketplace and purchase the same stock for $135.

We already know that, if it were the third Friday in June, these IBM calls would be worth $8. In April, however, these calls are worth more than $8. They’re more likely to be trading closer to $11,375. Why? There are really two reasons. First, the owner of the calls doesn’t have to lay out $140 for another two months, yet he is entitled to all of the stock’s appreciation until June. Think about it. If IBM stock were to ([Location 2145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2145))

- gain another $10 per share by June expiration, then IBM would be trading at $158. The owner of stock (since April) would have a gain of $10 on his $148 investment. On the other hand, if the IBM June $140 calls could be purchased for only $8 in April, then the owner of an $8 call option would also make $10 in the same two-month period. (That’s because, on the expiration date, the owner of the call could purchase stock at $140 and sell it for $158; after subtracting the $8 initial cost, the profit would be $10.) This result wouldn’t be fair. After all, the owner of the stock laid out an additional $ 140 for the same amount of profit. The owner of the call received the upside in IBM’s stock without having to invest an additional $140.

So, in addition to what’s known as the intrinsic value of the call—the amount by which the call is already in the money (in our example, the difference between the market price for IBM of $148 and the exercise price of the call of $140, or $8)—an imputed interest rate for the amount of money the call buyer didn’t have to lay out for the two months is also included in the call… ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2156))

The buyer of the call can only lose the amount of money invested in the call. While this doesn’t sound all that great, when you compare it to owning the common stock of IBM, it is.

- and options, the two types of securities differ in one important way. Options have a limited life; they only have value until their expiration date. Stub stocks are common stocks so in some sense, they are really like calls without an expiration date (although the stub stock may become worthless as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding). It is this unlimited life that makes stub stocks so attractive. That’s why buying LEAPS, which are merely long-term options, can be an attractive way to emulate a stub stock investment. While LEAPS don’t have an unlimited life like stub stocks, they can usually be purchased up to two and a half years before they expire. This often gives ample opportunity for the stock market to recognize the results from an extraordinary corporate change (like a spinoff or restructuring) or a turnaround in fundamentals (like an earnings gain or the resolution of an isolated or one-time problem). Additionally, two and a half years is often enough time for many just plain cheap stocks either to be discovered or to regain popularity.

At the very least, being able to compare the risk/reward of a stock with the opportunities available through an investment in the related LEAPS will provide you with another good investment choice. How much money can you make investing in LEAPS? Plenty. But don’t take my word for it. Seeing is believing. So let’s take a peek at what the potent one-two… ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2204))

- If you liked LEAPS, in some ways warrants are even better. A warrant gives the holder the right to buy stock at a specified price for a set period of time. While similar to call options, warrants ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2305))

- differ in two ways. First, warrants are issued by the underlying company. So, five-year warrants to buy IBM stock at $82 per share allow the holder to purchase stock directly from IBM at any time during the next five years at a price of $82. In contrast, listed call options represent contractual arrangements between investors to buy or sell a particular stock; the underlying company is not involved. The second difference between typical call options and warrants should be of more importance to you. At the time they are issued, warrants usually have a longer time-to-expiration than typical call options. Like LEAPS, warrants can extend for a period of years. Though LEAPS usually extend for no more than two and a half years, the expiration date ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2306))

- for newly issued warrants can be five, seven or even ten years away. (Some perpetual warrants—with no expiration date—have actually been issued.) As with LEAPS, the investment merits of the underlying stock are the main basis for making a warrant investment. Given the benefits of leverage and “protection” offered by warrants over such an extended period of time, it is usually… ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2311))

- Warning: This section is for advanced students only (although compulsive gamblers are also welcome). The option markets can present special-situation investors with an opportunity to make spectacular profits from a little-known market inefficiency. This is true even though for over two decades elaborate computer models have been continually developed and refined to calculate the correct theoretical values for every conceivable type of option (including LEAPS and warrants). Given the amount of professional and academic firepower directed toward the study of options and other derivative securities (securities created to emulate or react to the movements of… ([Location 2318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2318))

- extraordinary corporate change, special-situation investors have a huge advantage over the high-powered quants (read “computer-wielding eggheads,” or more accurately “rich computer-wielding eggheads”). This is because, in many cases, option traders (including the quants) view stock prices as simply numbers—not as the prices of shares in actual businesses. In general, professionals and academics calculate an option’s “correct” or theoretical price by first measuring the past price volatility of the underlying stock—a measure of how much the price of the stock has fluctuated. This volatility… ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2324))

- academics and professionals to value options.) The formula takes into account the stock’s price, the exercise price of the option, interest rates, and the time remaining until expiration, as well as the stock’s volatility. The higher a stock’s past volatility, the higher the option price. Often, however, option traders who use these formulas do not take into account extraordinary corporate transactions. The stocks of companies undergoing an imminent spinoff, corporate restructuring, or stock merger may move significantly as a result of these special transactions—not because… ([Location 2329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2329))

- be no surprise, then, that this is where your opportunity lies. Depending upon how large or how important a spinoff is relative to the parent company, the stocks of spinoffs and parent companies can move dramatically after a spinoff is completed. Since the date of distribution of spinoff shares is announced in advance, knowing this information along with some fundamental information about the underlying companies involved can give you a large edge over option traders who invest “by the numbers.” One strategy would be to buy options that expire several weeks to several months after… ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2334))

- holding back on purchasing the parent’s stock until the divestiture of the unwanted business was completed. So, too, the spinoff stock’s price could be a source of surprise during this initial trading period simply because it is a new stock with no trading history and no underwriter to set an expected price range. The bottom line is that the options markets can be a profitable place to exploit your research efforts in the spinoff area. Specifically, you can apply both your knowledge of when a spinoff is scheduled to take place and your fundamental understanding of the underlying companies involved.… ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2340))

- timing of crucial events in an ongoing program can help you choose the appropriate option expiration date for a call or put position. In many cases, the date of a significant distribution of cash or securities or the target date for the sale of assets can correspond to a significant price move in the underlying stock. In merger situations, where a portion of the acquisition price is paid with common stock, it is the closing date of the merger that can be the catalyst for extraordinary stock price moves.

Only once the merger is completed is this source of selling pressure on the acquirer’s stock usually relieved. Also, in the weeks immediately after the closing of a merger, those shareholders who had not already sold their shares when the merger was announced tend to sell the shares they received in the acquirer’s company. This is usually because the original investment in the target company’s shares was made for reasons specific to that company—reasons not applicable to the… ([Location 2350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043RSJB8&location=2350))
