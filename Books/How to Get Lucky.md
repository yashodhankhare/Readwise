- It isn’t enough just to be good. You’ve got to be lucky, too. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=50))

- What is it you want from life? To be rich? Famous? Respected in a profession? Happily married? Well loved? Whatever your goals may be, have you achieved them? It is unlikely you would be reading this book if your answer were yes. Nearly all of us would have to answer no, we have not yet achieved our goals. And why not? Apply the question to your own life. What is it that has prevented you from getting where you want to be? Is it that you aren’t good enough? Or simply that you haven’t been lucky enough? The second answer – not lucky enough – is by far the more likely to be the truth. Most of us are “good” in one way or another – good enough, as often as not, to reach whatever goals we have wished to set for ourselves. We have failed to reach those goals largely because of a lack of luck. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=57))

- But you can bring about a substantial and even startling improvement in the quality of your luck. You can turn it from mostly bad to mostly good, from pretty good to better. Wherever you need luck and have been seeking it – in investments, gambling, career, love, friendships – you can upgrade your chances of becoming one of life’s winners. I know this is true because I’ve seen it happen. The luck-changing precepts you are about to study – the thirteen techniques of lucky positioning – are not just wisps of gassy theory. They were not invented by a bearded shrink sitting in his study, puffing on his pipe. Instead, they are derived from direct observations of men’s and women’s lives. The lucky and the unlucky: What are the differences between them? What do the lucky know, what do they do, that the unlucky don’t? Are they lucky because they have some special ways of handling life or because – well, just because they’re lucky? I’ve been pursuing the answers to these questions for more than twenty years.

- Life is like that much of the time: completely random and meaningless. Not only college English professors but all the rest of us are uncomfortable with that fact. But it is a fact you must look square in the eye if you want to do something about your luck. The first step toward improving your luck is to acknowledge that it exists. That brings us to the First Technique of Lucky Positioning. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=164))

- Ignoring the role of luck is a recipe for bad luck. In fact, the tendency to make this mistake is one of the most notable characteristics of the chronically unlucky: life’s losers. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=310))

- But when you clearly see how luck affects a given situation, then you become strongly aware that the situation is bound to change. It can change radically, rapidly, without warning, in unpredictable ways. You cannot know what the change will be or when it will happen, but you can be perfectly sure it will happen sooner or later. The one thing you cannot expect is the very thing the loser does expect: continuity, a repetition of yesterday’s events. The loser’s problem lies in the inability to make the crucial distinction between planning and luck. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=311))
    - Tags: [[luck]] 
- Either way, the unlucky mental process is the same. The process begins when a good result occurs once or a few times. The loser studies it, ascribes it to planning, and concludes that the same planning will produce the same result in the future. And the loser loses again. The lucky personality avoids getting trapped in that way. This isn’t to say he or she avoids taking risks. Quite the contrary, as we will see later. What it does mean is that the lucky personality, entering a situation and perceiving it to be ruled or heavily influenced by luck, deliberately stays light-footed, ready to jump this way or that as events unfold. The lucky approach is to say to yourself, “Okay I’m going to get into this risky situation-this roulette game, this mutual fund investment. But I am not operating under the delusion that planning will make it turn out my way. I see luck looming large in it, so I will be careful not to let myself grow too confident and relaxed. I will expect rapid change. I won’t make large, irrevocable commitments. I’ll stay poised to bail out the minute I see a change I don’t like.” ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=317))

- There are of course many kinds of ventures in life that are not as heavily influenced by luck as are gambling and stock market investments. Planning may be more important than luck in much of what you do. The trick is to know what kind of situation you are in at any given time. Can you rely on your own or others’ planning, or will the outcome be determined by luck? ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=326))

- It is essential to arrive at some idea of this ratio in the important ventures of your life. Your career, your marriage if you’re in one, your investments. Obviously, you won’t be able to arrive at precise numbers: 57% planning, 43% luck. To attempt that would be silly. But you can develop a general awareness of luck’s relative influence in your life’s various situations. It may not be precise, but it is bound to be useful. In studying the more complicated of your life situations – career and marriage, for example – you are likely to find that luck’s influence is larger than you ever allowed yourself to believe. Finding this out can be a shock. But cheer up. The very act of finding it out can automatically improve your luck.

- With this reminder constantly in front of him, he prepared for the day when his luck might change in unknowable ways. The day might never come, but he acted always as though it would be tomorrow. Even when his career seemed to be going just right, even when he could have been feeling unassailably secure, he refused to let himself relax. He continually explored possibilities for other jobs. He questioned friends who worked for other companies. When an executive recruiter approached him with a feeler involving a job in Europe, he didn’t turn the man away with a “No, I’m happy where I am.” Instead he went out of his way to befriend the recruiter, made a point of re-establishing contact with the man once or twice a year. “I always knew exactly what I’d do if my job disappeared,” he recalled. “I knew just what phone calls I’d make, what letters I’d write. I even looked into the Forty-Plus Club. Most people don’t do that until after they’ve been kicked out in the street. I did it while I was still employed and feeling secure.” Finally, it happened to him again; he lost his job. He says little about the cause, except that it involved a costly error of judgment made by a senior executive. The blame sifted downward and landed on the shoulders of Wendell Osborne, now in his late forties. It was the kind of bad luck that can hit anybody in a business organization. It was unpredictable. But in a way Osborne had predicted it. He had kept telling himself his luck could change. And when it did change, he was ready. The normal length of stay in the Forty-Plus Club is about three months. Wendell Osborne had three job offers within two weeks. The job he accepted came with a nearly 50% increase in salary.

- The lucky personality looks outside as well as inside. Admittedly that isn’t always easy to do, for it argues with some of our most cherished old Work Ethic preachments. We are told in school, in church, and in management-training seminars that we are the shapers of our own lives and the authors of our own outcomes. But you should not believe it. It is nonsense. The first step in controlling your luck is to recognize that it exists. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=419))

- The power of seemingly weak links between people is one of the less well understood phenomena of human society. We know a lot about the strong links – more than we want to know, sometimes. Psychiatrists and psychologists eternally study sex, love, family ties, close friendships (and later in this book, we will study a special kind of friendship call destiny pairing). But what of the weak links? We don’t pay much attention to them, though they may exert the most profound influence on our lives. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=501))

- A social science team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology once estimated that the average American is directly in contact with as many as five hundred people. This total includes strong as well as weak links, and it also includes extremely flimsy contacts – for example, your nodding acquaintanceship with some of the checkout cashiers at your local supermarket. These people recognize your face and enjoy chatting with you about the weather or food prices. You aren’t a stranger, but that is about as far as it goes. They don’t know your name or anything else about you, so it is hardly plausible to imagine that they might some day bring you a lucky break of any consequence. For purposes of our studies of luck, we won’t include those very flimsy contacts in our definition of “weak links.” A better definition was developed once by a Harvard-funded psychologist, Dr. Stanley Milgram. He was interested in what psychologists call the “small-world phenomenon” – the often astonishing way in which people’s networks of weak links overlap. You meet a total stranger on an airplane, strike up a conversation, and discover, to your amazement, that you both know the same person. “Yes, it’s a small world!” you agree. It certainly is, and Dr Milgram determined to find out just how small. His studies are directly relevant to our studies of luck. When you have a clear appreciation of how very small this “small world” of ours really is, you will be in a better position to understand why getting into the fast flow can bring a startling improvement in luck. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=509))

- In considering networks of person-to-person contacts, Dr Milgram included both strong and weak links. But he excluded the very tenuous contacts such as a nodding acquaintanceship with a supermarket cashier. He was interested only in contacts in which there was “some meaningful, personal interaction”; and he defined those as contacts with people you now on a first-name basis. That is as good and quick a definition as any. Those are the “weak links” we are talking about: people you know on a first-name basis but would not classify as close friends or family. Dr Milgram picked a “target person” at random: a woman who lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was married to a divinity student. Then he picked a small group of “starting persons” in Wichita, Kansas. Wichita was chosen at random, and so were the so-called starting persons. Each starting person got a letter from Dr Milgram. It said, in effect: This is a study of the “small-world phenomenon.” Enclosed is a document addressed to a lady living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. If you know this lady on a first-name basis, please see that it gets to her. If you don’t know her, please pass it along to somebody whom you know on a first-name basis and who, in your judgment, might know her.

- The object of this odd exercise was, of course, to see how long a chain of weak links would be needed to get back to the target person. Dr Milgram asked people to guess how long the shortest chain would be. Most thought it would be one hundred links or more. To Dr Milgram’s own astonishment, one chain completed itself in three links. A farmer in Wichita – one of the original “starting persons” – passed the document along to a minister friend. That man sent it to a minister he knew in Cambridge. The Cambridge minister knew the target woman, and the chain was finished. Of the chains that were completed, the longest had ten links, and the median number was five. A startling result. Yet it becomes less startling when you look at the mathematics of it. Let’s suppose you have first-name contacts – strong and weak links – with three hundred people. Let’s further suppose that each of them has an average of three hundred links. This means that your secondary links-friend-of-a-friend-would total some ninety thousand people. And your tertiary links-friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend-would total twenty-seven million. With numbers like that, it is not surprising that the median chain in Dr Milgram’s experiment had only five links. By getting to know only three hundred people, you become a member of an… ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=530))

- We noted before that a mere nodding acquaintanceship – “Hi, how are you? Some weather, huh?” – is too weak a link to be thought of as a potential conduit for the flow of luck. It will be useful, to ask in what way it is too weak. Principally, in one way: the other person doesn’t know enough about you. The kinds of luck that this Second Technique is concerned with – the breaks that flow to a target person along linked chains of people – cannot easily reach a target who is only a face seen in a supermarket. To be singled out as a lucky target, you must make something of yourself known to those who are your primary links in the network. These can still be what we’ve called “weak” links, but they must be at least strong enough so that people know who you are, what work you do, what your interests are, what kinds of rewards you look for in life. It is necessary for them to know what you would consider a lucky break. An appealing fact about our sometimes unappealing species is that, with exceptions, we enjoy bringing each other lucky breaks. We like to be the bearers of good tidings. In the words of Eric Wachtel, the consultant recruiter: “It really is very pleasant to pick up the phone and say, ‘Hey, Charlie, there’s a job opening that sounds as if it might be your kind of thing.’ ” But before people can target you for that kind of benign treatments, they must know what it would take to make you happy. As Wachtel puts it, “If I’m trying to fill a certain job, naturally I’ll go to people I know about or people I can find out about. There may be a lot of other good candidates around, but if they keep themselves hidden, obviously, their phones are never going to ring.” Your phone starts to ring when you feed the basic facts about yourself into the network.

- Go where events flow fastest. Specifically what does that mean? It means, simply, make contact with people. Get involved. Don’t be a sideliner, watching events flow past. Plunge into the events yourself. At work, counsels Eric Wachtel, go out of your way to make yourself known in your own company and outside it. Go to meetings, even boring ones. Join employee after-hours groups. Seek work assignments that will force you out beyond the little knot of people you usually associate with-your “home clump,” as Wachtel calls it. And all the time, make your career goals known to those you meet. In off-the-job life, be just as much of a meeter and joiner. As Wachtel says, it isn’t necessary to try to be the local popularity king or queen. You can’t fake vivacity. The tinny quality is quickly detected; the effort is tiring; and in any case, it isn’t called for. If you’re a quiet person, then be quiet. All that is necessary is that you meet a lot of people and let them know just who you are. Group activities are ideal: glee clubs, political advocacy groups, whatever your interests may be. If you are wedded to a solitary pursuit such as stamp collecting, at least try to get involved in clubs and conventions devoted to the hobby. Also, go to parties. Give parties. Attend rallies. March in marches. If you exercise for fitness, don’t exercise alone; join the Y. Consistently lucky people are nearly always to be found in the fast flow. I never met one who was a recluse or even reclusive. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=593))

- stick your neck out. You cannot control the kind of luck that will come your way. It may be good luck or bad. If it is bad, there are steps you can take to get out of its way. We will study those steps later in the book. For now, the point to understand is that if you want luck to come around and change your life, you must initially be willing to accept either good or bad luck. That is another way of saying you must take a risk. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=634))

- But all that stuff about getting rich by hard work, thrift, and fortitude was nonsense, and deep down in his heart, Jean Paul Getty knew it. “It was really luck, wasn’t it?” I challenged him one day in a mischievous mood. He replied in mock alarm, “You’ve found me out!” Then he said, soberly, “Well, maybe. Luck. But who ever admits it was luck? How can you make a sermon out of luck?” ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=740))

- One of Louise’s difficulties evidently was that she lacked skill in assessing the risk-reward ratio in her life’s important situations. Either that, or she didn’t understand the need to make such an assessment. All risks looked equally daunting to her. That is a recipe for poor positioning in the world of luck. It is essential to study risk-reward ratios. When ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=807))

- a given risk is small and a potential reward large, you might as well take the risk and so position yourself to become a winner. A risk may be “small” either in terms of its size or in terms of the odds against you. A simple example of a small-sized risk is a bet in a state lottery. You plunk down a dollar. The odds against you are huge. In all likelihood you are going to lose that dollar. But since it is so small an amount, and since the potential six- or seven-figure prize is so big, you can justify taking the risk. As Lula Aaron noted, you can justify it on the basis of fun alone.

- What really seems to drive such a risk craver is not a desire to lose but just the opposite: a desperate yearning for the experience of a big win. It must be a big win: a twenty-to-one shot at the track, a stock market gamble that pays off in six figures. Modest successes aren’t enough for the risk craver. He is like a heroin addict who started by injecting small amounts of the drug, got hooked, built up a tolerance, and now cannot get a kick except from large amounts. Studies at Johns Hopkins University bear out this conclusion. At the university’s Compulsive Gambling Counseling Center, staff members say they have never noticed any widespread “wish to lose” among their patients. Nor have they identified any special personality type as particularly prone to this problem. But according ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=863))

- to project administrator Sandra Leavey, there are “common threads” in the lives of many of the patients. Two of these common threads are worth looking at. First, the risk accepted as a positive experience. The youngster went to the racetrack with Dad or heard a favorite aunt talk about the fun to be had in Las Vegas. And second, the risk craver had a big win early in his or her gambling or speculating career. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=868))

- But statistically, if you feel good luck has been avoiding you, it is far more likely that you lean in the direction of too little risk taking rather than too much. What you must do is learn the technique of risk spooning. From now on, seek out risks. Start small. The very least degree of risk you should expose yourself to is the degree associated with a typical state lottery, in which tiny amounts are bet against long odds in the hope of monumental rewards. If your state runs a lottery, bet a couple of bucks once in a while. Or place a bet when you visit a neighboring state.

- Always assume a given run will be short. You will virtually always be right. The law of averages is heavily on your side. The simplest way to illustrate this is to calculate the mathematics of probability in tossing a coin. If you toss it 1,024 times, the odds are there will be one long run in which heads comes up nine times in a row. But there will be thirty-two short runs in which heads comes up four times in a row. Which is the way to bet? On the short runs, of course. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=943))

- In Monte Carlo once, red is supposed to have come up twenty-eight times in a row. The story may be apocryphal, but it is not inconceivable. Long runs, including fantastically long runs, do happen. But the point to keep in mind is that they happen rarely. If you insist on waiting for them, the strain on your gambling capital is going to be too great. You will go broke before your long run happens. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=970))

- One of the oldest and wrongest pieces of advice you hear around Wall Street is “Cut your losses but let your profits ride.” There is nothing wrong with the part about cutting loses. Indeed, we’ll study that under the Fifth Technique: luck selection. But the last half of the old adage, the part about letting profits ride, is a recipe for bad luck. Of course Wall Street is not a roulette wheel. If you are playing rouge ou noir and let your profits ride, you stand to lose everything instantly when the wrong color comes up. Runs of luck do not end so abruptly when you are speculating in stocks, real estate, rare coins, or other changeable-price entities that may attract you. They may end quite abruptly if you are heavily margined, that is, you finance your speculations with a lot of borrowed money. But if you are an ordinary cash speculator like most people, a downturn in the price of your stock or gold bullion won’t necessarily bring total disaster. You don’t lose your whole wad. You lose only the value off the top. With that in mind, the old dictum about letting profits ride might sound like acceptable advice. You’ve bought a bundle of stock, we’ll say. The company, Gee Whiz, is a manufacturer of doodads, thingamabobs, and other useful products, which your broker believes will sell well during the next twelve months. He shows you a lot of portentous-looking economic analyses to back up his view. So all right, you decide to take a chance and load up on Gee whiz stock at ten dollars a share. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=987))

- By sheer blind luck, your broker and his economic analysts turn out to be right. The stock price advances to fifteen dollars. You are in on a run of luck. What should you do? “Let your profits ride,” solemnly counsels the fellow across the hall at work. This chronic loser is so consistently unlucky that he can’t even get out of a Friday night poker game without leaving all his pocket cash behind. He never had any profits and doesn’t really understand what it might mean to let them ride. But he does have all the clichés committed to memory and can recite them in appropriately businesslike tones. So you think: All right, I’ll take the advice and ride this run of luck as far as it wants to take me. I’ll ride it to its very peak! And when it tops out, I’ll take my profit and run. That is what you think. It sounds logical, and it sounds easy. It sounds particularly easy to the fellow across the hall, who never actually did it. The fact is, however, that it is damnably hard. Indeed, for the majority it is so hard that it effectively is impossible. What happens is that, having signed on for a long run, you work yourself into a psychological state in which nothing else will do. You trap yourself into waiting for the long run, which, nine times out of ten, isn’t going to happen. Very few people ever make money consistently on Wall Street, and my observations convince me this is one the main reasons why, if not the reason. Beginners come into the market, hear that silly advice about letting profits ride, attempt to carry it out, get flattened, and finally withdraw in weary discouragement. They end up with their money in savings accounts and money market funds – which, as we’ve seen, is no way to get lucky. The losing process typically begins with what could be a modest win or even a pretty good one. You’re sitting there with your handful of Gee Whiz stock, which you bought at ten dollars a share. It jumped to fifteen dollars, then to twenty dollars. You’ve doubled our money! You really ought to be out of the game by now, but you’re operating on the basis of letting profits ride. You have your sights set on a long run of luck. Maybe the price will go to thirty dollars, you think hopefully. You’ll have tripled your money! Unfortunately, the bottom drops out of the thingamabob market, and the price plunges back to fifteen dollars. You think: “This must be the end of the dip. It would be a mistake to sell out now and risk getting left behind. Suppose it quadruples? I’ll kick myself!” It doesn’t quadruple, it sags to ten dollars, the price you paid for the stock. Now you’re furious. You feel cheated. “I’ll be damned if I’ll let go of this now!” you tell yourself. “This stock owes me! I’m going to hang on until it pays off!” So it collapses to five dollars. And that is how losers are made. Bernard Baruch, a supremely lucky man, cut a lot of runs by selling all his stocks in the middle of a thundering bull market in 1928.

- The unlucky, by contrast, are always getting themselves stuck – sometimes for life – in bad relationships and losing money ventures. They typically complain that fate has dealt them bad hands, but that usually isn’t the problem. The unlucky receive no more bad hands, but that usually isn’t the problem. The difference is that the unlucky don’t have the knack of selecting luck. Incapable of discarding a bad hand, they can only sit and suffer while bad luck becomes worse luck.

- One reason why luck selection is so difficult for most people is that it almost always involves the need to abandon part of an investment. The investment may be in the form of time, commitment, love, money, or something else. Whatever it is, you leave some of it behind when you discard a bad hand. You buy a stock at one hundred dollars, and the price abruptly drops to ninety dollars. In the absence of compelling reasons to think the sag will reverse itself, you probably ought to cut your loss and sell out immediately. Only by doing that can you free your money to seek better luck in another investment. The problem is that the act of discarding this bad luck will require you to abandon part of your original one hundred-dollar investment. If you sell, you leave ten dollars behind.

- For some, that is so hard that it is impossible. The unlucky investor talks himself out of it. “Things aren’t as bad as they look! The price will go back up!” So he hangs on. The price drops to eighty dollars. Now he’s stuck twice as hard. If he couldn’t abandon ten dollars, how is he going to abandon twenty dollars?” He is mired in his bad luck. Instead of having his money out chasing better luck elsewhere, he has allowed it to get trapped, perhaps for years. Two psychiatrists, Stanley Block and Samuel Correnti, studied the “born loser” and reported on this unhappy breed in the book Psyche, Sex and Stocks. They found that the inability to abandon part of an investment is one of the loser’s outstanding traits. Leaving part of oneself or one’s money behind is an experience that troubles everybody to some extent, but the chronic loser is troubled more than other men and women. The affliction is crippling. Unless the loser overcomes it, he is all but certain to remain a loser – and a loser not just in the investment world. This kind of person will get taken to the cleaner’s in a poker game, for example. To be lucky in this game you must discard bad hands when you get them. This always means that you must leave some of your money behind in the pot, and it hurts – but you must do it or go broke. The loser cannot bear to do it. Instead, this unlucky player gets stuck with whatever unplayable hands fate and the dealer want to hand out. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1055))

- In our studies of the Fourth Technique, run cutting, we noted that lucky people often seem to behave in a pessimistic way when dealing with runs and streaks of luck. Instead of hoping for long runs, they expect only short ones. They habitually jump off before runs have reached their peaks. Similar pessimism seems to be involved in luck selection. If an optimist buys a stock at one hundred dollars and it drops to ninety dollars, he is unperturbed – or at least pretends to be. “Oh, I don’t care!” he says cheerfully. “The price will go back up! Everything will turn out all right in the end!” In the same situation, a pessimist is more likely to pick up the phone, call his broker and sell out. Paradoxically, the pessimist’s approach is more often the lucky one. The pessimist, habitually bailing out when hit with a 10% to 15% price drop, may suffer a string of small losses while waiting for a big gain. But he has two major advantages over the optimist. First, the pessimist can never get caught in a major crash. And second, he can never get his money stuck in a situation of long-term stagnation. There are many speculators – in stocks, commodities, currencies – who sell out automatically on a 10% to 15% price drop. Such programmed selling appeals to some but not to others. Whether it is for you will depend on your temperament. However, it works only in the case of a speculative entity having a precisely known market price. There are many other areas of life and luck, of course, in which it isn’t possible to arrive at such precise valuations; what is the value of a job? A love affair? How can you tell when its “price” has dropped 10%? You cannot, of course. But you can tell when it has begun to turn sour. And when that happens, you can make use of the same healthy pessimism that serves the lucky speculator. But now we had better pause and agree on what we mean by “pessimism.” As used here it doesn’t refer to a state of chronic gloom, a long face, or a habit of expecting only bad things to happen. The kind of pessimism that characterizes the lucky is really a fairly cheery state. As we’ve noted before, “pessimism” may not be exactly the right word. “Realism” might be a little better. To define it as precisely as possible as it applies to the Fifth Technique, it is the habit of avoiding unfounded optimism. Unfounded optimism is dangerous. On Wall Street, it is a killer. It is the habit or tendency to expect things to turn out well, even when there is no tangible reason to expect any such thing.

- The lucky approach is to insist on seeing such evidence. Let’s say you’re in a career situation that has turned sour. Promises made when you were hired haven’t been kept, or your mentor has retired early, or the company president’s nephew has been moved in over your head. Bad luck has hit you. The “price” of the job has fallen. What do you do? The unlucky optimist would cling to empty hope. “Things are bound to get better! I’ll give it time. It’ll all work out. Maybe it’s all for the best. Things are never as bad as they seem!” As a lucky realist, you would look at the situation differently. You would recognize, in the first place, that things usually are as bad as they seem. In fact, often they’re worse. You would say to yourself, “I’m willing to be optimistic, but I’ve got to be shown some reason why.” And then you would study the situation. Is there some likelihood that the problems will go away? Or do you have some realistic hope of fixing them? If so, stay aboard. If not, get out and go looking for better luck elsewhere.

- “A superstition won’t do you any harm as long as you don’t use it as a substitute for thinking,” said Charles Goren, the bridge master. He was talking to a group of reporters and was responding to a question about bridge superstitions, specifically the one about bathtubs. “In fact, a superstition can help you. If it makes you feel good to sit facing in a certain direction, then probably you’ll play better. You’ll get up from the table with the feeling that you improved your luck.” The feeling would almost certainly be accurate. In bridge as in life, your fate is influenced by events beyond your control, particularly by the way the cards fall in the deal. You are stuck with the hand you pick up: 13 cards not of your choosing. But these 13 strokes of luck, good or bad or ho hum, are not the sole determinants of your fate. The game’s outcome will also be influenced by what you do with the luck you are handed. With a good superstition to help you take risks and make data-short decisions, you are likely to be luckier than if you simply sat there baffled and discouraged.

- We are now in a position to ask a question that has baffled amateur gamblers for centuries: Why do professionals usually win? “Because they cheat,” is the cliché reply, but the truth is that professionals – meaning men and women who earn all or a substantial part of their income by gambling – are far less likely to cheat than amateurs are. Cheating would be foolish for a pro. The pro doesn’t need to take that extra risk. Professional gamblers win because they reject optimism. They apply the Fifth Technique: the trick of selecting luck, of abandoning any venture rapidly when it turns sour. And they apply the Eighth Technique: the trick of worst-case analysis. The amateur gambler hopes or prays the cards will fall his way. That is optimism, and it doesn’t win card games.

- Calvin Coolidge, our twenty-ninth president, was noted for his habit of keeping his thoughts to himself. People called him “Silent Cal.” Some – particularly those who didn’t like his conservative, business-oriented political leanings – suggested that the reason why he didn’t say much was that he didn’t think much. But it is most unlikely that that was true. The evidence is that Calvin Coolidge, a man who enjoyed uncommonly good luck all through his life, understood or intuitively felt that unnecessary talk can become a barrier against lucky breaks. As we’ve noted many times in this book, our paths through life are determined to a great extent by events not of our making, which is our definition of luck. We cannot control the flow of these events nor predict what they will be. But we can know that they are going to occur.

- The trouble with too much talk is that it can constrict that valuable freedom and flexibility. Talk can tie you up, lock you into positions that seem right today but may be wrong tomorrow. “I have often regretted my speech, but never my silence,” wrote Publilius Syrus, a Roman author of mimes and aphorism who flourished in the first century B.C. He may have been referring simply to the morning-after regret that has been familiar to men and women through all the ages: “Oh God, did I really tell that story?” But it is more likely Publilius was thinking about the kind of regret that seizes you when an unexpected shift of events leaves you stranded. “I’ve never like Marie much,” you confide to a group one day. The next day, in one of those unpredictable shifts, Marie finds herself in a position to direct a lucky break your way. Why didn’t you keep your mouth shut? “I wouldn’t work for that… ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1516))

They reveal no more of their thinking than they have to.

The more he saw, the less he spoke. The less he spoke, the more he heard. Why can’t we be like that old bird? Great poetry it wasn’t.

- People liked silent Cal, and in this fact lies one lesson of the Ninth Technique: You don’t have to have your mouth going all the time to establish a circle of good friends and a widespread acquaintanceship network. As a matter of fact, in a talky time such as the present, people often find silence pleasantly surprising and refreshing. You can make friends as easily by listening, really listening, as you can by generating great heaps of words. Indeed, nonstop talk can irritate people – especially those who wish to be nonstop talkers themselves. People not only liked Coolidge but were intrigued by the mystery of the man. What was he thinking? Nobody knew, except on the rare occasions when he chose to tell them. And because of this frugality with words, he preserved the freedom to react flexibly to unexpected events and turn them into strokes of good luck. The event that hurled him to national prominence was a strike by the Boston police in 1919, while he was Massachusetts governor. Coolidge had never talked much about his views on unionization of public employees. When the threat of a strike boiled up suddenly, he warned the union leaders that he would not tolerate a police walkout, but they chose not to believe him. It was a serious miscalculation. To their astonishment, the inscrutable governor threw the full weight of his authority against the strikers – and, still worse for them, made a national issue of it by deliberately getting into a public debate with Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor. “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time,” Coolidge declared flatly, and the majority of the U.S. press and public cheered. From that moment on, Calvin Coolidge was on his way to the presidency. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1560))

- It was a fine example of how to seize an unexpected event and turn it to good fortune. Coolidge was able to do this because he had kept himself free. He had not done a lot of talking. He had not aligned himself unnecessarily with groups and positions, only to find that he had to do a lot of wiggling to get free. When the potentially lucky event occurred, he was free. The event required that he take a position, and he did – unequivocally. He locked himself into that position for the rest of his life. He was willing to do this when it was necessary – but only when it was necessary. And so it went throughout Coolidge’s career. He avoided making enemies when there was no good reason to do so. In 1920, when he had his first shot at the presidency, his nomination was impeded by the powerful Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and Coolidge ended up as vice president under Warren Harding instead. A less lucky man might have made a life long enemy out of Lodge by losing his cool and firing off a salvo of angry words.… ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1573))

- since there was no good reason to reveal them. And since he did not utter the words that may have been in his mind, they did not come back to haunt him. In one of those unexpected twists of events that fill human life but that only the lucky are prepared for, Lodge found it expedient to support the idea of a Coolidge presidential candidacy in 1924. He could not easily have done so, and Coolidge could not easily have accepted the support, if they had been enemies. Both would then have been accused of shallow opportunism. As it was, Lodge was able to offer generous support, and he lived just long enough to learn of Coolidge’s landslide victory in the 1924 election.

Americans themselves had trouble believing what was happening to them, and as for European and Russians they watched in pop-eyed amazement. Business boomed. Factory wages in America soared to more than twice what could be had anywhere in Europe and six times what could be earned in the worker’s paradise, Russia. The stock market went wild.

- It is a central assumption of modern psychology that talk is the cure for all ills and the route to all private and public heavens. Sigmund Freud was one who held this unlikely belief. He taught that if you are troubled, you can get cured by lying on your back, gibbering to a shrink. Neither he nor any of his disciples ever offered trustworthy evidence that this is true, but the idea caught the imagination of the Western world. Today the volume of doctor-endorsed talk is vastly greater. Mass-media shrinks like Dr. Joyce Brothers assure us over and over again that “communication” is the key to mariital bliss, sexual ecstasy and whatever else one might want. In her books and magazine articles on these topics, Dr. Brothers has couples making lists. Lists of what they like and dislike. Lists of why they’re mad, lists of why they’re sad. And then they read these lists and they talk, talk, talk. Part of the rationale is the century-old assumption that it is bad for us to “bottle up” your feelings. If you’re angry you are supposed to open the valves, let off the steam and reduce the pressure. Shrinks have been asserting this, without proving its correctness, ever since Freud’s day and particularly in the very talky era that began in the 1960s. If you accept the analogy that men and women are vessels filled with steam under pressure, the assertion may make a goofy kind of sense. But the fact is that it is almost certainly untrue. Studies at Cornell University and elsewhere have demonstrated, in fact, that the reverse is true. People who “bottle up” their anger – in other words, control it – don’t come to any great harm. People who habitually vent their anger, on the other hand, only get angrier. They get angrier largely because they continually stir up their environment. By lashing out at people, they provide angry… ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1611))

- It is unlikely that talk would have been of any more help in Coolidge’s private life than in his public one. He and Grace were not in the habit of “communicating” a great deal, and the idea of making little lists would have amused them. Yet their marriage was so serene that it deeply moved Howard Chandler Christy, a painter who lived at the White House while working on the first lady’s portraits. Historians learned years later that silent Cal was not faithful to his wife. There is no conclusive evidence to tell us whether Grace knew about this and didn’t care, knew about it and elected to ignore it, or didn’t know about it. Perhaps she, too, was unfaithful outside the marriage. Nobody knows for sure. What can be said for sure is that talk could not have improved the situation in the slightest and might have made it very much worse. It was a silent and uncommunicative marriage, but in its way, it worked. What would have been the sense of destroying it with talk? Silence doesn’t only protect you from getting locked into unwanted positions, and it doesn’t only keep you from revealing facts and feelings you may not want known. It has one other great virtue. By avoiding excessive communication, lucky men and women are freed of the need to explain and justify actions to other people. Other people’s opinions can tangle you and slow you disastrously. Typical sad story from Wall Street: The chronic loser buys some stock and blabs to his or her spouse, explaining all the reasons why this investment is so nifty. Bad luck obtrudes. The stock price plunges. This is the time when the speculator ought to apply the Fifth Technique, luck selection.

Then, when action is required, the only person you must argue with is yourself. That is often tough enough.

But around 1980, many PWP members seem to have come to feel that the dogma was overrated. Some, indeed, arrived at the conclusion that it was plain rubbish. “What earthly good is it going to do to discuss my private life and feelings with my kids?” one woman wrote. “To the extent that my divorce directly affects their lives, they’re entitled to hear from me.

He and she got into the habit of doing things as a couple. She then started inviting him to traditional family gatherings such as Christmas dinner. Finally, he suggested that their sexual and financial convenience could both be served by his moving into her apartment and sharing the rent. She gave a detailed account of this progression to her son and daughter. It was a mistake, for in doing so she gave away her freedom to act in her own best interest.

On the other hand, the mother did have a comfortable middle-class income and nest egg. This was more than the ex-teacher seemed to have. Unwilling to let her son and daughter think she had any doubts about this man in whom she had invested so much, the mother went along with his suggestion and invited him to move in with her.

But she had invited other people’s opinions into her life. Those opinions had begun to push her in directions she might not have chosen if she had been free. It got worse. By bad luck, the ex-teacher had a heart attack soon after moving in with her. It was not serious, he recovered fast. But it was expensive, and it worsened his already bad financial condition. He was unable to pay his share of the rent or even contribute much to the food budget. The woman, through her job, was enrolled in a group health insurance program that would have paid for the man’s illness had he been her spouse. It would not pay for a nonmarital partner, however. For this and other reasons, the ex-teacher began to talk about their getting married. She was now beginning to feel some of the doubts expressed by her daughter. The man was charming, but was he just looking for a free ride? With these doubts mounting, she should have cut her losses, abandoned her investment, and withdrawn from the venture long ago. But she could not make herself say “I was wrong” – particularly to her son and daughter. She talked herself into hoping for the best and, then, into believing the best. She talked herself into optimism – a dangerous state of mind, as we’ve seen in other contexts. She married the man. It turned out disastrously. The man was not only broke; he was up to his ears in debt. His creditors now began dunning his new spouse. The total of their demands was more than her life savings. The marriage disintegrated under the strain. Eventually the ex-teacher ran off with another woman, leaving his wife a good deal poorer and,… ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1676))

- Nonlessons, all of them. It goes back to the First Technique, learning how to make clear distinctions between luck and planning. When outcomes are brought about by random events that are not under anybody’s control – events that we would define collectively as luck – then you must be very careful in determining what lessons may be drawn from them. The habit of deriving false lessons from life’s random happenings is a trait of the unlucky. Nonlessons often grow out of unwarranted generalizations. A certain kind of event happens a few times in association with a certain kind of person, and you make a sweeping generalization to include all people of that kind. Many feminists, for example, are women who, by bad luck, have had several unhappy experiences at the hands of men. The generalization: “All men are untrustworthy.” Or “All men are rapists at heart.” Similarly, any divorced men are bitter toward all of the opposite sex. “Never trust a woman. You give her half a chance, she’ll steal everything you’ve got.” It may be your bad luck to encounter such an individual at some time in your life. It may even be your worse luck to have your life affected by more than one. But if that happens, it will be important not to derive a misleading lesson from the experience. Recognize that you have received a nonlesson. You have learned nothing except that bad luck happens. ([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1715))

- Taking that kind of false lesson seriously may or may not do you grave harm. In the wrong circumstances, it can cripple you. If you withdraw from the fast flow because of a couple of unhappy experiences, you may achieve your purpose of shielding yourself against bad luck; but you also shield yourself against good luck. Another kind of nonlesson, just as common but less obvious, comes from the belief that history is going to repeat itself. People who hold this belief believe, as a corollary, that you can learn detailed lessons for the future by studying the past. All kinds of otherwise smart people subscribe to this peculiar dogma. They enjoy quoting pithy statements on the topic: “Those who persistently fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it.” This statement has been variously attributed to several nineteenth-century statesmen, who in turn may have plagiarized it from somebody still earlier. It’s clever, but is it true? Unfortunately, no, except in the most vague and general way. History simply does not repeat itself. Why should it?

- And it is the same in your personal and financial life. Certainly, there are some lessons that can be derived from past experience – very useful lessons, at times. You can often judge an individual’s future behavior, for instance, by consulting the record: How did he or she behave in similar situations in the past? This accumulation of knowledge about an individual is the basis of trust, without which human life could not work at all. The more “history” you collect on the men and women who play important roles in your life, the more you trust them (or don’t trust them, as the case may be). These historical lessons about individuals aren’t infallible, but they turn out right often enough to be a useful and ubiquitous part of our daily dealings with each other. But beware history’s nonlessons. A Merrill Lynch account executive tells of a customer who had what he thought was an infallible system for trading in gold. The customer had gone back through years of records and painstakingly compiled a detailed history of important ups and down in the yellow metal’s market price. He carefully noted what else was happening in the financial world at the times of gold’s major price swings. And from this exhaustive history, he derived what he called “indicators” of price moves to come. Just before the market price of gold posted a major gain, he noted, the stock markets was always in a slump, though utility stocks were up; bond yields were zigzagging in a certain pattern; residential housing sales were recovering from a dip; and so on. To make money in gold, he determined, all he had to do was wait until all or most of his indicators clicked into place, then buy.

- The theory, of course, was that history was going to repeat itself. “He had beautiful charts and tables” the Merrill Lynch man recalls wistfully. “It sure looked like it ought to work.” Unfortunately, it didn’t work. You can often predict what one individual will do, but only in rare circumstances can you predict what a lot of people will do. The market price of gold, or any other fluid-priced speculative entity such as real estate of stocks, is the end product of millions of people’s feelings, thoughts, and actions, all churning together and reacting one against another. The factors determining that end product, the price on a given day, are so many and so staggeringly complex that they are entirely beyond anybody’s ability to control or predict. The situation, in other words, is one on which the dominant influence is luck; and when any piece of history is influenced by luck to that extent, it cannot be expected to repeat itself reliably. The man with the infallible gold trading system had not realized this. He had combed through history in the hopes of picking up useful lessons: “This and this and this are things that happen before the price of gold goes up.” ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1753))

- What he got was a nonlesson. True his indicators had preceded a gold price jump several times in the past. But why? No reason, just luck. Pure, random chance had made history repeat itself, or seem to. Was there a good reason to believe it would happen that way in the future? No, there was none. The man bet a lot of money on some gold-mining stocks at what he judged was the right time. It turned out to be the wrong time. The stocks’ prices sagged. He might have saved himself if he had been master of the Fifth Technique: luck selection. But he didn’t have that technique to help him either. Several years later, he is still waiting to get his money back. How can you tell whether a historical outcome was caused by luck or by something more reliable, such as a person’s character? One good way is to ask whether there are clearly visible links of cause and effect. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003XRDBYY&location=1763))

- One way in which unlucky people commonly do this is to punish themselves for their own bad luck, thus, making it into worse luck. They get themselves stuck on a down-spiraling slide, sometimes stuck for life. I learned of an unusually stark example of this syndrome while studying some life-story material dealing with my college classmates.
