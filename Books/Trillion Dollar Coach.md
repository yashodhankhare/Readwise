## Highlights
- In our previous book, How Google Works, we argue that there is a new breed of employee, the smart creative, who is critical to achieving this speed and innovation. The smart creative is someone who combines technical depth with business savvy and creative flair. These people have always existed, but with the advent of the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, and all their attendant innovations, they can have a much greater impact than ever before. For companies to be successful, they must continually develop great products, and to do that they must attract smart ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=310))

- creatives and build an environment where these employees can succeed at scale. As we were researching this book and talking to the dozens of people Bill had coached in his career, we realized that this thesis misses an important piece of the business success puzzle. There is another, equally critical, factor for success in companies: teams that act as communities, integrating interests and putting aside differences to be individually and collectively obsessed with what’s good for the company. Research shows that when people feel like they are part of a supportive community at work, they are more engaged with their jobs and more productive. Conversely, a lack of community is a leading factor in job burnout.10 ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=314))

- In this book we will examine both what Bill coached—what were the things he told people to do—and how he coached—what was his approach. We break the what and how into four sections: how Bill got the details right in management skills ranging from one-on-one and staff meetings to handling challenging employees; how he built trust with the people he worked with; how he built and created teams; and finally, how he made it okay to bring love into the workplace. Yes, you read that correctly: we said love. Where relevant, we refer to a selection of the many academic studies and articles that support Bill’s techniques. Both the what and the how may seem so simple at first that they are practically aphorisms. But, as any experienced leader knows, they may be simple in concept, but they are hard in practice.*16 ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=370))

- Bill was a delightfully profane man. He used the F-word the way people today use like, almost as if it’s a new part of speech, not verb, adverb, adjective, pronoun, or noun, but a word of its own category. Jonathan once sent Bill a study he had found showing that swearing in the workplace enhances morale. Bill’s uncharacteristically understated response: “A good one for me!”* But as Pat Gallagher put it in his eulogy, “Somehow when Bill did it, it didn’t seem like swearing.” He continued, “We’ll see now what God thinks. Bill’s been up there in heaven for a week now . . . is it possible for the Lord to take his own name in vain?” Pat tells us that when, shortly before his passing, Bill asked Pat to ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=393))

- She added a bit more wisdom for the first-time CEO: “Bill, your title makes you a manager; your people make you a leader.”* Bill took that to heart. He once sent a note to a valuable manager who was struggling, counseling him that “you have demanded respect, rather than having it accrue to you. You need to project humility, a selflessness, that projects that you care about the company and about people.” ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=468))

- IT’S THE PEOPLE People are the foundation of any company’s success. The primary job of each manager is to help people be more effective in their job and to grow and develop. We have great people who want to do well, are capable of doing great things, and come to work fired up to do them. Great people flourish in an environment that liberates and amplifies that energy. Managers create this environment through support, respect, and trust. Support means giving people the tools, information, training, and coaching they need to succeed. It means continuous effort to develop people’s skills. Great managers help people excel and grow. Respect means understanding people’s unique career goals and being sensitive to their life choices. It means helping people achieve these career goals in a way that’s consistent with the needs of the company. Trust means freeing people to do their jobs and to make decisions. It means knowing people want to do well and believing that they will. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=497))

- When Brad Smith took over as CEO of Intuit, Bill told him that he would go to bed every night thinking about those eight thousand souls who work for him. What are they thinking and feeling? How can I make them the best they can be? Ronnie Lott says, when talking about two coaches he worked closely with, Bill Walsh and Bill Campbell: “Great coaches lie awake at night thinking about how to make you better. They relish creating an environment where you get more out of yourself. Coaches are like great artists ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=519))

But that’s what coaches do. It’s what Bill Campbell did, he just did it on a different field.”* “What keeps you up at night?” is a traditional question asked of executives. For Bill the answer was always the same: the well-being and success of his people. IT’S THE PEOPLE THE TOP PRIORITY OF ANY MANAGER IS THE WELL-BEING AND SUCCESS OF HER PEOPLE.

- Failure to make a decision can be as damaging as a wrong decision. There’s indecision in business all the time, because there’s no perfect answer. Do something, even if it’s wrong, Bill counseled. Having a well-run process to get to a decision is just as important as the decision itself, because it gives the team confidence and keeps everyone moving.

- This is consistent with the King Arthur round-table model of decision making that Bill described to Brad Smith when Brad became CEO of Intuit.

But the other two times you need to make the hard decision and expect that everyone will rally around it. There isn’t a head of that table, but there is a throne behind it.

- LEAD BASED ON FIRST PRINCIPLES So how do you make that hard decision? When you are a manager trying to move your team toward making a decision, the room will be rife with opinions. Bill always counseled us to try to cut through those opinions and get to the heart of the matter. In any situation there are certain immutable truths upon which everyone can agree. These are the “first principles,” a popular phrase and concept around Silicon Valley. Every company and every situation has its set of them. You can argue opinions, but you generally can’t ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=713))

- argue principles, since everyone has already agreed upon them. As Bill would point out, it’s the leader’s job, when faced with a tough decision, to describe and remind everyone of those first principles. As a result, the decision often becomes much easier to make. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=717))

- MANAGE THE ABERRANT GENIUS Perhaps one of the most difficult problems facing managers is what to do with the diva, the person who’s a star performer but a pain to work with. We have certainly come across many of these people during our careers in high-tech, and Bill always reminded us that managing these people is one of the bigger challenges of the job. He called them “aberrant geniuses,” and said, “You get these quirky guys or women who are going to be great differentiators for you. It is your job to manage that person in a way that doesn’t disrupt the company. They have to be able to work with other people. If they can’t, you need to let them go. They need to work in an environment where they collaborate with other people.” So how do you do this? Over the years, through lots of trial and error and with a lot of advice from Bill, we learned this particular art. Support them as they continue to perform, and minimize time spent fighting them. Instead, invest that energy in trying as hard as possible to coach them past their aberrant behavior. As long as you can do this successfully, the rewards can be tremendous: more genius, less aberrant. “He has everything that he needs,” Bill once wrote Jonathan about one of his problematic team members. “Now that you fully supported him, you should try to get him to behave as a leader. He has all of his space. No more arguments.” In our experience, aberrant geniuses can be enormously valuable and productive. They can build great products and high-performing teams. They have quick insights. They are simply better in many, many ways. And they can have both the ego and the fragility to match their outsized talent and performance. They often put a lot of energy into personal gains at the expense of peer relationships. A me-first attitude sometimes creeps through (or barges in), which can cause resentment in others and affect their performance. Here is where the art of balance comes in: there is aberrant behavior, and there… ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=752))

- to this, but there are a few warning signs. All of these are coachable, but if there’s no change, they shouldn’t be tolerated. Does the aberrant genius break team communications? Does he interrupt others, or attack or rebuke them? Does he make people afraid to talk? Does the aberrant genius suck up too much management time? It’s hard to know when an aberrant genius’s behavior has become too toxic for the team to bear, but if you are spending hours upon hours controlling the damage, that’s a good sign it’s gone too far. A lot of that time is usually spent arguing with the person, which is rarely constructive. One time Bill was coaching a Google manager about an aberrant genius on the team, and he summed up the situation neatly. “I don’t know why I’m defending him,” Bill noted, “except that his brilliance is one of the things that makes us great. How can we capture the good and dismiss the bad? You can’t be with him eighteen hours a day!” The eighteen-hours-a-day comment was an overstatement, but not a huge one; the person was requiring an inordinate amount of management damage control. He eventually left… ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=771))

- above the team. This often crops up in areas that are adjacent to the core work of the group. The genius will continue to shine in the job, be it sales, product, legal, and so on. But when it comes to factors such as compensation, press, and promotion, this is where the aberrant pops up. Does the aberrant genius seek too much attention and self-promotion? Bill wasn’t a fan of media attention and mistrusted the motivation of people who sought too much of it. Publicity is fine if it’s in the service of the company, and indeed, that is part of the CEO’s job. But if you are the CEO and someone on your team is consistently seeking coverage, that’s a warning sign. Aberrant geniuses may nominally give credit to their teams but still hog the spotlight. This can have a corrosive effect. People may say it’s okay, but over time they start to resent that one person seems to get a lot of credit and other, more humble, people, less. Seeking attention is one trait of narcissism, and a 2008 study demonstrates that, controlling for other factors, narcissists are more… ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=782))

- MONEY’S NOT ABOUT MONEY Bill helped advise us on compensation issues at Google for many years, and he always advocated generosity. He understood something about compensation that many people do not: the money isn’t always about the money. For sure, everyone needs to be paid a fair salary that affords them a good lifestyle. For a great many people, the money is about the money. But it’s also about something else. Compensation isn’t just about the economic value of the money; it’s about the emotional value. It’s a signaling device for recognition, respect, and status, and it ties people strongly to the goals of the company. Bill knew that everyone is human and needs to be appreciated, including people who are… ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=797))

- “The purpose of a company is to take the vision you have of the product and bring it to life,” he said once at a conference. “Then you put all the other components around it—finance, sales, marketing—to get the product out the door and make sure it’s successful.” This was not the way things were done in Silicon Valley, or most other places, when Bill came to town in the 1980s. The model then was that while a company might be started by a technologist, pretty soon the powers that be would bring in a business guy, with experience in sales, marketing, finance, or operations, to run the place. These executives wouldn’t be thinking about the needs of the engineers and weren’t focused on product first. Bill was a business guy, but he believed that nothing was more important than an empowered engineer. His constant point: product teams are the heart of the company. They are the ones who create new features and new products. The ultimate objective of product teams is to create great product market fit. If you have the right product for the right market at the right time, then go full steam ahead. Eddy Cue, an Apple executive who helped create the App Store, recalls that when he first presented the concept of the store to the Apple board, Bill quickly grasped the bigger picture of how important it was. It seemed to some like it was something that was merely nice to have, but Bill realized its immense potential. “Others were asking nuts-and-bolts questions about how it worked,” Eddy says, “while Bill’s questions were all about how we can move faster.” This was a constant theme from Bill and something he preached to us and others: if you have the right product for the right market at the right time, go as fast as you can. There are minor things that will go wrong and you have to fix them quickly, but speed is essential. This means that finance, sales, or marketing shouldn’t tell the product teams what to do. Instead, these groups can supply intelligence on what customer problems need solving, and what opportunities they see.*20 They describe the market part of “product market fit.” Then they stand by, let the product teams work, and clear the way of things that might slow them down. As Bill often commented, “Why is marketing losing its clout? Because it forgot its first name: product.” Bill liked to tell a story about when he was at Intuit and they started getting into banking products. They hired some product managers with banking experience. One day, Bill was at a meeting with one of those product managers, who presented his engineers with a list of features he wanted them to build. Bill told the poor product manager, if you ever tell an engineer at ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=826))

- Bill’s perspective on boards starts with this observation: the CEO manages the board and board meetings, not the other way around.*23 Board meetings fail when the CEO doesn’t own and follow her agenda. That agenda should always start with operational updates: the board needs to know how the company is doing. That includes financial and sales reports, product status, and metrics around operational rigor (hiring, communications, marketing, support). If the board has committees, for example to oversee audit and finance or compensation, have those committees meet ahead of time (in person or via phone or video conference) and present updates at the board meeting. The first order of business always needs to be a frank, open, succinct discussion about how the company is performing.

- Perhaps the most important currency in a relationship—friendship, romantic, familial, or professional—is trust. This was certainly true with Bill Campbell. If Bill didn’t trust you, you didn’t have a relationship with him. But if he did trust you, and vice versa, that trust was the basis for all other aspects of the relationship. Trust is of course important for any relationship, but in most business relationships it takes its place alongside other factors: personal agendas, mutual exchange of value. For Bill, trust was always first and foremost; it was sort of his superpower. He was great at establishing it, and once established, he was great at honoring it. In one of the last times they saw each other, Bill told Alan Eustace, “You know I would do anything for you.” He meant it, because of the trust between them. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=962))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A slew of academic research bears out what Bill intuitively knew—not just that trust is important, but that it is the first thing to create if you want a relationship to be successful. It is the foundation. For example, a highly cited 2000 study from Cornell University discusses the correlation between task conflict (disagreements about decisions) and relationship conflict (emotional friction) in teams. Task conflict is healthy and is important to get to the best decisions, but it is highly correlated with relationship conflict, which leads to poorer decisions and morale. What to do? Build trust first, the study concludes. Teams that trust each other will still have disagreements, but when they do, they will be accompanied by less emotional rancor.2 ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=991))

- Jonathan instantly, and regrettably, replied: “It depends on the coach.” Wrong answer. “Smart alecks are not coachable,” Bill snapped. He stood up to leave, interview over, as it dawned on Jonathan that he had heard Eric Schmidt was getting coaching from someone and, oh my God, this must be the guy. Jonathan switched from smart-aleck mode to groveling mode, backing away from his quip (which wasn’t exactly a quip), and asked Bill to continue the conversation. After another moment that felt like minutes, Bill sat back down and talked about how he chose the people he was going to work with based on humility. Leadership is not about you, it’s about service to something bigger: the company, the team. Bill believed that good leaders grow over time, that leadership accrues to them from their teams. He thought people who were curious and wanted to learn new things were best suited for this. There was no room in this formula for smart alecks and their hubris. Bill then asked, “What do you want to get out of a coach?” This felt like, and indeed was, a change-your-life-forever moment. And Jonathan couldn’t think of anything to say. Finally and fortunately, in what football fans might call a Hail Mary play, he remembered a quote from Tom Landry, who coached the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys for twenty-nine years, a stint that included ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=1030))

It worked. Jonathan not only got the job, he got the coach he didn’t think he needed, but sorely did. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=1040))

They shade the truth to conform to their BS, which makes the BS even more dangerous.” Perhaps this intolerance came from Bill’s football days.

- Academic studies point out that there is a “compensation effect” between warmth and competence: people tend to assume that people who are warm are incompetent and those who are cold, competent.1 This of course was not the case with Bill; as Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, “He’s that great combination of a sharp mind and a warm heart.” But when Jerry Kaplan first met Bill at GO, he assumed he was just a “rough and tumble . . . middle-aged man.”2 Which means that you should lead with warmth, but know that you might have to work just a bit harder to build your reputation for competency.

We’ve all been conditioned and trained to separate our personal emotions from the business environment. We all want to hire people with passion, but only in the business sense, of course, lest the lawyers and HR people get concerned. So what happens, what we live with daily, is an existence where our human selves and working selves are practically separate beings. But not Bill. He didn’t separate the human and working selves; he just treated everyone as a person: professional, personal, family, emotions . . . all the components wrapped up in one. And if you were one of his people, he cared about you fiercely and genuinely. “When Bill walked into the office at Benchmark, it was like a party arriving,” Bill Gurley says. “He’d walk around greeting people by name, hugging them.” After the hugs and greetings, he would talk about families, trips, friends. Bill was a coach of teams and a lover of people. What we learned from him is that you can’t be one without the other.

Jesse recalls that story through a combination of laughter and tears, then he notes something we heard a few times in our conversations about Bill. The ranting, the getting in his face over a crappy website, “came from a place of love,” Jesse says. “The concept of male love is something people aren’t used to talking about. When he is yelling at you, it’s because he loves you and cares and wants you to succeed.” John Donahoe calls it, with appropriate… ([Location 1845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=1845))

We care about them, but we check all but the most sanitized feelings at the door when we walk into the office. Bill taught us to do the opposite. Bring it in!

- In this book, we have explored how Bill approached his role as a coach of teams. He insisted on management excellence and hammered home the importance of simple practices that add up to a strong operation. He believed that managers who put their people first and run a strong operation are held as leaders by their employees; these managers don’t assume leadership, they earn it. He had a thoughtful and consistent approach to communications. He prized decisiveness; strong managers recognize when the time for debate is over and make a decision. He appreciated “aberrant geniuses,” those strong performers whose behavior can stray outside the norm, but also advocated moving on quickly if their behavior endangers the team. He believed that great products and the teams that create them are at the core of a great company. Everything else should be in service to that core. He knew that sometimes managers need to let people ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076ZHG3H3&location=2209))

He understood that relationships are built on trust, so he prioritized building trust and loyalty with the people he worked with. He listened completely, was relentlessly candid, and believed in his people more than they believed in themselves. He thought that the team was paramount, insisted on team-first behavior, and when faced with any issue his first step was to look at the team, not the problem. He sought out the biggest problems, the elephants in the room, and brought them front and center, ensuring they got looked at first. He worked behind the scenes, in hallway meetings, phone calls, and 1:1s, to fill communication gaps. He pushed leaders to lead, especially when things were bleak. He believed in diversity and in being completely yourself in the workplace. He loved people. He brought that love to communities he created or joined. He made it okay to bring it into the workplace.

As he told Ron Johnson, CEO of Enjoy, after Ron had stepped down from his CEO job at JCPenney in 2013, “If you’ve been blessed, be a blessing.” Bill was a blessing. When asked about his habit of eschewing compensation, Bill would say that he had a different way of measuring his impact, his own kind of yardstick. I look at all the people who’ve worked for me or who I’ve helped in some way, he would say, and I count up how many are great leaders now. That’s how I measure success. We interviewed more than eighty great leaders in working on this book, all of whom credit Bill with playing a major role in their success, and there are more we missed. Bill’s yardstick is looking pretty good. We hope that in reading this book you have picked up some principles on how to be a better manager and coach.
