- He believed in Francis Bacon’s dictum that money makes a good servant but a bad master—in Keynes’ formulation, money’s merit lay solely in its ability to secure and maintain the conditions allowing one to “live wisely and agreeably and well.” Like economics itself, money was a mere expedient, nothing other than “a means to the enjoyment and realities of life,” and moneymaking little more than an “amusement.” ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=190))

- In August 1906 he sat for the nationwide Civil Service examination, where he placed second overall. Ironically, his worst mark was in economics, prompting Keynes to remark that “the examiners presumably knew less than I did.” ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=270))

- Defeated by the tedium of the job, Keynes resigned from the India Office in June 1908 and returned to King’s College, where he submitted a dissertation on probability—according to one newspaper, “a thesis on mathematics so advanced that it was said that only three people on earth could understand it.” He was elected to a fellowship in March 1909 and, although having no formal qualifications in the subject, taught economics and finance at Cambridge. Keynes became a polished and popular teacher, with some lectures—particularly those relating to the stock exchange—drawing capacity crowds.

- Less than two years later, his first book, Indian Currency and Finance, was published and Keynes became a member of the Royal Commission on Indian Finance—a prestigious appointment for someone not yet thirty years of age.

- On his thirty-sixth birthday, June 5, 1919, and as the Treaty of Versailles was being finalized, Keynes resigned in protest at the “Carthaginian peace” to be imposed on the vanquished nations. Freed from the constraints of the Civil Service, he produced in only a few months a withering critique of the Conference. The Economic Consequences of the Peace, published in December 1919, was a sensation—translated into eleven languages and selling over 100,000 copies in its first full year of publication. The book was celebrated as much for its bravura portraits of key Conference participants as for its political and economic arguments. Keynes depicted the American President Woodrow Wilson as a “blind and deaf Don Quixote” who “like Odysseus . . . looked wiser when he was seated,” and the French leader Georges Clemenceau as a xenophobe with “one illusion—France; and one disillusion—mankind.” Warming to his theme, he parodied Lloyd George as “this goat-footed bard, this half-human visitor to our age from the hag-ridden magic and enchanted woods of Celtic antiquity.” Cooler heads eventually persuaded Keynes to withhold this last pen portrait from the published version of his book.

- Notwithstanding his newfound notoriety, Keynes—jobless after resigning from Treasury—desperately needed another source of income to sustain the rather lavish lifestyle to which he and the Bloomsbury circle had become accustomed. Putting his money where his mouth was, Keynes decided to back the pessimistic views expressed in Economic Consequences by speculating heavily on the foreign exchange market, taking short positions on key Continental currencies and long positions on the U.S. dollar. Keynes believed he was ideally equipped to play the speculation game—having lectured on the subject at Cambridge, he knew something of finance and exchanges; his stint at Treasury had provided an insight into global realpolitik and the interplay of capital flows; and he had ready access to a pool of investors willing to back his trading activities. Additionally, speculation offered the pleasing prospect of earning considerable amounts of money relatively painlessly. Like his contemporary Winston Churchill, much of Keynes’ business was transacted ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=389))

- while lounging in his bed. As one of his biographers noted:   Some of this financial decision-making was carried out while he was still in bed in the morning; reports would come to him by phone from his brokers, and he would read the newspapers and make his decisions.   It is to this incarnation of Keynes—the aesthete, the outsider, the languid speculator—that we now turn.

- The love of money as a possession . . . will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.   The more pragmatic side of Keynes accepted, however, the incontrovertible fact that money was, to use Dostoyevsky’s phrase, “coined liberty” and that “the enjoyments and realities of life” were withheld from those of little means. From these two competing insights arose a typically Keynesian compromise: Keynes would leap headlong into the world of finance, but the task of moneymaking would not consume him. It would remain an amusement, a means to an end, a way of supporting his more worthy ventures. And if he could win at the expense of those who professed an overweening love of money, then so much the better.

- Keynes’ drift from currency speculation was largely prompted by the decision of Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to restore sterling to the gold standard in 1925. Tethering the pound to a fixed benchmark radically reduced relative price movements—and hence a speculator’s opportunity for profit—in the currency market. Keynes strenuously opposed this move, but not just because it robbed him of a livelihood. He asserted in The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill—published in August 1925, the same month as his marriage to Lydia—that the Chancellor had been “deafened by the clamorous voices of conventional finance . . . and . . . gravely misled by his experts” who recommended that sterling be restored to its prewar exchange rate against the U.S. dollar.These “experts,” Keynes thought, were unwilling to countenance the possibility that the pound had effectively weakened in the decade or so since the start of the Great War. He argued that their insistence on maintaining a strong currency—partly motivated, one suspects, by a vague and misplaced sense of national pride—would price many British exports out of the market, leading to unemployment and a further weakening of an already fragile economy. Despite the vigor of his protests, Keynes’ jeremiad passed largely unheeded. As he remarked forlornly in a letter to The Times, “To debate monetary reform with a City editor . . . is like debating Darwinism with a bishop sixty years ago.” ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=501))

- Rather serendipitously, at around the same time Britain was cajoled back on to the gold standard—and, in consequence, currency trading opportunities dwindled—Keynes came across an “interesting little book” on equities. Edgar Lawrence Smith’s Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments analyzed the relative performance of American common stocks and bonds from 1866 to 1922. Smith’s original hypothesis was that an investment in common stocks would outperform an investment in bonds in a period of inflation, but the converse would be true in times of falling prices. This was an eminently reasonable assumption: businesses can generally hedge against inflation by increasing their prices to offset costs, but bond coupons remain fixed even in an environment of consistently rising prices. By the early 1920s, the role of stocks as an “inflationary shield” was more than a mere academic footnote. Many Continental European nations, destabilized by the ravages of the Great War and struggling to service reparations obligations, suffered mind-boggling inflation. The German government, to cite the most extreme example, printed money at such a rate that hyperinflation seized the country—a loaf of bread costing less than 200 marks in 1922 escalated to 200 billion marks by November 1923. In an inversion of the conventional consumer experience, shoppers entered a store with a trolley-full of cash and left with only a handful of items. In this environment, the value of bonds and bank deposits, which pay a fixed money amount regardless of any erosion in purchasing power, was destroyed. Although the value of stocks as a hedge against inflation was readily understood by the mid-1920s, accepted wisdom also held tenaciously to the assumed flip side of this finding—that in deflationary periods, bonds should outperform stocks. The results of Smith’s study on the relative merits of stocks and bonds were, however, quite unexpected. Smith found that, overwhelmingly, ordinary shares outperformed bonds not only in inflationary periods but also in times of falling prices. Smith attributed this result to a number of factors, the most important of which was the “compound interest” effect inherent in ordinary shares. As Keynes summarized in a review of Smith’s book:   Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years… ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=516))

- In contrast to the situation in Britain, a “high tide of prosperity,” as Keynes termed it, washed the shores of the United States. An already faltering international gold standard had obliged the Federal Reserve to lower American interest rates, and—partly fuelled by this cheap money—the richest society ever known to the world had embarked on what F. Scott Fitzgerald later described as “the most expensive orgy in history.” Seemingly defying gravity and the tenets of common sense, the Dow Jones index—that seismograph of investor confidence—traced an almost vertical ascent in the last years of the 1920s.Wall Street climbed more in the eighteen months to September 1929 than it had in the previous five years combined, and market darlings such as the Radio Corporation of America doubled and then doubled again over this period. Although Keynes’ attitude to America was ambivalent—he once commented that “I always regard a visit [to the United States] as in the nature of a serious illness to be followed by a convalescence”—his enthusiasm for Wall Street was sincere. Like so many others in benighted Europe, Keynes looked longingly across the Atlantic to the bright lights and palpable energy of New York. The advent of wire services made offshore investment practicable and a buoyant Wall Street became the natural destination for European speculative capital. Although Keynes’ dollar exposure during the 1920s represented only a very small portion of his personal portfolio, some of his investment companies were heavily invested in American securities, and in consequence he became an avid observer of the New York exchange. And it was to be on the febrile and frenetic Wall Street of the late 1920s that Keynes would encounter the extremes of investor psychology and discern the true nature of the stock market.

- At the end of 1928, a certain smugness about the state of the American economy seemed justified. Uncle Sam had grown fat on the remains of a Europe still recovering, dazed and haltingly, from the Great War. America was the world’s undisputed economic superpower, but paradoxically it had turned inward, shaken by its brief, bloody excursion to the Old World. Exploiting its newfound wealth, the country instead sought consolation in a massive binge of retail therapy. The techniques of mass production, honed during the war, were now applied to the civilian sphere, and radios, automobiles, and myriad domestic appliances spilled off America’s assembly lines. A nation of consumers was created to absorb this productive capacity—advertising and easy credit persuaded Americans to abandon their puritan peccadillos and embrace materialism. The Jazz Age was born—that curious mix of moneymaking and frivolity, parties and Prohibition. It was as if the whole country was animated by the relentless tempo of the production line. In this feverish environment of getting and spending, the stock market became a national obsession. As one British visitor noted in 1929: You could talk about Prohibition, or Hemingway, or air conditioning, or music, or horses, but in the end you had to talk about the stock market, and that was when the conversation became serious.   Bellhops and shoe-shine boys dispensed stock tips, punters bought shares on margin, brokers opened offices on ocean liners so transatlantic passengers could imbibe the bounty of Wall Street. Borne aloft on updrafts of investor euphoria, the Dow Jones index doubled in only a couple of years. Some commentators—noting a global system unbalanced by wartime debts and a domestic economy giddy on easy money—shook their heads and predicted an almighty financial hangover to follow the riotous Roaring Twenties. These Cassandras were, however, largely ignored. Wall Street pundits cited the improving effects of Prohibition on workers’ productivity and the steadying influence of the Federal Reserve, among other factors, to support their contention that stock prices were fundamentally sound. Perhaps the most potent rejoinder to the doomsayers, however, was an explanation appealing to that most American of traits—faith in the democratic process. The argument was best summarized by Professor Joseph Stagg Lawrence of Princeton University who, late in the summer of 1929, posed the following rhetorical challenge: ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=597))

- Intelligent group behavior, however, only flourishes where there is independence and diversity of opinion. As James Surowiecki explains in The Wisdom of Crowds:   Independence is important to intelligent decision making for two reasons. First, it keeps the mistakes that people make from becoming correlated. Errors in individual judgment won’t wreck the group’s collective judgment as long as these errors aren’t systematically pointing in the same direction . . . Second, independent individuals are more likely to have new information rather than the same old data everyone is already familiar with.   Paradoxically, group intelligence will only manifest when participants act as if they are not part of a group. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=638))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The intelligent multitude thesis works best where the group draws on diverse knowledge sets, can make individual judgments independently, and has a mechanism for assimilating these judgments into a collective prediction or decision. The Internet—an agglomeration of informed, atomistic individuals largely unconstrained by real-world complications, and the closest thing we have to the classical economic ideal of a “perfect market”—perhaps best illustrates the power of group intelligence. Google, for example, harnesses the decisions of millions of Internet users to identify web pages most relevant to particular search criteria. Through the operation of abstruse algorithms, links from one web page to another are interpreted as a “vote” for that page, with these votes weighted so that the most visited pages are accorded greater influence than more obscure sites. Google—a meritocracy of millions of individuals’ choices—generates an uncannily effective search tool from the distilled wisdom of the crowd. In a similar manner, stock exchanges absorb the myriad views of thousands of individuals, all of whom may “vote” by electing to buy or sell their securities. In theory, the stock market should be a highly effective forum for the exercise of collective intelligence: it incorporates the decisions of many independent actors, each motivated by the opportunity of financial return, and aggregates these judgments rapidly and transparently. Stockholders “voting” on the price of a security will bring their diverse perspectives to the process—including alternative information sources, differing time horizons, and contrasting investment styles. Efficient markets proponents argue that this arena of robustly competing opinions produces stock prices that embody, and appropriately weight, all publicly known information about a particular stock.

- The efficient markets theory does not, therefore, demand that all market participants be the finely calibrated calculating machines of classical theory—merely that sufficient numbers of discerning investors exist so as to countervail the actions of the less sophisticated. In other words, there must be enough investors in any particular market who—disregarding the implications of the efficient markets theory—believe that there are in fact bargains to be had. It is these discriminating investors who ensure that markets remain efficient—they are the ever-vigilant pike, securing the overall health of the pond. The efficient markets theory, then, is like a perverse fairytale—one that comes true only if enough people do not believe in it.

- Unfortunately for efficient markets proponents, individuals often cast aside their independence and instead seek the comfort of the crowd. Man, after all, is a social animal and, where possible, will rely on cues from his fellow creatures. The tendency to accede to the crowd may well be hardwired: the caveman who, on seeing a torrent of people rushing past him, their faces contorted in a rictus of fear, declines to join the stampede is unlikely to have passed his genes on to posterity. Running with the mob is a primal response, particularly in times of panic or uncertainty, but even in more settled circumstances an individual will often seek the imprimatur of the majority. “Social proof”—the belief that if a large number of people behave in a particular manner there must be a good reason for doing so—is a well-established psychological phenomenon. In the Asch conformity experiments of the 1950s, for example, a group of students was asked to judge the relative lengths of several lines. The catch was that all but one of the students were “insiders” instructed to give answers that were clearly incorrect. Despite obvious discomfort with their responses, around a third of the test subjects conformed to the erroneous view—they believed that the majority could simply not be wrong. In circumstances such as these, the wisdom of the crowd degenerates into “groupthink”—a situation where each member of a group complies with the perceived consensus. Stock markets are particularly prone to this follow-the-crowd tendency. The bandwagon most conspicuously traverses the uncharted promised land of “new economy” industries—railways in the 1840s, radio in the 1920s, transistors in the 1960s—where a technology is commercially unproven or not readily understood by the bulk of the investing public, and investors take their prompts from those seemingly in the know.The twentieth century’s final speculative craze—the dot-com debacle of the 1990s—sported the holy trinity of bubble factors: an emerging technology, new commercial opportunities, and the means for groupthink to propagate itself in chat rooms where like-minded individuals could pontificate without fear of contradiction. Like some sinister self-replicating virus, fostering the conditions of its own flourishing, the Internet bubble fed off the Internet itself as day traders bid up “new economy” stock to unsustainable levels.

- With magnificent circularity, rising prices lead to rising prices.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Financial exchanges, then, are particularly predisposed to informational cascades—episodes where the polarity of the market changes, and speculators predominate over more reasoned elements. The market reaches a pivot point where the intelligent multitude mutates into the unreasoning rabble, or, to use Keynes’ metaphor, the schooling carp overwhelm the predatory pike. When the “smart money” is swamped by those scrambling aboard the bandwagon, the group is no longer intelligent and the market forfeits any claim to efficiency. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a speculator is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. The speculator’s concern is not to independently assess the value of a particular stock, but rather to divine the future movement of the market in an attempt to on-sell the stockholding at a profit. Keynes captured the mindset of the speculator perfectly:   . . . most of these persons are, in fact, largely concerned, not with making superior long-term forecasts of the probable yield of an investment over its whole life, but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public. They are concerned, not with what an investment is really worth to a man who buys it “for keeps,” but with what the market will value it at, under the influence of mass psychology, three months or a year hence.   It is the “greater fool” trading strategy—where, as Keynes noted, the speculators’ objective is “to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depreciating, half-crown to the other fellow.” ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=740))

- The key task for the speculator is, therefore, to correctly time the purchase and sale of securities. Based on this belief, Keynes, in the early part of his investment career, thought that success on the stock market required little more than anticipating the anticipations of others. The rationale behind this strategy was set out in A Treatise on Money, written in the late 1920s:   . . . it may often profit the wisest [stock market player] to anticipate mob psychology rather than the real trend of events, and to ape unreason proleptically [i.e. in anticipation] . . . Thus, so long as the crowd can be relied on to act in a certain way, even if it be misguided, it will be to the advantage of the better-informed professional to act in the same way—a short period ahead.   Keynes’ principal stock market trading strategy in the 1920s—which he christened “credit cycle investing”—faithfully reflected the market-timing approach of the typical speculator. Credit cycling was an application of the oldest stock market maxim in the book: buy low and sell high. As Keynes explained many years later, credit cycling in respect of common stocks “means in practice selling market leaders on a falling market and buying them on a rising one.” It was a “top-down” approach to stock market investment, involving “a general systematic movement out of and into ordinary shares as a whole at different phases of the trade cycle.” This approach—sometimes dignified with the slightly more scientific-sounding appellations of “momentum investing” or “anticipatory trading”—relies on the speculator’s ability to apprehend turns in the market and time trades accordingly. For the “credit cycler,” price momentum is the fundamental trading driver, rather than any assessment of the inherent value of a stock relative to its price. An investment approach requiring the individual to anticipate something as fluid and capricious as “mob psychology” is, as Keynes would later discover, no easy undertaking. He compared the task to:   . . . those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.   Momentum investors operate in an Alice in Wonderland world of second-guesses—a crazy,… ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=763))

- In contrast to his American confrere, Keynes had substantially reduced his exposure to the stock market prior to the Great Crash of 1929. This move was not, however, attributable to any superior foresight on Keynes’ account. Rather, his “terrifying adventures” on the speculative markets—this time, the commodities market—had once again brought him undone. In 1928, after several years of profitable trading, Keynes’ positions in the rubber, corn, cotton, and tin markets turned against him, and he was obliged to liquidate the bulk of his equities to cover these losses. The stock exchange upheavals of late 1929 then exacted a heavy toll on what little remained of Keynes’ stock portfolio: his main holding—the Austin Motor Car Company—lost over three-quarters of its value in the final two years of the 1920s. In aggregate, Keynes’ net worth declined by more than 80 percent over this period—from £44,000 at the start of 1928 to less than £8,000 two years later—and, for the second time in his life, he found himself poised on the precipice of financial ruin.

- Implicit in the idea of business cycles, however, is the notion that—as surely as spring follows winter—the economy will at some stage revert to its previous prosperity.

- The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in February 1936, disputed the orthodox doctrine that free markets always produce optimal results. Like its namesake, Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, Keynes’ magnum opus overthrew the accepted theoretical structure, showing that markets were not necessarily analogous to the clockwork precision of Newtonian physics. Keynes likened classical economists to “Euclidean geometers in a non-Euclidean world who, discovering that in experience straight lines apparently parallel often meet, rebuke the lines for not keeping straight.” In his opinion, parts of the classical doctrine, although theoretically elegant, were based on flawed assumptions and deduced outcomes clearly diverging from those in the real world. Keynes set himself the task of overturning the redundant truths of his predecessors. As he prophesied to his friend George Bernard Shaw in 1935, The General Theory would “largely revolutionize . . . the way the world thinks about economic problems.” The General Theory was written at a time when most of the developed world had already endured years of chronic unemployment and stagnation—a situation that orthodox economic doctrine deigned impossible, as theory dictated that markets were self-correcting and naturally worked toward full employment. Classical economists argued that the economy was languishing partly because workers were not sufficiently flexible—if only they would behave more like the rational automatons of classical economic theory, willing to take a cut in wages sufficient to justify their employment, then the labor market would self-correct and full employment return. Keynes believed the orthodox theory—which essentially blamed the unemployed for their plight—to be “wicked” and, moreover, wrong-headed. A central conclusion in The General Theory—informed by Keynes’ own experience as a speculator—was that the psychology of uncertainty impaired the efficient operation of the market. The existence of uncertainty would periodically result in bouts of underinvestment and oversaving, leading in turn to underutilization of an economy’s resources. The Keynesian solution to this state of affairs was, in essence, to boost an economy’s aggregate expenditure by increasing government spending to offset lower business and consumer activity.

- In the same way that Adam Smith thought that the “vain and insatiable desires” of consumers led by the operation of an invisible hand to the advancement of society as a whole, so, too, did Keynes propose a type of hidden hand which transformed the perceived vices of deficit financing into the virtues of full employment and economic stability. In challenging the paradoxical doctrine of the invisible hand, Keynes, the great perverter, proposed an equally counterintuitive proposal—that at certain times, state profligacy could be the most responsible policy.

- Keynes thought his “monetary theory of production” to be “moderately conservative in its implications.” The Keynesian blue-print merely advocated an external stimulus—“an impulse, a jolt, an acceleration,” as Keynes put it—when Adam Smith’s invisible hand becomes atrophied through inaction. Once the economic engine had been reignited and “our central controls succeed in establishing an aggregate volume of output corresponding to full employment as nearly as is practicable,” then, he commented, “the classical theory comes into its own again from this point onwards.” In the previous century Lord Salisbury had stated that British foreign policy was “to float lazily downstream, occasionally putting out a diplomatic boathook to avoid collisions.” Keynes’s proposed economic policy was similar in conception but somewhat more vigorous in execution—the government would act as a rudder on the ship of state, guiding the economy out of danger when unemployment and stagnation loomed.

- Considering that Keynes’ theory told many politicians exactly what they wanted to hear—that the path to recovery lay not in austerity but in higher spending and lower taxes—it is somewhat surprising that his ideas took so long to be accepted by policymakers. It would not be until that period of sustained global public expenditure otherwise known as the Second World War that “Keynesianism” became the dominant creed of Western nations. Keynes had written in The General Theory that:   Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.   Keynes’ academic scribblings—the belief that fiscal policy should be used to fine-tune an economy’s “aggregate demand”—usurped the laissez-faire theories of the classical school almost as comprehensively as Darwin’s narrative had displaced that of Genesis. For three decades after the war, as the Western world luxuriated in conditions of “permanent boom,” even Keynes’ most vehement ideological adversaries reluctantly conceded that “we are all Keynesians now.” Keynes had dragged economics, kicking and screaming, into the twentieth century—from a study of choice under conditions of scarcity to a study of choice under conditions of uncertainty, and from an emphasis on microeconomic factors to an emphasis on aggregates. In his own way, he contributed to the Bloomsbury mission to introduce modernism into Western society, for his economics owed perhaps more to Sigmund Freud’s conception of the primal mind than to earlier notions of economic rationality and mechanistic order. The Keynesian hegemony would finally yield to a counterrevolution of sorts in the 1970s, when conditions of “stagflation”—consistently rising prices in an environment of high unemployment—fostered the revival of neoclassical economics in general, and monetarism in particular. But just as the embers of the first Keynesian… ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1158))

- Newton was also an ardent pursuer of material wealth. Unsuccessful in his alchemical effort to transmute base metals into gold, he eventually found his own Philosopher’s Stone as Master of the Royal Mint. In this capacity, Newton oversaw the recoinage of England’s currency, receiving a commission on all coins struck under his supervision and becoming extraordinarily rich in the process. In 1720, toward the end of his long life, Newton ventured some of his fortune in stock of the South Sea Company. After selling his initial holding for a considerable profit, Newton was induced by rising stock prices to re-enter the market. The second time around he was not so lucky. The South Sea Bubble burst and Newton lost around £20,000—more than $6 million in today’s money. Chastened by this demonstration of gravity in the world of finance, he remarked ruefully, “I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.” Like his hero Newton, Maynard Keynes also learned the hard way that—largely due to the unavoidable fact of uncertainty—financial markets were sometimes buffeted by unpredictable squalls of “whim or sentiment or chance” and prey to “purely irrational waves of optimism or depression.” Having spent a decade trying to anticipate the quicksilver tacks of the market—and having been wrong-footed on more than one occasion—Keynes finally concluded that those who run with the crowd are apt to be trampled. Better to stand back from the thundering herd, he decided, than be torn asunder in the running of the bulls or the flight from the bears.

- Among his other accomplishments, Keynes was also a leading authority on Newton, a position enhanced by his acquisition of the scientist’s papers. Keynes brought to the world’s attention the occult-obsessed, metaphysical side of Newton—portraying him as a man with “one foot in the Middle Ages, and one foot treading a path for modern science.” He also appropriated Newton’s idea of “animal spirits”—arguing that in the supposedly mechanistic world of financial markets, investors were often propelled by something other than a clinical analysis of expected outcomes. Keynes’ General Theory explained that financial markets are not only prone to periodic informational cascades that compromise efficiency, but also that investors cannot be the rational actors of classical theory because a cold calculation of expected outcomes is simply not possible. With incontrovertible common sense, Keynes observed that there are some events for which “there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever”:   The outstanding fact is the extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made. Our knowledge of the factors which will govern the yield of an investment some years hence is usually very slight and often negligible. If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing . . .   “Wishes are fathers to thoughts,” Keynes once observed. Remarkably, it seemed that in championing the case for efficient markets, orthodox theory had glossed over the fact that “core risk”—uncertainty that cannot be assigned a probability—precludes a precise calculation of a stock’s expected yield. Keynes therefore rejected orthodox theory’s blithe assumption that, in valuing a security, financial market participants could perform “a good Benthamite calculation of a series of prospective advantages and disadvantages, each multiplied by its appropriate probability, waiting to be summed.” Despite the assumptions of classical theory, there are, as Keynes pointed out, many factors about which “we simply do not know.” ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1214))

- Keynes invoked a paradox beloved of philosophers—that of “Buridan’s ass”—to illustrate why “the necessity for action and for decision compels us as practical men” to overlook the “awkward fact” that a uniquely correct valuation of a stock is impossible. Buridan’s ass is an apocryphal beast that, faced with two equally attractive and accessible bales of hay, starved while deliberating which one was preferable. Like the donkey of the parable, stock market participants—if they were to attempt to apply a purely rational approach to their investment decisions—would also be rendered immobile by the daunting “what ifs” of an unknowable future. Instead, they resort to less analytical factors when assessing stock market opportunities:   To avoid being in the position of Buridan’s ass, we fall back . . . on motives . . . which are not “rational” in the sense of being concerned with the evaluation of consequences, but are decided by habit, instinct, preference, desire, will etc.   The stock market player is impelled—in part at least—by factors that, although not rational, are nevertheless legitimate in some sense. Unlike the situation with, say, government bonds—which pay a fixed coupon, and whose present investment value can be determined with reasonable precision—stocks exist in a twilight zone of ambiguity.This uncertainty gap is a blank canvas on which the investor projects his or her most fervent hopes or darkest fears. “Animal spirits”—the “spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction,” as Keynes defined them—embolden individuals and allow them to bridge the uncertainty gap inherent in any investment decision. The investor, Keynes concluded, is not the perfectly knowledgeable calculating machine of orthodox theory. Despite the assertions of efficient markets proponents, stock market behavior is not—cannot be—governed by purely rational factors.

- Not only does the presence of uncertainty mean that investors fall back on their “state of confidence” or “animal spirits” when making investment decisions, but it also exaggerates the impact of near-term factors on a stock’s performance. In his A Treatise on Money, published in 1930, Keynes noted:   . . . how sensitive—over-sensitive if you like—to the near future, about which we may think we know a little, even the best-informed must be, because, in truth, we know almost nothing about the more remote future.   Not unreasonably, Keynes conceded, investors attach greater weight to matters about which they are relatively more confident, “even though they may be less decisively relevant to the issue than other facts about which our knowledge is vague and scanty.” In consequence:   . . . the facts of the existing situation enter, in a sense disproportionately, into the formation of our long-term expectations; our usual practice being to take the existing situation and to project it into the future, modified only to the extent that we have more or less definite reasons for expecting a change.   The broad assumption that “… ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1261))

- As an example of this tendency, Keynes claimed—not without a touch of hyperbole—that “the shares of American companies which manufacture ice tend to sell at a higher price in summer when their profits are seasonally high than in winter when no one wants ice” and that the “recurrence of a bank-holiday may raise the market valuation of the British railway system by several million pounds.” The focus on the shorter term means that investor expectations—and therefore stock prices—are extremely sensitive to new information, and that:   Faced with the perplexities and uncertainties of the modern world, market values will fluctuate much more widely than will seem reasonable in the light of after-events ...   In simple terms, the unavoidable fact of uncertainty prompts stock market players to latch on to new information, causing stock prices to overshoot. Empirical evidence supports Keynes’ thesis—studies show that stock prices display far greater volatility than would be expected relative to changes in underlying earnings and dividends. Exacerbating this tendency to overweight new information is the “risk… ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1277))

- The stock market, Keynes demonstrated, was not always the unassailable paragon of efficiency that orthodox financial theorists claimed it to be. It was prone to informational cascades—episodes where prices would snowball in one direction or the other merely because momentum had seized the market—and, more fundamentally, investment decisions were impelled to some extent by necessarily nonrational factors. As Keynes pointed out, due to the inescapable fact of uncertainty, “all sorts of considerations enter into the market valuation which are in no way relevant to the prospective yield.” ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1298))

- The economy, as Keynes noted, exhibits what have come to be called “emergent properties”: complex, sometimes unpredictable, collective behavior in a system, arising out of the multiplicity of interactions between its individual constituents. Behavior in the atomistic world of microeconomics cannot always be extrapolated to the sphere of macroeconomics, the study of aggregates. Keynes’ most famous example of the “fallacy of composition” was the so-called Paradox of Thrift—which notes that saving is good for the individual, but if all individuals increase their savings then aggregate demand will fall, eventually leading to lower savings for the population as a whole. Similarly, the stock market—one of the purest expressions of the free market system—can, on occasions, display emergent properties, where individual behavior mutates into mob irrationality. Even for someone of Keynes’ protean interests and abilities, the stock market was simply too vast and too complex a mechanism to second-guess.

- Keynes eventually concluded that because of the utter capriciousness and complexity of the stock market, a short-term “momentum investing” approach rarely rewarded its followers with financial success. As he conceded to a colleague in May 1938:   I can only say that I was the principal inventor of credit cycle investment and have seen it tried by five different parties acting in detail on distinctly different lines over a period of nearly twenty years, which has been full of ups and downs; and I have not seen a single case of a success having been made of it.   Keynes thought that credit cycling not only demanded “abnormal foresight” and required “phenomenal skill to make much out of it,” but that transaction expenses from such a necessarily active investment policy tended to erode trading profits. He expanded on this theme in a memorandum to the King’s College Estates Committee:   . . . I am clear that the idea of wholesale shifts [out of and into stocks at different stages of the business cycle] is for various reasons impracticable and indeed undesirable. Most of those who attempt it sell too late and buy too late, and do both too often, incurring heavy expenses and developing too unsettled and speculative a state of mind . . .   Keynes’ realization that there was no method to the market’s madness prompted a radical change in his investment approach. Following the Great Crash, he completely inverted his investment principles, becoming an investor rather than a speculator—one who focuses on likely future performance rather than past trends, expected yield rather than disposal price, particular stocks rather than the broader index, and relying on his own judgment rather than that of the market. Simply stated, Keynes switched from market timer to value investor, seeking to profit from swings in the market rather than participating in them.

- “Tulipomania” saw the pathogen of animal spirits visit that most stolid of people, the Dutch burghers of the seventeenth century. As Charles Mackay recalls in his catalog of human folly, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, the “rage to possess” tulips was so powerful that:   Speculative fervor for the exotic plants was such that traders, in an early version of a futures contract, started to sell the rights to bulbs they had not yet even planted. This innovation—dismissively labeled windhandel, or… ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1365))

- Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen, footmen, maidservants, even chimney-sweeps and old clotheswomen, dabbled in tulips. People of all grades converted their property in cash, and invested it in flowers. “Broken” flowers—cultivars with flares of blazing color—were the most highly valued. By early 1637, one bulb of the Semper Augustus strain—its blood-red flames vivid against a pure white—commanded the same price as a large canal-side house in Amsterdam. The variegated hues of these prized flowers were caused by a virus, and, as was later discovered, it was the virus that both increased the attractiveness of the flowers and also contributed to their frailty. As Mackay explained:   When it has been weakened by cultivation, [the tulip] becomes more agreeable in the eyes of the florist . . .Thus this masterpiece of culture, the more beautiful it turns, grows so much the weaker, so that, with the greatest skill and most careful attention, it can scarcely be transplanted, or even kept alive.   The Dutch tulipomania eventually, and inevitably, unwound in a most spectacular manner. Bulbs that had sold for 5,000 guilders in January 1637 fetched only 50 guilders a month later. The Dutch courts correctly diagnosed the malady that had temporarily seized the population—characterizing the transactions as nothing more than gambling operations, they declined to enforce outstanding contracts of sale. The tulipomania—in addition to providing another illustration of the periodic irrationality that ensnares markets—also affords a metaphor for financial exchanges generally. Like the tulip, whose refinement and frailty move in tandem, the more highly evolved a stock market, the greater the risk that it will be susceptible to the contagion of animal spirits. As Keynes noted in The General Theory, when “the organization of investment markets improves, the risk of the predominance of speculation does, however, increase.” Having disposed of the fiction of investors as rational calculating machines summing… ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1370))

- Keynes also lamented that the financial exchanges—with their constant price quotations and potential to readily monetize investments—gave:   . . . a frequent opportunity to the individual . . . to revise his commitments. It is as though a farmer, having tapped his barometer after breakfast, could decide to remove his capital from the farming business between 10 and 11 in the morning and reconsider whether he should return to it later in the week. Greater liquidity, lower transaction costs, and the advent of the Internet combine to make shares even easier to trade today, and in consequence have further exacerbated the flightiness of capital. These factors also make stocks increasingly abstract concepts, disembodied from the businesses they represent—“an abstraction, a name, a symbol interchangeable with a certain amount of money,” as one commentator described the transformation of the humble tulip during the Dutch derangement of the seventeenth century. The perception by many market participants that stocks are little more than a number in a newspaper column or on a computer screen—a mere trading chip divorced from the underlying business, rather than a part-interest in the business itself—further inflames the speculative mindset.

- The efficient markets hypothesis states that although some stock market participants may not boast Spock-like levels of rationality and cool-headedness, the smart money will nevertheless act to rein in any pricing anomalies produced. Keynes dismissed this belief as little more than a convenient fiction: It might have been supposed that competition between expert professionals, possessing judgment and knowledge beyond that of the average private investor, would correct the vagaries of the ignorant individual left to himself. It happens, however, that the energies and skill of the professional investor and speculator are mainly occupied otherwise. For most of these persons are, in fact, largely concerned, not with making superior long-term forecasts of the probable yield of an investment over its whole life, but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public.   Professional investors, in practice, rarely accept the role of market monitor assigned to them by orthodox theory. As Keynes noted, there is overwhelming institutional pressure to conform, even among allegedly sophisticated investors: ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1426))

- it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is in the essence of his behavior that he should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy.   Like the mass of investors, fund managers are more often concerned with not underperforming than trying to outperform. In practice, they do not provide a countervailing force against the more flighty investors—indeed, on many occasions they actually amplify the swings of investor irrationality. Intensifying the short-term focus of many institutional investment managers are two additional factors—an emphasis on “total returns” as a performance guide, and the presence of “index-tracking funds.” Total returns measures—comprising dividend payments and any increase or decrease in the price of a given stock—are usually dominated by unrealized capital gains or losses, which once again focuses attention on short-term stock price fluctuations. Index-tracking funds—investment vehicles that seek to replicate market performance by holding a representative portfolio of stocks—aggravate the market’s tendency to overshoot by reinforcing trends in the market. Index funds are momentum investors in excelsis—they automatically buy more of a stock as its price, and therefore its value relative to the broader market, increases, and sell as its price decreases—thus adding to overshoots and further eroding the purported efficiency of financial exchanges.

- Just as impressive as his financial recovery was his return to the Establishment fold. The man who had likened himself to Cassandra of Greek mythology—gifted with the powers of prophecy, but fated never to be believed—found himself embraced once again by the ruling elite. Like Churchill, Keynes was drafted into deal with a situation he had long presaged, when in 1940 he became an unpaid adviser to the Chancellor—in his words, a “demi-semi-official” with a wide-ranging brief to formulate economic policy for war-pressed Britain. The following year he was installed as a director of the Bank of England—on his appointment he quipped to his mother that it could only be a matter of time before he became a bishop—and in 1942 elevated to a peerage, becoming Lord Keynes, Baron of Tilton. In the closing stages of the war he continued to straddle the worlds of Mammon and of Art—acting as Britain’s chief representative at both the international monetary conference at Bretton Woods and in loan negotiations with the United States, and becoming the United Kingdom’s first arts tsar as inaugural chairman of what would evolve into the British Arts Council. Remarkably, these various offices were carried out while Keynes was in extremely frail health. In mid-1937, just before his fifty-fourth birthday, he suffered his first heart attack, and was confined to a sanatorium and later his country house in Sussex for much of his convalescence. Paralleling Keynes’ physical breakdown was a short, sharp economic recession in late 1937 and 1938, accompanied by another severe “sinking spell” on major stock markets. Unable to attend many board and investment committee meetings due to his enforced confinement, and obliged to defend his stock market techniques amid yet another bout of pervasive pessimism, Keynes explained his investment philosophy in a series of letters and memoranda to his colleagues. It is from this rich documentary legacy that we distill Keynes’ six key investment principles, representing a straightforward and time-tested system for exploiting the periodic irrationality of stock markets.

- Despite their skepticism about the effectiveness of the stock market in the short run, value investors generally accept that over the longer term stock markets price securities efficiently. As Keynes commented in a letter to a colleague, “when the safety, excellence, and cheapness of a share is generally realized, its price is bound to go up.” Ben Graham offers another arresting analogy to illustrate this tendency:   . . . the market is not a weighing machine, on which the value of each issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities. Rather should we say that the market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals register choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.

- In the near term, stock prices oscillate around true worth, and at times the amplitude of divergence can be significant. In the longer term, however, the truth will out. As Buffett comments, “The market may ignore business success for a while, but eventually will confirm it.” Market efficiency, for value investors, is therefore a question of timing—although not agreeing that financial exchanges are invariably efficient in the short run, they generally accept that in the long run stock markets are indeed very effective “weighing machines.” As pioneering fund manager John Bogle observes, “The fact is that when the perception—interim stock prices—vastly departs from the reality—intrinsic corporate values—the gap can only be reconciled in favor of reality.” This is due to a simple and indisputable mathematical identity— ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1674))

Animal spirits lack endurance—they may deflect prices from underlying value for a period of time, but ultimately the hard realities of earnings and dividends will determine the value of a business to its owners. Empirical evidence confirms the effectiveness of stock markets as a weighing machine over the longer term. As one report concludes, although year-to-year stock performance is heavily influenced by price movements:   For the seriously long-term investor, the value of a portfolio corresponds closely to the present value of dividends.The present value of the (eventual) capital appreciation dwindles greatly into insignificance.

- It is on expected earnings and dividends, therefore, that the value investor concentrates, rather than short-term price fluctuations. The quoted price of a stock is useful only as a point of reference, in determining whether the market is offering substantially more or less than the estimated underlying value of the security. In explaining his investment philosophy to a colleague, Keynes remarked that:   My purpose is to buy securities where I am satisfied as to assets and ultimate earning power and where the market price seems cheap in relation to these. As Keynes emphasized, when ascertaining the underlying value of a stock, it is the company’s net assets or, more often, its “ultimate earning power” that is relevant.

Ultimately, however, it is the expected earning power of a stock that counts. ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1705))

- Origins of the Specious There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics. —MARK TWAIN, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARK TWAIN   Despite the fact that the only certainty about future returns from a security is their very uncertainty, a similar defect afflicts the stock market—analysts solemnly apply rigorous quantitative techniques to derive a valuation, down to the last cent, for a particular stock. Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger has labeled this bias toward quantification, at the expense of qualitative factors, as the “man with a hammer” syndrome—“To the man with only a hammer,” he observes, “every problem looks like a nail.” Echoing Hayek’s criticisms, Munger notes that:   ... practically everybody (1) overweighs the stuff that can be numbered, because it yields to the statistical techniques they’re taught in academia, and (2) doesn’t mix in the hard-to-measure stuff that may be more important.   It appears that human psychology demands this spurious precision in an effort to mask the uncertainty inherent in any investment decision.

- Keynes, like Warren Buffett after him, practiced a more dynamic valuation methodology—one focused on projected earnings accruing to a particular firm.The notional tool used in this type of analysis is the “dividend discount model.” This model states that the intrinsic value of a given security is determined by the stream of its prospective dividend payments over time, discounted back to a present value. Warren Buffett highlighted the tasks required of an investor using this technique:   If you buy a bond, you know exactly what’s going to happen, assuming it’s a good bond . . . If it says 9 percent, you know what the coupons are going to be for maybe thirty years . . . Now, when you buy a business, you’re buying something with coupons on it, too, except, the only problem is, they don’t print the amount. And it’s my job to print in the amount on the coupon. Unlike government or corporate bonds—which carry a known coupon and a predetermined maturity date—the expected income flow from a security cannot be determined with any degree of precision. Instead, the investor must refer to qualitative factors when determining the value of a stock.Warren Buffett provides an everyday analogy to describe the derivation of intrinsic value:   It’s exactly what I would do if I were going to buy a Ford dealership in Omaha—only with a few more zeros. If I were going to try and buy that business—let’s say I weren’t going to manage it—I’d try to figure out what sort of economics are attached to it:What’s the competition like? What can the return on equity likely be over time? Is this the guy to run it? Is he going to be straight with me? It’s the same thing with a public company.The only difference is that the numbers are bigger and you buy them in little pieces.   Ascertaining the intrinsic value of a stock is a necessarily inexact art—as Buffett observes, the underlying or fundamental value of a stock is “a number that is impossible to pinpoint but essential to estimate.” ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=1862))

- future.Warren Buffett—a famous no-show at the Internet bender of the late 1990s—explained his preference, as an investor, for those stocks sometimes dismissively labeled as “boring”:   With Coke I can come up with a very rational figure for the cash it will generate in the future. But with the top 10 Internet companies, how much cash will they produce over the next 25 years? If you say you don’t know, then you don’t know what it is worth and you are speculating, not investing. All I know is that I don’t know, and if I don’t know, I don’t invest. In an undergraduate essay on the British philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke, Keynes noted in passing that:   Our power of prediction is so slight, our knowledge of remote consequences so uncertain, that it is seldom wise to sacrifice a present benefit for a doubtful advantage in the future.   Keynes’ observation was a rather baroque restatement of the proverb “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” In the stock market arena, too, Keynes eventually adhered to this principle—“ultimate earning power,” not the vague promise of riches in some undefined future period, was fundamental in determining the worth of a stock. Warren Buffett similarly insists on “demonstrated consistent earning power” before he commits capital to a particular security. He notes that:   The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.

- It would take more than a decade before Keynes applied the lessons learned in the Paris showroom to the domain of stock market investing. Abandoning the bandwagon-jumping approach of “credit cycling” during the turmoil of the late 1920s and early 1930s, he turned instead to a diametrically opposed investment style—one that focused on acquiring a handful of stocks at prices offering a substantial discount to expected future earnings potential, regardless of the whims and fashions of the market. After many successes and reversals, Keynes had eventually discerned that the stock market could, on occasion, be myopic, excessively optimistic or pessimistic, flighty, or propelled by informational cascades. It was at these times that the value investor’s contrarian mantra that “one should be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy” came into its own.

- Keynes rejected the more strident claims of efficient markets proponents, believing instead that, on occasions, a preponderance of “game players” over “serious-minded individuals” could produce a sustained divergence between quoted prices and underlying stock value. Like many other spheres of activity, stocks could be subject to the whims of fashion, caught up in the roiling currents of informational cascades where rising prices produce rising prices or falling prices engender further declines. Fred Schwed applied a characteristically cynical interpretation to this phenomenon:   Those classes of investments considered “best” change from period to period.The pathetic fallacy is that what are thought to be the best are in truth only the most popular—the most active, the most talked of, the most boosted, and consequently, the highest in price at that time. It is very much a matter of fashion, like Eugenie hats or waxed mustaches.   The stock exchange is, at times, patently not the exemplar of efficiency that orthodox theorists claim it to be. Notwithstanding its proclaimed role as a machine to crystallize expected future cash flows, the market on occasions succumbs to the fundamental fundamental—in an exuberant bull market, more willing buyers than sellers; in a despondent bear market, more willing sellers than buyers. The ripples from these waves of optimism or pessimism affect even those stocks initially untouched by investor irrationality, as capital is channeled into “hot” stocks and away from others. As Ben Graham commented in The Intelligent Investor: The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordinary vicissitudes into major setbacks. Even a mere lack of interest or enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.   This displacement effect was particularly evident, for example, in the dying days of the 1990s, when the rush to “new economy” shares created a two-speed market—on many exchanges the “TMT” trinity of telecommunications, media, and technology stocks broadly doubled in only a couple of years, while the derisively labeled “old economy” stocks languished out of the limelight.

- In an interview with Outstanding Investor Digest, Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger expanded on this point:   Everybody goes [to the racetrack] and bets and the odds change based on what’s bet. That’s what happens in the stock market. Any damn fool can see that a horse carrying a light weight with a wonderful win rate and a good post position . . . is way more likely to win than a horse with a terrible record and extra weight and so on . . . But if you look at the odds, the bad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the good horse pays 3 to 2. Then it’s not clear which is statistically the best bet . . . The prices have changed in such a way that it’s very hard to beat the system.   In a broadly efficient stock market—as with a correctly priced horse race—it is indeed extremely difficult to beat the system. The key to success in both these arenas, therefore, is to identify the radically mispriced bet—the horse or stock that offers good odds and has a strong chance of performing.

- Keynes realized that radically mispriced stock market bets are most abundant when there exists great uncertainty and, in consequence, widely divergent opinions about the value of a stock. As he explained to a colleague, “The art of investing, if there is such an art, is that of taking advantage of the consequences of a mistaken opinion which is widespread.” In making this observation, Keynes echoed an insight of Frank Knight, a University of Chicago academic. Knight noted that there were two types of uncertainty—measurable probability, which he labeled “risk,” and unquantifiable ambiguity, which was true uncertainty. “Risk” can be assigned a probability value—such as the 50 percent chance of throwing heads in a coin toss or the one-in-six prospect of rolling a particular number on a die—whereas “uncertainty” is utterly unmeasurable. In the free enterprise system, Knight asserted, only true uncertainty—“ignorance of the future,” as he described it—can consistently create potentially profitable situations, as quantifiable risk should, in theory, already be factored into the pricing of an asset. Those investors wishing to profit from the stock market, therefore, are those who embrace uncertainty.

- The early misadventures of Berkshire Hathaway illustrate a broader lesson learned by both Keynes and Buffett—the importance of acquiring interests in businesses possessing a sustainable competitive advantage, or commercial “moats” as Buffett describes them. Berkshire Hathaway’s original business, textile manufacturing, was a commodity-type industry requiring high capital expenditure and delivering generally poor returns. Better long-term business investment prospects, Buffett discovered, lay in those companies possessing sturdy barriers to competition, such as unique franchises, settled oligopolies, or well-known brand names. Buffett emphasizes “the importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds”—the ultimate investment opportunity presents itself, he advises, “when a great company gets into temporary trouble.” In this respect, Buffett departs from the practice of his mentor, Ben Graham. Graham believed in buying average businesses at cheap prices—he would build a widely diversified portfolio of those stocks meeting his simple but rigorous quantitative measures, in the expectation that a sufficient number of these businesses would surmount their vicissitudes and eventually increase in price. Buffett’s investment criteria, in contrast, focuses more on qualitative factors—he looks for “great companies with dominant positions, whose franchise is hard to duplicate and has tremendous staying power or some permanence to it.” In this emphasis on quality—buying companies with defensible moats at fair prices—Buffett reflects the approach of Keynes. In an early magazine article, Keynes endorsed the virtues of “blue chips”:   It is generally a good rule for an investor, having settled on the class of security he prefers—. . . bank shares or oil shares, or investment trusts, or industrials, or debentures, preferred or ordinary, whatever it may be—to buy only the best within that category.

- One of Keynes’ colleagues at the Provincial Insurance Company recalled an occasion when a member of the Investment Committee suggested buying Indian government bonds. “By all means,” Keynes responded, “but timing is important.Wait ’til a Viceroy has been assassinated!” Maynard Keynes realized that it was periods of uncertainty that produced the conditions necessary for “stunners” to emerge. A rather extreme example of this tendency—and one that gives credence to the charge of economics as the dismal science—was the experience of Keynes’ protégé, the Italian economist Piero Sraffa. According to one story circulating within Cambridge, Sraffa—who was in possession of a substantial family inheritance—waited patiently for “the one perfect investment.” Shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the Allies, he invested heavily in Japanese government bonds—and subsequently reaped a fortune in Japan’s postwar “miracle years.” Keynes himself exploited the tremendous uncertainty and fear created during the Great Depression to effect his greatest contrarian triumph. In late 1933, when shell-shocked American investors flinched at FDR’s robust anticorporate rhetoric, Keynes started buying preferred shares of utility companies, reasoning that they were “now hopelessly out of fashion with American investors and heavily depressed below their real value.” Despite fears that Roosevelt would nationalize electricity utilities, Keynes acquired significant shareholdings in the belief that:   . . . some of the American preferred stocks offer today one of those outstanding opportunities which occasionally occur of buying cheap into what is for the time being an irrationally unfashionable market.   In the following year alone, Keynes’ net worth would almost triple, largely on the back of his plunge on Wall Street.

- Keynes was a defiant individualist and very diffident team player. He once joked that his chief hobby was “fluttering dovecotes, particularly in the City,”and the man sometimes seemed constitutionally incapable of finding accord with the majority. In the closing stages of World War II, during loan negotiations with the United States, Keynes’ frustration with consensus-building excited some of his finest invective. He called Leo Crowley, the American administrator of the Lend-Lease scheme, a “Tammany Polonius” whose “ear [was] so near the ground that he was out of range of persons speaking from an erect position,” and observed for good measure that the unfortunately florid Crowley had a face like “the buttocks of a baboon.” Of Marriner Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve and a key member of the American negotiating team, he commented: “No wonder that man is a Mormon. No single woman could stand him.” James Meade, later a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, unsurprisingly described the fiercely independent Keynes as “a menace in international negotiations.” Similarly, Keynes—the instinctive contrarian—was uncomfortable with an investment-by-committee approach. In a contrite letter to a fellow member on the Eton finances committee, he explained:   My central principle of investment is to go contrary to general opinion, on the ground that, if everyone agreed about its merits, the investment is inevitably too dear and therefore unattractive. Now obviously I can’t have it both ways—the whole point of the investment is that most people disagree with it. So, if others concerned don’t feel enough confidence to give me a run, it is in the nature of the case that I must retire from unequal combat.   Keynes discerned that one is unlikely to be able to consistently outperform the crowd when one is part of it—as Ben Graham advised, sustained success on the stock market can only be achieved by following an investment policy that is “(1) inherently sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.” Unlike some of his investment committee colleagues, Keynes realized that value investing is a matter of facts, not fashion—ascribing an intelligence to the masses, as if knowledge could be weighed rather than evaluated, is a sure path to underperformance.

- As an early value investor, Keynes believed that “‘Be Quiet’ is our best motto”—short-term price fluctuations could be ignored as mere “noise” and the disciplined investor should patiently wait for the market to reassert itself as a weighing machine rather than a voting machine.The only rational response to irrational mob behavior, he determined, was to let the game players have the short term to themselves, while Keynes instead practiced a policy of “steadiness” in respect of his select portfolio of shares.

- Teddy Roosevelt, the trust-busting American President of the early twentieth century, once averred that “there is no moral difference between gambling at cards or in lotteries or on the race track and gambling in the stock market.” Keynes disagreed with this assessment—he thought that gambling on the stock market was far more deleterious to a nation’s health than the innocent pleasures of the track or the gambling den. In an appearance before a Royal Commission in 1932, he argued that “it is much better that gambling should be associated with frivolous matters of no great significance rather than be bound up with the industry and trade of the country.” Keynes believed that racecourses and the like were a relatively harmless safety valve for the speculative urge. “Industrial betting” on stock exchanges, on the other hand, could lead to “the whole of [a nation’s] industry becoming a mere by-product of a casino.” Keynes contrasted the socially destructive effects of stock market game players with those of speculators in the commodity and currency markets.This latter class of speculator, Keynes asserted, provided “a useful, indeed almost an essential, service” by providing certainty in otherwise risky situations: ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2328))

- Where risk is unavoidably present, it is much better that it should be carried by those who are qualified or are desirous to bear it, than by traders, who have neither the qualification nor the desire to do so, and whose minds it distracts from their own business.   In contrast, the “proper social purpose” of the stock market was, as Keynes explained, “to direct new investment into the most profitable channels in terms of future yield.” The price performance of a stock will influence not only the ability of the underlying company to raise capital on the equity market, but will also affect the company’s borrowing capacity, its ability to make acquisitions, and the types of strategies it seeks to implement. A fundamental tenet of discriminating capitalism is that the stock market should reward those businesses that are the most successful. Success in the capitalist system is defined in brutally reductionist terms—the ability to earn sustainable profits over time. Only “enterprise” investing, where the investment decision is informed by an estimate of the total prospective yield of a security, facilitates this social purpose. Stock market speculation—which, as Ben Graham remarked, “is largely a matter of A trying to decide what B, C, and D are likely to think—with B, C, and D trying to do the same”—merely serves to distort capital flows, by potentially diverting capital and kudos away from performing businesses. As Keynes noted in The General Theory, “The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future.” In Keynes’ perfect world, the stock market would be populated by individuals buying securities “for keeps,” based on “long-term forecasts of the probable yield of an investment over its whole life”—not by trigger-fingered game players attempting to anticipate short-term swings in mass psychology.

- The “rule of 72” neatly illustrates the exponential increases available from compounding. Dividing the number 72 by the yield earned on an investment provides a close approximation of the amount of time required for a sum of income-earning capital to double in value—for example, a sum yielding 6 percent return per year, if re-invested, will double in twelve years, and an asset with a 9 percent per annum yield will double in value in only eight years.

- Even from a relatively early age, Keynes viewed brokers and investment managers in an unfavorable light. In Indian Currency and Finance, his first book, Keynes asked rhetorically:   . . . how long will it be found necessary to pay City men so entirely out of proportion to what other servants of society commonly receive for performing social services not less useful or difficult? Later in life, he advised his nephew—just setting out in the world of investment—not to take any notice of brokers’ suggestions. Keynes hinted that a type of reverse Darwinism operated among the broking fraternity, a survival of the dimmest. “After all,” he reasoned with his young charge, “one would expect brokers to be wrong. If, in addition to their other inside advantages, they were capable of good advice, clearly they would have retired a long time ago with a large fortune.” The Berkshire Hathaway duo share Keynes’ distaste for the financial advisory profession. Warren Buffett drolly notes that “Wall Street is the only place that people ride to work in a Rolls Royce to get advice from those who take the subway,” and Charlie Munger has drafted in Keynes to support his argument: I join John Maynard Keynes in characterizing investment management as a low calling. Because most of it is just shifting around a perpetual universe of common stocks.The people doing it just cancel each other out.   As Gordon Gekko, that famous demystifier of Wall Street, explained, stock market investing, in aggregate, is “a zero sum game—somebody wins, somebody loses.” Interposing another level of intermediaries must, therefore, necessarily reduce the aggregate returns available to investors as a whole. But brokers and investment managers exert a far more insidious effect on stock market game players.

- Brokers’ charges and other transaction costs do, however, possess one positive attribute—they may act as something of a brake on excessive trading, encouraging stock market players to think twice before buying and selling, thereby sparing them from a potentially more punitive cost. The various forms of “capital gains taxes”—a levy imposed on profits realized on the sale of assets, including stocks—are not in fact taxes on capital gains; rather, they are a transaction tax. An investor holding a stock that has improved in price merely incurs a nominal tax liability in respect of his gains—only when the security is sold will the tax liability crystallize. Buy-and-hold investors sometimes receive concessions on “long-term capital gains”—the tax rate may, for example, be lower for investments held for more than a year. In addition to this explicit reduction in the tax rate, deferring a tax liability can—due to the power of compounding—have significant positive effects on the after-tax value of an investor’s portfolio. An active market player who turns his portfolio over each year will incur an annual tax liability. The buy-and-hold investor, on the other hand, only incurs a theoretical tax liability for as long as he holds the stocks, and therefore still has his “before-tax” gains working for him—in effect, the investor receives an interest-free loan from the tax office. Due to the exponential effects of compounding, the buy-and-hold investor will—all other things being equal—record a significantly larger after-tax return. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are particularly fierce critics of the “self-inflicted wounds” sustained from excessive market activity. Buffett cautions that a “hyperactive stock market is the pickpocket of enterprise,” and Charlie Munger commends a policy of minimizing “… ([Location 2405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2405))

- Keynes, better than most, understood the fleeting but intense satisfactions of the successful speculator. Writing in The General Theory with the guilty knowledge of the poacher-turned-gamekeeper, he observed that “human nature desires quick results . . . and remoter gains are discounted by the average man at a very high rate.” It was upon this psychological peculiarity—now pathologized as the condition of “hyperbolic discounting” by the behavioral finance fraternity—that Keynes laid the foundation for his tremendous stock market success in the latter part of his investment career. Not only was a long-term horizon consistent with an investment policy based on realizing the latent potential of underpriced stocks, but this “steadiness” also protected the investor from transaction costs that can seriously erode the capital of the active investor.

- Like his forebear, Maynard Keynes also believed that investing heavily in a few “pets” would typically deliver much better returns than an indiscriminate policy of diversification. Keynes was repeatedly reprimanded for making big plays on only a small number of stocks. In response to criticism from a colleague at Provincial for purchasing “a large and exceptional unit” in a shipping company, Keynes bristled:   Sorry to have gone too large in Elder Dempster . . . I was . . . suffering from my chronic delusion that one good share is safer than ten bad ones, and I am always forgetting that hardly anyone else shares this particular delusion. The price has, I think, now gone up by about 6d, so you can get rid of any surplus without loss that you would like to.   In his indomitably contrarian way, Keynes rejected the orthodox view that an optimal stock portfolio is one that is widely diversified. Conventional financial theory decrees that markets are efficient—that is, all stocks are correctly valued and one stock is just as likely as another to rise or fall in price in response to unknowable future events. Building on this assumption, accepted wisdom argues that it is better to hold a large number of stocks so as to minimize the impact of random underperformance by any particular share. Diversification is the stock market application of the maxim “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Keynes, like Warren Buffett after him, did not agree with this approach—he thought that a patient and informed investor could select a small group of “ultra favourites” having “prospects of rising enormously more than an index of market leaders.” When these few “stunners”—or, as Buffett calls them, “superstars” and “grand-slam home runs”—are periodically thrown up by the market, intelligent investors should not be afraid to invest a relatively large proportion of their funds in these stocks. Accordingly, in the latter half of his investment career Keynes maintained an extremely compact stock portfolio, with over half the value of his total stockholding represented by the shares of only a few firms. For his faith in portfolio concentration, Keynes was rewarded with an investment performance far superior—albeit more volatile—than that of the broader market. Basket Case I puts it all away, some here, some there, and none too much any-wheres, by reason of suspicion. —LONG JOHN SILVER, IN ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON’S TREASURE ISLAND Portfolio diversification is essentially a defensive strategy—by spreading funds between a large number of stocks, the extent to which poorly performing shares affect overall portfolio value is reduced. Further, the greater the diversification within a stock portfolio—that is, the more representative it becomes of the market as a whole—the lesser the risk of underperforming relative to the market. This outcome is important to both orthodox theorists and the average investor.

- Keynes thought that, for an individual who cannot or will not rigorously apply the precepts of value investing, “it ought to be considered as imprudent for such a man to make his own investments as to be his own doctor or lawyer.” For these investors, index funds—investment vehicles that mimic broad market performance by building an appropriately weighted portfolio of stocks—offer low-cost exposure to the stock market. As Buffett explained to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, an unsophisticated investor seeking “to be a long-term owner of . . . industry” should: . . . both own a large number of equities and space out his purchases. By periodically investing in an index fund, for example, the know-nothing investor can actually out-perform most investment professionals. Paradoxically, when “dumb” money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb. ([Location 2501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2501))

- This biblical injunction to go forth and diversify reflects the conventional reaction to uncertainty—moderate risks by diluting them as much as practicable. Diversification is, in reality, more a strategy of risk dispersion than risk reduction. Keynes’ response to uncertainty and risk in the share market was radically different to the prevailing wisdom—as he explained in a letter to one of his business associates:   . . . my theory of risk is that it is better to take a substantial holding of what one believes shows evidence of not being risky rather than scatter holdings in fields where one has not the same assurance.   To ascertain which stocks “show evidence of not being risky,” the value investor searches for those securities that exhibit a sufficiently large margin of safety—that is, those stocks with a substantial gap between estimated intrinsic value and the quoted price. In undertaking this analysis, the intelligent investor will necessarily focus only on those businesses he or she understands. Keynes noted that he would prefer “one investment about which I had sufficient information to form a judgment to ten securities about which I know little or nothing.” His contention was that intelligent, informed investors will reduce their downside risk by scrutinizing only those sectors within their “circle of competence”—to use Buffett’s phrase—and then only investing in those stocks which exhibit a satisfactory margin of safety. Like Socrates, the intelligent investor is wise because he recognizes the bounds of his knowledge. ([Location 2548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2548))

- The poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas—Einstein is said to have replied, “Oh, that’s not necessary—it’s so seldom I have one.” Similarly, opportunities to buy quality stocks at a material discount to fundamental value are infrequent. As stock investor and author Philip Fisher commented:   . . . practical investors usually learn their problem is finding enough outstanding investments, rather than choosing among too many . . . Usually a very long list of securities is not a sign of the brilliant investor, but of one who is unsure of himself.   Agreeing that “ultra-favorites” are usually thin on the ground, Keynes noted that “there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.” ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2597))

- For an investor who—like Keynes and Buffett—adopts a buy-and-hold policy in respect of stocks, portfolio concentration is something that tends to happen naturally over time. Inevitably, some stocks within a portfolio will perform better than others and these “stunners” will come to constitute a large proportion of total value. A policy of portfolio concentration cautions against an instinctive desire to “re-balance” holdings just because an investor’s stock market investments are dominated by a few companies. Buffett illustrates this point with an analogy. If an investor were to purchase a 20 percent interest in the future earnings of a number of promising basketball players, those who graduate to the NBA would eventually represent the bulk of the investor’s royalty stream. Buffett says that:   To suggest that this investor should sell off portions of his most successful investments simply because they have come to dominate his portfolio is akin to suggesting that the Bulls trade Michael Jordan because he has become so important to the team. Buffett cautions against selling off one’s “superstars” for the rather perverse reason that they have become too successful. The decision to sell or hold a security should be based solely on an assessment of the stock’s expected future yield relative to its current quoted price, rather than any measure of past performance.

- However, for all his enthusiasm for a compact portfolio, even Keynes conceded that the principle of concentration “ought not to be carried too far.” Keynes accepted that the maintenance of “a balanced investment position” justified a certain degree of diversification within any stock holding. He defined a “balanced position” as one in which there were:   . . . a variety of risks in spite of individual holdings being large, and if possible opposed risks (e.g. a holding of gold shares amongst other equities, since they are likely to move in opposite directions when there are general fluctuations).   A portfolio of stocks with opposed risk characteristics—to take another example, oil producers and airline companies—will serve to offset, at least in part, the effect of unforeseen and unpredictable shocks to any particular security. Additionally, investors may obtain some of the benefits of diversification, while still maintaining a focused portfolio, by spreading their capital between different asset classes—by holding not only stocks but also, for example, investments in property or bonds. Although Keynes’ wealth was particularly concentrated in the stock market—he never owned a house or any other form of real property, and by the time of his death his securities portfolio represented over 90 percent of his total assets—most other investors display a preference for considerably less reliance on just one asset class. “Sell down to your sleeping point,” the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan reportedly advised a friend whose slumber was being compromised due to worries about his stock portfolio. Similarly, most value investors may elect to adopt a slightly more wide-ranging investment approach than that of Keynes.

- Contrary to conventional financial wisdom, Keynes argues that a focused portfolio should be less risky than a diversified portfolio, as investors will restrict their analysis to those stocks within their circle of competence and will also demand a wide margin of comfort prior to allocating a substantial proportion of total funds to a single stock. It is ironic that in the high temple of capitalism, Adam Smith’s commandment to specialize has been so comprehensively ignored. Dismissing the dogma of diversification, Keynes noted in a letter to the Chairman of the Provincial Insurance Company that:   As time goes on I get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes. It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence.   The level of investment risk in respect of a particular stock, Keynes emphasized, was commensurate with the level of ignorance and uncertainty surrounding that security.Value investing inverts the risk-return trade-off suggested in orthodox texts—those stocks offering the greatest apparent margin of safety, and therefore by definition the least downside risk, also potentially offer the greatest returns. By “loading up” only in respect of “stunners,” as Keynes suggested, investors should both reduce the riskiness of their portfolio and give themselves the best chance of outperformance relative to the broader market.

- Keynes cautioned that:   One must not allow one’s attitude to securities which have a daily market quotation to be disturbed by this fact or lose one’s sense of proportion. Some Bursars will buy without a tremor unquoted and unmarketable investments in real estate which, if they had a selling quotation for immediate cash available at each Audit, would turn their hair gray. The intelligent investor, Keynes asserted, maintains “a sense of proportion” by accepting that for sustained periods a stock’s price may split from its underlying value. The investor is not overwhelmed by constant price quotation, by Mr. Market’s ceaseless urgings to buy or sell. Rather, the disciplined investor applies his or her own analysis in identifying mispriced stocks and adheres to a long-term time horizon, confident that the stock market will eventually revert to its professed role as a machine for crystallizing expected future cash flows and, ultimately, will reward those businesses with a sustainable earnings profile. The value investor must, as a colleague noted of Keynes’ own temperament, maintain a “robust faith in the ultimate rightness of a policy based on reason and common sense.” ([Location 2730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2730))

- The intelligent investor, by focusing only on those stocks within his or her circle of competence, will in fact be far more attuned to shifts in their relative value than market participants monitoring a much wider universe of securities. And by concentrating on a smaller pool of stocks, the value investor is in a better position to make a judgment on the merits of a particular security and act decisively. One observer of Keynes’ methods with the King’s College Chest Fund noted that:   The great point about King’s has been that when a good opportunity is pointed out to them, they “go for it.”The swiftness of decision which marked their policy is due to Mr. Keynes.   Nicholas Davenport, a fellow board member at National Mutual, agreed that Keynes’ stock market success was due to “beating the other fellow to the gun,” adding that “I have never known a man so quick off the mark in the stock exchange race.” Value investing, conducted properly, is not unlike Keynes’ beloved cricket—vast longueurs occasionally punctuated by episodes of intense activity.

- To take an extreme example, an investor buying a security on a 10 percent margin—that is, 90 percent of the purchase price is supported by borrowings—requires just a 10 percent increase in stock price to double his or her money. But with this greater potential reward comes a commensurate increase in risk—a 10 percent decline in price will effectively wipe out all the investor’s capital contribution. Leverage works when markets are rising but can be catastrophic when they are falling. Margin loans and other forms of credit are an essential adjunct to many speculators’ tool kits—they often work on fine margins, and borrowing funds allows them to raise the stakes on their stock market wagers. The power of leverage gives these game players the chance to potentially magnify capital profits, while “market liquidity” confers the illusion that there exists a fire escape should things get too hot. The problem with fire escapes, however, is that they do not work particularly well when everyone is rushing the door at the same time. Those who believe that they can divine the tides of sentiment are often caught short when the market suddenly turns. Empirical evidence has, broadly speaking, failed to identify any single news factor that could explain some of the great “corrections” of the last century: the Crash of October 1929, “Black Monday” in 1987, the bursting of the dot-com bubble in March 2000. Those investors with leveraged positions—where market exposure far exceeded real capital resources—found themselves with financial obligations they simply could not meet. As Warren Buffett dryly comments, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.” Value investors—those who buy a stock on the expectation that, in the longer term, its quoted price will rise to meet intrinsic value—are particularly circumscribed when it comes to borrowings. Keynes observed that the market can stay irrational longer than game players can stay solvent—Alan Greenspan, after all, made his famous “irrational exuberance” remark a full three years before the dot-com bubble finally burst.The value investor must therefore be prepared to wait potentially considerable periods before the stock market weighing machine usurps the voting machine. Keynes consequently concluded that:   . . . an investor who proposes to ignore near-term market fluctuations needs greater resources for safety and must not operate on so large a scale, if at all, with borrowed money . . .   Something of a debt junkie in the 1920s and early 1930s, Keynes considerably reduced his borrowings in the latter part of his investment career, with loans constituting around 10 percent of his assets in the last years of his life.This financial conservatism is repeated in the practices of Berkshire Hathaway, which, as Charlie Munger comments, is “chicken about buying stocks on margin.” As Munger suggests, “The ideal is to borrow in a way no temporary thing can disturb you.” ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KAM6SI&location=2801))

- Cultivating the correct temperament—one that couples, in Buffett’s words, “good business judgment with an ability to insulate . . . thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace”—requires the investor to focus on just two variables, the price and the intrinsic value of a stock.

- Similarly, the investor does not succumb to the trait of overconfidence. Adam Smith, in his seminal work The Wealth of Nations, wryly remarked on:   The overweening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities . . . and . . . their absurd presumption in their own good fortune . . .There is no man living, who, when in tolerable health and spirits, has not some share of it. The chance of gain is by every man more or less overvalued, and the chance of loss is by most men undervalued . . .   Empirical evidence supports Smith’s insight—individuals typically exaggerate their skills (to take an everyday example, considerably more than half of survey respondents believe they are much better drivers than the average motorist), and harbor overly optimistic views in respect of future events (research has shown, for instance, that game show contestants massively overestimate their chances of success).
