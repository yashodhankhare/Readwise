- So, what can money managers do to improve their competitive records? More of the same? If so, they would have fallen prey to the “streetlamp syndrome,” captured in the story about the fellow who preferred to look under the streetlamp for his keys—rather than in the alley where he lost them—because the light was better under the lamp. These change-resistant money managers would also be guilty of behaving insanely, defined as follows: “doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get different results.” ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=215))

- governed by habits (Larsen, Stage II Recovery, HarperCollins 1985). The point here is that unless we change our habits, our exercise program will have little effect. And if we expect to get different results from doing the same thing over and over, then we are fooling ourselves. Remember the definition of insanity: doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. (For example, mixing SlimFast with Ben & Jerry’s ice cream for your diet breakfast.)

- Edward DeBono, a leading expert on creative thinking, asserts that the biggest myth about creativity is that humans are naturally creative (DeBono, Serious Creativity, HarperCollins 1992). We aren’t. We are creatures of habit. So this is where the definition of insanity applies. Investors must be willing to examine their results and ask, “Is my approach working?” If not, something must change. A mental fitness program for investors would involve identifying and changing unproductive habits. What would such a program look like? Success in investing depends on the quality of our thinking. That is the skill a superior investor brings to the table. Michael Jordan brought superior physical skills (great agility and great eyesight); Elle McPherson has great physical beauty; Warren Buffett has superior decision-making skills based on his quality of thinking. What components of Buffett’s thinking produce these superior decisions? He reads the same financial press and studies the same finance and investment concepts as most other investors, but somehow he ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=288))

For those of you who like step-by-step, one-size-fits-all formulas, I’m sorryno can do. As with physical fitness, each person’s program must be tailored to his or her own body and health. But I can explain the concepts so that you can start to tailor your own program. Returning to the question, “How does he do that?” I chose not only Buffett but also four other investment masters to study. I looked for common threads in their thinking styles, so that use-ful generalizations could be made. The chosen five had to meet three criteria: 1. They had to have exemplary performance records over a long period of time. 2. There had to be enough information available about them so that I could understand and analyze their thinking styles. 3. Their investment approaches had to be sufficiently different from the other four. The last factor was included because I didn’t want the discussion to end up focusing on the ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=296))

As with physical fitness programs, this mental fitness program requires a genuine commitment to achieve any real gain. Those who have made that commitment, though, have seen the benefits. Successful investing, then, is the result of superior thinking combined with a reasonable approach. Different approaches can win in the market. The question becomes this: What qualities or habits do the truly successful investors share? Underneath their educational training, advanced degrees, IQs, and so on, what underlying factors separate them from the rest of us?

- way of saying that they must master complexity. Many of us have well-developed preferences for one or the other poles, but not equal facility with both—and that is why we fail to achieve superior results. Sherlock Holmes said, “My peculiar art of detection results from the interplay of reality and imagination.” He meant that he had both observational and creative abilities. He could take in the facts and then play with them to see beyond them to the truth that we “Watsons” cannot perceive. To give a sense of how complexity plays out with our master investors, Figure 3.1 shows some examples of them going to each polar extreme. FIGURE 3.1 Complexity through opposition. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=524))

- Without an understanding of complexity, the statements in the figure are confusing. The masters appear to be speaking out of both sides of their mouths. (Sort of like the man who said, “I used to be schizophrenic, but we’re better now.”) Their statements make sense only in the light of complexity. When viewed this way, they are showing that they can dribble with either hand, or—to use a tennis metaphor—that they can hit a backhand and a forehand equally well.

- Fortunately, there is a tool that can help in the process of attaining complexity in thinking. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) assessment tool, which has been around for more than 50 years and has been taken by more than 10 million people worldwide, measures these same polarities in thinking. First conceived of by psychologist Carl Jung, the MBTI assessment tool was developed into the practical version that we use today by Katherine Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Myers. The tool measures the way we prefer to use our minds. Similar to left- and right-handedness, ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=578))

- The balance between the inner and outer world is important to successful investing. The single biggest tool that we all possess to maintain the balance is awareness—simply paying attention. If we know our natural tendency and consciously work to balance it, we will be more likely to win in the markets. Do you know how much time you spend trying products and talking to people versus reading and thinking? Try keeping a diary for a week and check the ratio.

- My stretch as an introvert was to balance the amount of time reading and studying reports with an equal amount of time kicking the tires.

- One of the most frequently recommended techniques for tapping into intuition is to learn a simple meditation technique, such as the relaxation response studied by Herbert Benson, a Harvard M.D. (this is meant to persuade the sensing and thinking types who are a bit skeptical of ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=903))

- anything mystical and want some evidence and credentials). The idea in meditation is to shut off outside distractions so that one can tune in to that “wee small voice” that the Quakers speak of. The mystics tell us that the mind is strongest when it is still. (“Be still and know that I am God.”) Meditation helps quiet the mind. Edison’s method of tapping into the unconscious was novel. He seemed to know that the unconscious was a precious source of creative solutions, so he devised the following strategy. He would sit in a comfortable chair with rocks in his hands and pans on the floor under the rocks. Then he would doze off. The rocks would fall, hitting the pans and waking him. He would try to recall where his thoughts had been as he drifted off to sleep. Author Sandra Weintraub reports that her surveys of inventors show that 75 percent use their dreams to invent new products. Skeptical sensing types need to open themselves up to the reservoir of knowledge that is “hidden” within. I will have more to say on this in Parts 3 and 4, the chapters on creativity and intuition.

- The problem for thinking types occurs when the emotions flare up, as they inevitably do. An example with a colleague, the portfolio manager mentioned earlier, makes the point. He had bought a large position in an initial public offering (IPO) of PharMor (a discount drug retailer). For a while he looked like a hero. Earnings were impressive. The stock moved up nicely. But then news turned negative on the stock and the price plunged. It turns out that the company had acted fraudulently. The manager exploded, taking it as a personal affront: “How could they have lied to me, those bastards!” Given his rather low “emotional intelligence” quota, he stomped into the trading room and told them to sell the entire position. Even though the traders, who had cooler heads, showed some concern about his order, he paid no heed and blew out his entire position, several million dollars, in an afternoon. That volume of stock drove the price down ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=925))

- further as traders reacted to his orders. In short order, though, the stock rebounded and returned to its trading range. By reacting emotionally, this portfolio manager cost his firm more than $200,000. That’s an expensive emotional indulgence.

- The weaknesses are apparent. Judging types can be too rigid, too attached to the old ways. Many articles in the financial press lately have pointed out that the old valuation techniques don’t work anymore. People who buy AOL or eToys aren’t playing by the same old rules. The inability to change can hurt performance significantly. The Wall Street Journal ran a story about a mutual-fund manager who uses a value approach to stock selection. He looks for “cheap” stocks. His portfolio has been underperforming ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=954))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and the money in his portfolio has shrunk from nearly $8 billion to about half that in two years. When asked about the high-flying technology stocks, Mr. Sanborn’s reaction is typical of someone with a preference for judging: “The thought of buying such overpriced shares is some-thing that I’ll never do. … It’s like having a religion” (Wall Street Journal, Jan. 3, 2000). Similarly, Zweig, one of the masters, agrees that we should never “fight the tape.” Yet Zweig also says that the biggest reason why novice investors fail is their inability to be flexible. So which is it? Actually, it’s the proper mix of the two, which we’ve defined as complexity. The other side of the coin—from judgers and their strict adherence to a certain discipline—is perceivers who waffle between disciplines. I’ve worked in firms where the portfolio managers chased the latest fad, always seeming to be a day late and a few hundred million short. As sectors of the market come in and out of favor, the perceivers invariably jump on too late and get off too late, missing the excess returns and wondering why this pattern feels so familiar. (Because, as perceivers, they’ve probably done it a ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=958))

- dozen times before.) The trick for perceivers is to establish some methods for discipline and stick to them. Perhaps not rigidly, but enough to establish a pedigreed rather than mongrel investing style. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=968))

- For all the polarities, the right amount of one versus the other is the magical quality that we might call wisdom. The first step to attaining that ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=986))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- wisdom is recognition and understanding of the different choices. Simply put, investors need to become conscious of the decision process. Now that we’ve established a way of looking at the investment decision process, and done some consciousness-raising, let’s focus on the next question: What is the ideal personality style for the professional investor? ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=987))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Perhaps there would be more than one ideal type. Maybe there would be one for trading, one for analysis, one for risk arbitrage. I was hopeful, so I dug in and read everything I could find about the masters. But my hope faded as I read more about the personality types of the masters and realized that they differed. I shifted to a new hypothesis: These masters achieved greatness because they understood their own personality type and used an investment approach that was congruent with it. Of course, that was it. Socrates and Shakespeare were right after all: Know thyself and then to thine own self be true. One investment writer, Derrick Niederman, has already written a book, The Inner Game of Investing (Wiley 1999), that elaborates on this theory. He does not base it on the MBTI assessment, but instead describes investment styles that he invented: The Bargain ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1013))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Hunter, The Visionary, The Contrarian, The Sentimentalist, and so on. It’s a fun book, a good airplane read—but I wasn’t satisfied with Niederman’s “to thine own self be true” theory either. As I continued to study the masters, it became obvious that they were more than just good at their “own thing.” They exhibited the quality of complexity or genius that Csikszentmihalyi wrote about in his book on creative genius (see Chapter 3). The masters can move to either extreme of the polarities, one minute thinking in broad, big-picture concepts, the next minute picking nits in an earnings report to see if the footnote explains an accounting change. Eventually, I abandoned the notion that one personality style was better for investing success than another. All personality styles can be winners in the market, but they must understand their own strengths and weaknesses and compensate accordingly. This sort of self-knowledge leads to wisdom and personal mastery. The five experts that I’ve chosen to discuss have demonstrated abilities in all eight of the Myers-Briggs preferences: sensing and intuiting, judging and perceiving, and so forth. Later in this book, then, we will deal with the preference that seems most difficult for all of us: creativity and intuition. For now, though, let’s ask another question about personality types: Which one is the most typical for investors?

- The most common personality type for professional investors is Sensing, Thinking, and Judging (STJ), in MBTI jargon. (There is no clear majority on the Extravert/Introvert scale, with each preference being about equally represented.) My own experience in working with investment ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1040))

- groups (more than 500 individuals) supports this “STJ” assertion. Experts in the field of psychology also support this view: “If you had to brand fund managers with psycho jargon, they’d be STJ on the widely used Myers-Briggs personality test.” (Ted Bililies, psychologist) “Finance and administration are very likely to be STJ departments.” (William Bridges, author) The implications for the industry are profound. In fact, some evidence suggests that a major shift is occurring. Firms that are unaware of the shift may end up on the scrap heap of mutual funds. First off, STJ personalities are very one-sided in their thinking, based on the famous left-right brain hemisphere work done by Roger Sperry. (He received the Nobel prize for his research and discovery of the bicameral brain functions.) This means that STJ types tend to be detail-oriented, logical, precise, efficient, decisive, and organized. Sounds pretty powerful, right? Robert Moore, a well-known Jungian analyst, thinks so. He calls these types “lions.” They are typically very effective and powerful people. They are “go-to” people who can get the job done. They have a take-no-prisoners ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1042))

- this preference by strengthening the right side. Herein lies the problem. Consider a piece of research that I’ve conducted with groups. I’ve divided the lions (left-brainers) and the jesters (right-brainers) into their respective groups and asked them to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. When they report back on strengths, the lions have no trouble listing them: detail-oriented, logical, decisive, and so on. The jesters usually report: creative, intuitive, open-minded, adaptable, and so on. Both groups are then asked to consider their weaknesses. The jesters come back with a long list: flaky, dreamy, too sentimental, deadline-dysfunctional, and others. Now, here’s the interesting finding: When the lions are supposed to report their weaknesses, they stare at one another, furrow their brows, and shrug their shoulders. No weaknesses. At first blush, this response may seem highly arrogant or… ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1061))

- first, getting the right answer—all the things at which left-brainers naturally excel. So, of course, they tend to think that they’re doing life “correctly.” Roger Sperry, the originator of the left-right brain theory, believes that there is a huge untapped resource for most people in the right hemisphere, as a result of this societal emphasis: “Our educational system and modern society generally discriminate against one whole half of the brain. In our present educational system, the attention given to the right hemisphere of the brain is minimal compared with the training lavished on the left side.” Increasingly, research is validating the importance of the interplay between the left and right brain. For example, a new form of psychological treatment called Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) is based on the interplay between the two hemispheres. It has proven very… ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1071))

- the early research was done with Vietnam veterans who had posttraumatic stress syndrome. The success rate was nearly 80 percent, versus less than 50 percent for all other forms of therapy.) The point? Our quest for flexible and effective thinking must include use of the whole brain, much like EMDR does in healing the psyche. Lions must overcome their comfortable position as the darlings of American culture if they want to be at the top of their game. Another consequence of the lion’s leadership is often a limited view of creativity. I distinguish two types of creativity, capital C and small c. Creativity with a capital C is the kind that leads to breakthrough thinking and new models. Right-brainers tend to thrive on busting old models and creating new ones. They want to move from trains to planes, from bricks-and-mortar to clicks-and-mortar.

- Well, there is no question that it is more difficult to beat the market today. In the 1980s, the rule-of-thumb number was that about a third of professional managers beat the market. In the 1990s, that number dropped to 20 percent, and then down to less than 10 percent. Why is the market getting progressively harder to beat? One answer is that the market represents the collective wisdom of the investment community, including their tools and information. As investors have become more knowledgeable and better informed, all the while using more powerful tools, the bar has been raised. The importance of higher-quality thinking becomes obvious in this scenario. But what kind of thinking? When I started in the investment business in 1979, my first assignment, as an equity research ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1126))

(He then checked my results and corrected my answer, which left me wondering why he had given me the assignment in the first place.) I progressed in this job to producing spreadsheets of earnings forecasts for various companies—again by hand, with a calculator, erasing the old assumptions and pencilling in the new numbers. In short, I was a glorified computer. I was doing the left-brain, logical number crunching that computers excel at, and for this I was paid reasonably well. Why is it that computers can beat chess champions like Gary Kasparov and bridge experts like Omar Sharif? Because computers never forget and never make careless mistakes. Therefore, the value of humans with these sorts of left-brained skills is minimal. Computers can now crank out results that are cheap and error-free. Creative right-brain thinking is different. So far, no computer can match the right brain’s capacity to synthesize new information and create ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1133))

- new models. The Wall Street Journal picked up on this idea in an article entitled, “A New Model for the Nature of Business: It’s Alive!” (Feb. 26, 1999). The idea in the article is that a major shift is occurring in thinking about business, away from the mechanistic model to an organic model. Some of the comparisons are shown in Figure 7.2. FIGURE 7.2 Business model comparison. What struck me as most significant, though, was the final comparison, labeled “Main economic constraint.” It used to be capital. Money. Without dough, no business could be successfully launched. The constraint has now become creativity. No longer is it necessary to find angels with deep pockets to start new ventures.

Try this riddle: It is greater than God It is more evil than the devil Rich people need it Poor people have it If you eat it you will die. What is “it?” After you’ve thought about it for a minute, consider the following. When I pose this riddle to workshop participants, I tell them that it was given to a group of kindergarten kids and a group of Stanford MBAs. I then tell them that 80 percent of the kids got the answer, whereas only 17 percent of the MBAs did. (Oh yes, what is the answer? Nothing. Try it out, you’ll see!) As I’m naturally skeptical, I wasn’t sure I believed this research about Stanford MBAs, so I tried it out on a friend’s 10-year-old. He was playing a computer game.

The people who talk too much don’t realize it, the people who tell humorless jokes, the people who write boring investment books … oops. The reason for this might appear mysterious at first, but the explanation is really pretty simple. To judge our performance accurately, we would have to know what it means to perform badly.

A non-zero-sum game allows cooperation. There are moves that benefit both players, and this is what makes these games interesting.) In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, two suspects are picked up by the police and interrogated in separate cells without a chance to communicate with each other. For the purpose of this game, it makes no difference whether the suspects actually committed the crime. They are both told the same thing: If you both snitch on each other, you will both get three years in prison. If neither of you snitches, the police will have no evidence and you will both go free. If one of you snitches but the other doesn’t, the snitcher will make a deal with the police and will go free while the other one goes to jail for six years. At first glance the correct strategy appears obvious. No matter what the other suspect does, you’ll be better off informing (“snitching”).

Various analysts were peppering management with questions, all aimed at exposing the mother lode of hidden value or sham. There was a pause for just a moment, and then LeBaron lobbed his question from the back of the room. To this day I can’t remember what the question was—I wish I could. What I do remember was a sea of blank analyst faces, with their heads cocked like listening dogs, all clueless as to what LeBaron was talking about. All except the chief financial officer of Intel.

I stopped the group and told them the story about the fellow moving his piano: A man is moving his piano. It’s half in and half out of his apartment. He struggles and struggles and works and works. Finally, a neighbor walks by and offers to help. The owner sighs and says, “Great.” The two of them struggle for half an hour without any gain.

Probably, as an intervention, the leader in the room would have taken over and steered the decision making (consciously or not) in a direction that he liked. To say the least, this does not produce the best collaborative results. The process for improving investment decision making, then, is to recognize the different personality styles and develop some skill in using the filters during discussions. As an aid in this skill development, Figure 10.2 lists some typical words associated with the different filters. Teams that really want to learn the skills should consider the kind of training that Interaction Associates and other organizations offer.

- In the markets we face today, as soon as winning strategies are identified, the market “morphs” to absorb them and render them ineffective. Winning strategies have to be designed to stay a step ahead, continually reinventing the next version of the strategy. It seems that almost all information is available instantaneously now. On the Internet, for example, you can find out not only how many trees are growing in North Dakota, but also how many red-headed woodpeckers are living on each one of them. The Internet represents a huge collective consciousness. And guess what? You are up against that giant brain. Now, I ask that old geezer in the print ad—the one saying, “9,763 stocks. I like my odds.”: Do you still like your odds? But there is still another way in which the market is changing that makes it harder to predict and, therefore, to win. This second way involves the personality styles that we’ve been discussing. The mix is changing. Let me use John Maynard Keynes’s beauty contest analogy to explain how: [P]rofessional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1724))

- one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth, and higher degrees [Keynes, The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 1936]. Let’s apply Keynes’s metaphor to the current markets. Today we have more people playing the markets and greater diversity of personalities than ever before. (Traditionally, it was mostly lions playing the market and running the big firms. Now, there are nearly 100 million participants in the market. There are only about 50 million lions in the United States, so that means half the market now is nonlion.) Imagine Keynes’s beauty contest with all white females and white males as beauties and judges, respectively. This was like the market of the mid-20th century in America: mostly lion investors buying lion-run companies. Now, enter some diversity. Imagine that the females pictured are equally divided between Caucasian, African, Asian, and Indian. ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1737))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Likewise, the judges are equally divided. If a Caucasian male did not alter his approach to the market based on the new diversity, then he might well pick mostly Caucasian females, because he is used to that. He will lose because the winning pictures will probably reflect the new diversity of the group. How does this metaphor relate to the current stock market? As noted earlier, investors with different styles are entering the markets and voting with their dollars. As in the beauty contest, this increasing diversity will cause different stocks to be winners. Hence, it’s important to understand the personalities of the new market players. We’ve discussed the lions earlier, but what of the other 50 million new players? What are their characteristics and how will their votes (i.e., dollars) affect the market? Some useful generalizations can be drawn from the earlier… ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=1746))

- The inner critic is the single biggest barrier to creativity. There fore, before we leap ahead to a discussion of group creativity, it’s important to cover the individual aspects of the process. How do you create safety within yourself? How do you tame the internal critic that gets its jollies by calling you stupid, denigrating your work, and tearing apart your best ideas? This topic is tricky because often the inner critic, like a hidden addiction, is cunning, baffling, and powerful. It works behind the scenes, quietly undermining your confidence and keeping your creativity at bay. Sadly, many people live their entire lives without realizing this. It’s like owning a car for 10 years and never knowing that the parking brake was on the entire time.

- so much faster and more efficient if only you had been aware of the problem and dealt with it! Instead, the car handled poorly and burned up lots of extra gasoline. How do we recognize and deal with the inner critic? Of all the material available for enhancing creativity, one of the most powerful is a book by two psychologists, Hal Stone and Sidra Stone, called Embracing Your Inner Critic (HarperCollins 1992). The subtitle is interesting for our purposes: Turning Self-Criticism into a Creative Asset. Why is the inner critic so harmful? Here is the list that the Stones call the “Top Twelve Traits of the Inner Critic.” As you can see, it starts with how damaging the critic is to creativity and risk-taking: 1. It constricts your ability to be creative. 2. It stops you from taking risks because it makes you fear failure. 3. It views your life as a series of mistakes waiting to happen. 4. It undermines your courage to change. 5. It compares you unfavorably with others and makes you feel inferior. 6. It is terrified of being shamed and monitors all your behavior to avoid this.

- 7. It causes you to suffer from low self-esteem, and possibly depression, because it tells you that you are not good enough. 8. It can make looking at yourself in a mirror or shopping for clothes miserable because of its ability to create such a negative view of the body. 9. It can take all the fun out of life with its criticisms. 10. It makes self-improvement a compulsive chore because it bases the work on the premise that something is wrong with you. 11. It doesn’t allow you to acknowledge or accept the good feelings that other people have toward you. 12. It makes you susceptible, and often victim, to the judgments of other people.

- other like throwing gasoline on the fire. Wasn’t there some middle way? The Stones had a very different approach, which worked for me. The Stones acknowledge the inner critic that lives within all of us (Freud called it the superego) and provide a process for transforming it into an ally. As I read the Stones’ book, I realized that the inner critic was like a compulsive habit for me. I couldn’t seem not to listen to it. I couldn’t shut it off. Like the drug addict who knows that heroin is destroying him, but uses it anyway, I judged myself continually. Why would I—or anyone—do that? It seems so stupid and unproductive. This is the part of the Stones’ explanation that I found unusually insightful. They believe that our internal critic is actually a misguided ally, trying to help us; rather than some evil spirit trying to destroy us. The critic is reacting to early life experiences and messages… ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2203))

Mostly these messages were useful only in our families of origin, where we were “guests” of our parents and had to play by their rules. As we grow up and go out into the world, these rules don’t serve us anymore. If we are going to shine creatively, we have to stop seeking approval and being terrified of rejection, and trust our own intuition. Put simply, the critic is trying to protect us. Its job is to keep us safe, to keep us alive. It’s in this sense that the critic is the enemy of creativity. Why? Think for a second of a child’s world. Parents and school officials teach that conformity is good (“color within the lines”). Thus, children in our society associate being different with being bad or wrong. They receive disapproving looks from parents and questions like, “Why can’t you be like the others?” Why is… ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2214))

- being uncared for as a child means death. Not figuratively, but literally. Small children are terrified of abandonment because it means they will die. So, this progression goes all the way from being different to death. I believe that this “different = death” equation is what propels much of the critic’s “life-saving” behavior. The critic’s job is to keep us the same. How does this old software program in our psyche still run our lives today? The critic doesn’t go away just because we grow up. Like a dog that is trained to bark at strangers, it continues that behavior forever until it is retrained not to do it. Recently, I talked with a successful, middle-aged money manager who would love to leave the big, bureaucratic firm that he works for and start his own practice. Why doesn’t he? He’s scared. His critic is still barking like mad every time this man contemplates “being different” and leaving the traditional path.

True, in many ways it helped me build a good résumé, with high marks, good schools, promotions, and the like, but I wasn’t having much fun doing it, and I certainly wasn’t tapping into my full creativity.

Ask yourself, “In what ways do I criticize myself? What fears arise if I think of leading a much more adventurous, risky life? What beliefs do I hold that limit my creativity?” The Stones divide critics into three categories: lightweights, middleweights, and heavyweights. They believe that “Heavyweight Critics just hate us. They want us dead.”; The process for change that the Stones recommendand it worked for meis called Voice Dialogue. It can be verbal, with a friend or counselor, or written in the form of a journal. The essence of the process is simple: Treat your own internal critic like a person who needs a sympathetic ear. Listen with the same concern and attention that you would give to a friend or child who was describing a problem.

(This notion of the Aware Ego was playfully dealt with in a Seinfeld episode in which George referred to himself in the third person: “George doesn’t like it when he doesn’t get his way … “) One way to experiment with the Aware Ego is to write an account of your day in the third person. Imagine watching yourself go through the day and instead of writing, “then I went to the mall …”, write “then Sally went to the mall …” When I made this switch in my journaling it helped tremendously. I was able to stay neutral and take a sincere interest in the critic’s comments and what concerns underlay them. Otherwise, I would continually take the bait and end up in a battle. The critic, being part of you, knows exactly what your weak points are. It can hook you faster than a fly fisherman. My critic would say things to me like, “You call that a workout?

- Switching to the Aware Ego point of view, it was easier for me instead to respond, “What’s your point here? Why are you attacking?” Invariably the answer to this question involved the critic’s fear that somehow “Jim’s” behavior had put everybody in danger. Critics respond to fear. That’s when they attack. That’s also why it is so hard for people to change: because all change involves fear, and fear activates the critic. The critic, being clever and knowledgeable about all your weak spots, will convince you to stay put. Change is tough because you are battling a worthy opponent—and creativity is a form of change, a new way of seeing things. Therefore, creativity is nearly impossible if you have a strong inner critic.

As I said earlier, in my own creative work this transformation from critic to ally has made all the difference. It has been hugely freeing. An example? I rarely suffer from the dreaded writer’s block now.

- again later that day. Creating this personal safety has been the key. A word of caution. I showed this material to a colleague in the money management business and his response was, “I don’t have a problem censoring myself, I just let whatever I’m thinking fly.” Right. He does. Because of this, his coworkers blanch at the thought of brainstorming with him. His internal critic becomes an external critic, slicing and dicing others at will. If a person has a critic—internal or externalthat is running rampant, he won’t foster a safe environment for creativity. He probably won’t get the feedback that he needs to change anything, either. Why? Because he has already intimidated his coworkers, who are his main source of constructive feedback. A perfect example of this occurred in a consultation with the head of a bond department. We were discussing this issue of safety and openness. She… ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2326))

Glancing at the clock and then her appointment book, this very bright woman said, “I don’t know, but I’m getting tired of it.” Then, rising out of her chair, placing both fists on her desk, she added, “And some of their precious little worlds are going to get rocked if nothing changes.” Yikes, I thought.

- All strengths have corresponding weaknesses, and the downside of the investor’s natural skepticism is that it kills creativity. These samurai rarely put their swords down long enough to be playfully innocent. Being competent is a deep core value to many investment pros, so the idea of dropping their certainty and assuming nothing rubs all their fur and feathers the wrong way. The mere suggestion of exposing their ignorance is about as much fun as optical surgery with a butter knife. The behavioral finance folks have researched this phenomenon and named it. They call it “overconfidence.” (For once, psychologists came up with a name that Ockham would have loved.) The evidence for overconfidence is the sort that appeals to the strength of investors: analytic reasoning. Investors will listen to and quite possibly accept this sort of evidence as a reason to change. (We all know that the only people who like change are panhandlers and wet babies.) One of the leading figures in the field of behavioral finance, Amos Tversky, said that investors “are generally overconfident. They acquire too much confidence from the information that is available to them, and they think they are right much more often than they actually are” (Behavioral Finance and Decision Theory in Investment Management, AIMR Publications 1995). This sort of overconfidence results in famous bloopers like the ones listed earlier (“heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible,” etc.). These statements remind us that “the true obstacle to progress is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge,” to quote Daniel Boorstin of the Library of Congress. If you don’t believe that you are overconfident, try the quiz at the end of this chapter. Evidence for overconfident behavior comes from many fields.

- In the face of our rampant overconfidence, one of the best ego deflators in the investment world is Mark Hulbert, publisher of the Hulbert Financial Digest. He runs many rigorous statistical tests to see which investment newsletters are demonstrating true expertise in picking stocks and which are just lucky. Of the newsletters that he follows, 89 have been around for 10 years or more. Hulbert subjected the performance of these newsletters to a “runs test” to see if any of the funds could be credited with a hot hand for the period. In fact, three of the newsletters passed the test. ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2748))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Are these the true market savants? Does this mean that we should rush out and subscribe? Although many investors do exactly that, the answer is no. Hulbert explains that in this test you would expect to see four false positives. In other words, by sheer luck, four newsletters should have outperformed. Put another way, if you had 89 coin flippers, four of them would show “expertise” in coin flipping, even though we know that they would simply be experiencing good luck. Hulbert conducted the same study with newsletters that have five-year records and got similar results: 219 newsletters and 10 winners. But the number of false positives was predicted to be 11. What’s the conclusion? There is no evidence that any of the newsletters outperforms. Regardless, because of overconfidence, investors chase the latest winner, and marketers play on this behavior mercilessly. They advertise one-year performance numbers with a bullhorn from the tops of buildings. (Finally, their clatter woke up Arthur Levitt at the SEC, and he personally sent out a message warning firms about this practice.) David Dreman and Michael Berry also studied overconfidence and got similar results. In fact, their study, conducted in 1995, showed that analysts’ estimates were actually deteriorating in accuracy! The forecast error for estimates (that is, a prediction of by how much analyst estimates would miss the actual reported earnings) had moved from the 20-30 percent range up to more than 60 percent by 1990.

- Dreman also points out in his writings that analysts bolster their already inflated confidence by spending hours on additional research, collecting additional bits of information on companies. Typically this extra digging doesn’t improve the investment decision, but it does let the analyst sleep better. So what’s to be done? The quality of creative thinking can be enhanced only if investors practice letting go of their certainty. After all, thinking is the capacity to hold different points of view, to consider things from all sides, and finally to make a decision. Somehow in this culture, we got it just backward: We consider the smartest people to be the ones who are absolutely certain of their answers and can win any debate by outshouting their opponents. But holding fast to one idea and arguing blindly and vehemently for it is, ironically, not thinking at all. A good way to practice real thinking is to seek out intelligent people who hold opposite viewpoints. Listen carefully to their arguments, without trying to debate. Get in their shoes. Challenge yourself to understand deeply how an intelligent person could hold this opposite opinion. Use the skills of the sensing and thinking types to objectively dissect the arguments and see exactly where you disagree. This approach takes courage. Most of us don’t want to rock the foundation of our belief systems, but this adventure is ([Location 2763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2763))

- Change gears. Some of us get our best ideas while driving or jogging or showering. Albert Einstein used to wonder why he got his niftiest thoughts while shaving. One woman in a workshop said that she got her best ideas while walking in circles around a conference room and talking out loud, periodically stopping to jot something on a flip chart. Hey, whatever works. Changing gears refers to moving from the high-paced, focused mode to the slower-paced, flexible mode. The comedian John Cleese, in a short video on creativity, refers to these two modes as “closed” and “open.” They are both useful. Left-brainers tend to live in the closed mode, right-brainers in the open. When working on a deadline, the closed mode is ideal. Head down, door closed, no interruptions. The last thing you want when you’re in this mode is some “idea” person butting in and saying, “Have you thought about. …” Throw a heavy paperweight at them and make a mental note to mail-bomb their PCs—later. The problem in the fast-paced investment world is that we get stuck in the closed mode. We are always being asked to do more with less. We always have deadlines. The markets are always hectic. The pace is frantic. The mind races—and, as Theodore Roethke said, “A mind too active is no mind at all.” The stress levels tend to freeze us in repetitive patterns. Jack Treynor, an original thinker in the investment world, has an opinion on this. Jack notes about our habitual behavior that “patterns in the way active managers manage tend to become grooves—irrespective of their merits” (“Zero Sum,” Financial Analyst Journal, Jan./Feb. 1994). In other words, investors get stuck in ruts. Art Zeikel, formerly of Merrill Lynch, makes a similar point in an article in the Financial Analyst Journal (“Organizing for Creativity,” Nov./Dec. 1983). He says that professional investors go to the same schools, read the same books and reports, and follow the same valuation guidelines, so it’s no wonder that they tend to reach the same conclusions—and tend to get the same mediocre results. How do we as investors learn to change gears? How do we train ourselves to tap into the benefits of the open mode?

- As with most change, the first step is awareness. We need to understand that there are two modes, and we need to be aware of the importance of the open mode. Edward Jenner never would have discovered the vaccine for smallpox if he had focused only on sick people. His research with them was getting him nowhere. Fortunately, he was able to shift to the open mode and notice that dairy maids never contracted smallpox. This led him to the hypothesis that they were somehow protected against the disease. In fact, most of them had contracted the harmless cowpox, which then conferred immunity from the deadly smallpox. Jenner’s success resulted from his capacity to try something different. He did not endlessly repeat an unsuccessful pattern. He interrupted it and tried a new and—as it turned out—successful approach. In our high-speed world, it is increasingly difficult to slow down and see things anew. Einstein himself said that he wasn’t necessarily smarter than other people; rather, he gave himself the chance to study a problem for a long time. In following his fascination, he went deeply into the problem and eventually saw it differently. This ability to slow down and follow our bliss, as Joseph Campbell used to say, is critical to creative thought. B.F. Skinner expresses it this way: “When you find something interesting, drop everything else and study it. Too many fail to answer opportunity’s knock at the door because they have to finish some preconceived plan” (quoted in Michalko, Cracking Creativity, Ten Speed Press 1998).

- Simple as it sounds, one key to higher creativity is slowing down. The consulting group that I mentioned earlier, Interaction Associates, has a slogan, “Go slow to go fast.” At first I thought it sounded a little corny, but I have seen it work repeatedly in the past few years. Perhaps one of the reasons that analyst earnings estimates are deteriorating, as noted in the last chapter, is precisely this issue of speed. As they race to cover stocks and grab banking deals, the quality of their thinking suffers. Slowing down is a matter of awareness. It’s knowing when you are in the closed, focused mode and when you are open and receptive. Many of the great discoveries in the history of thought are the result of this subtle difference. Penicillin, sticky notes, smallpox vaccine: all were accidents. They resulted from the researcher’s being open enough to a perceived failure to reframe it. (The classic case of this is Edison’s response that he had not failed to discover the appropriate filament for a light bulb; rather, he had successfully found a thousand filaments that did not work.) This notion that creativity is often accidental is the premise of a book called Corporate Creativity (Berrett-Koehler 1997) by Alan Robinson and Sam Stern.… ([Location 2884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2884))

Robinson and Stern suggest in their book that this open mode is a powerful tool for creative companies. You can’t make creativity happen, but you can train your people to be open to serendipity. Returning to our discussion of types, the most open types are “intuitives” and “perceivers.” They tend to live in the open mode. The most focused types are “sensors” and “judgers.” They would be the least likely to look at a “failed” experiment and say, “Hmmm, maybe this isn’t a failure after all. We just need to look at it differently.” A simple personal example may demonstrate the value of slowing down. Soon after I was linked to the Internet, I was asked to make a presentation to the business students at the Kellogg School of Management. As I was preparing the slides on the day of the presentation, I was hit by an inspiration: Why not include the Wildcat mascot on the slides?

- “R” is for risking discomfort. Innovators take chances. They push the envelope. They learn to accept the discomfort of creative tension. They’re sort of like the fellow whose doctor told him: “You’ve been under a lot of stress, you need to relax.” To which the man replied, “I tried relaxing, but—I don’t know—I feel more comfortable tense.” This paradox of being more comfortable while tense is where the creator lives. Unfortunately, many of the messages of our culture emphasize comfort as the goal of life. A variation on the bumper sticker, “The one with the most toys wins” might be “The one with the comfiest La-Z-Boy ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=2918))

If you look for comfort, you will not get either comfort or truth—only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and, in the end, despair [Mere Christianity, Macmillan 1952]. Workshop participants sometimes resist when I tell them that creativity involves pain. Just like exercise: When all is said and done, you need to put on your sneakers and do it. And, typically, if you’re not used to exercise, you’ll be sore afterward. What I try to offer clients is a fun, hard workout. Think of it this way: You can get good exercise playing a vigorous game of tennis or walking 18 holes of golf … or you could do jumping jacks for 30 minutes. All of these would raise your heart rate and burn off calories. Most people would agree, though, that a game is more enjoyable.

- “People would not be so awed by my creations if they knew how hard I worked to produce them.” Along these lines, John Cleese gives this advice: Set aside 90 minutes for creative thinking and then assume that the first 30 will be awkward and unpleasant. The trick is knowing that the first part will be tough and preparing for it. It’s easier to endure the discomfort if you anticipate it and know that it will ease after about 30 minutes. Too many otherwise creative people never make it through that first circle of fire. They quit after 10 minutes and miss all the good ideas that were waiting just around the next corner.

- Richard Pzena, from Sanford Bernstein, provides a good discussion of investors’ attitude toward risk. He addresses the problem of contrarian investing and how much courage it takes to really be out of favor in the market. Because being out of favor is so painful, he believes that the market operates efficiently by rewarding people for taking on that pain. In other words, if you buy the market “dogs,” the stocks that are cheap because everyone hates them, then you will be rewarded. The stocks will go up and you’ll outperform. However, there is usually a period of time—several quarters or more—where you will appear to be an idiot. Even the family dog will wonder if you have meatloaf for brains. As Pzena says of these contrarians, “Sometimes they will feel very lonely. Everyone, their clients, their peers, the press—will question their sanity.

- The technique discussed in this chapter involves a different approach. It involves the ability to hold the tension of the opposites, to accept that discomfort, and to wait until a third possibility emerges. This is the concept of the Hegelian dialectic: two opposing points of view that merge into a synthesis which produces a better solution than either point alone. Steven Covey, in his best-seller The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Simon & Schuster 1989), emphasizes this same point in the final habit, “Synergy.” Covey says, “Buddhism calls this the middle way. Middle in this sense does not mean compromise; it means higher, like the apex of the triangle.” The process of achieving this is very different from a debate, where one side wins. Rather, “they communicate back and forth until they come up with a solution they both feel good about. It’s better than the solutions either of them originally proposed.” Another powerful thinker, Ken Wilber, recognized by many as one of the brilliant minds of our time, expresses synergy this way: “Evolution always transcends and includes, incorporates and goes beyond.” Real progress does not claim that ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3119))

They took advance seat reservations, they tailored the type of plane to the route, they sold through travel agents, they flew to big airports, and they provided meals and movies. Airline executives believed that this formula was the only formula that could work—and that is the first clue to make you suspect that thinking has become too rigid, too fundamental, too fixed.

I sat taking notes and the analyst droned on about the Washington Post, Times Mirror, and finally Time Inc. I remember the meeting as being especially unremarkable until this analyst said, “Now that Time Inc. has divested itself of Temple Inland, the forest products division. …” My ears pricked up like the family dog when it sees the cat. My expression must have revealed my excitement because the next thing the analyst said was, “Oh crap! What day is it? Tuesday? Damn it! You can’t tell anybody I said that. I forgot that they aren’t announcing the divestiture until tomorrow.” Usually Wall Street analysts are pretty unflappable, but this guy looked like he had a live cigarette down his pants, so I knew some serious beans had been spilled.

- It’s no surprise then that analysts tend to live their lives like expert gamblers, keeping poker faces and hiding their cards. The problem with this approach—a theme that this book drives home with a hammer—is that it lacks balance. In the same way that we need to be shrewd about when to use our different traits, like sensing versus intuition, we need to know when to be open and when to be focused. Likewise, we need to know when to keep our own counsel and when to share information and enlist help. At the risk of being blunt, I’ll say that investment professionals wouldn’t recognize the power of collaboration if it bit them in the behind. This Lone Ranger approach (“I’ll do it myself, without help”) may be traced to the high value that investors place on being competent. Many investment professionals equate asking for help with being incompetent. Because they would rather endure third-degree burns than appear… ([Location 3259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3259))

He said that in all his years, only a couple of analysts ever stopped him to ask “if the emperor had any clothes.” The technique that I use to get around the “emperor’s clothes” phenomenon is something I call the Candid Camera technique. Remember Alan Funt on Candid Camera? A classic setup involved a person in a waiting room in which the pictures on the walls were moving slightly.

He placed a transparency on the overhead projector and began talking about the outlook for the company—according to the slide, eToys. A few minutes into his comments, I suspected that we were looking at the wrong slide. A few minutes after that, I knew we were looking at the wrong one. As predicted, the audience hunkered down and took notes harder. Although tempted to follow suit, I used the Candid Camera reframing technique instead. I asked myself how I would feel if this whole scene had been set up just to see I was the perfect lemming. Wouldn’t I feel stupid just going right over the cliff, no questions asked? Of course. So I stuck a hand up and pointed out the mistake. The speaker looked at his notes a few times, squinted at the screen, replaced “eToys” with “eBay,” thanked me, and went on.

Viewed from a different perspective, they were asking for and receiving help on difficult issues in a truly collaborative way. Am I saying that investment professionals should run out and share all their hard-earned information? No. There is a place for cooperation and a place for competition. Choice is the issue. Knowing when to use each and having a choice is the key. My experience with investors is that they spend so much time in the competitive mode that they miss many opportunities to ask for help. There is another arena in which investors could ask for help. As discussed in Chapter 5, investors could establish buddy systems to monitor their emotional reactions, the ones that could damage performance.

We could guard against these habits and avoid inferior decisions by buddying up with someone who knows us and our tendencies when emotional reactions are triggered.

- I believe that this principle of asking for help extends to the highest level. Call it prayer if you like, or simply a general request of the universe, but time after time, I have found that when I stop to put out a “formal” request for help, something magical occurs. Examples of this are given later in the book, but one that occurs to me now is a request that I made about money management and personality types. I wanted to find some fresh material that related money to personalities. I knew that somewhere, someone was thinking about these same issues—I just didn’t know where or who. So one evening, sitting in my office, I made my intention known by saying it aloud: “I’d like some help with my research. I want information about money management and personality types, information that would tie in to the book I’m writing.” (I get a kick out of our pets’ reactions to my monologues.

The book not only examined people’s relationship to money, based on four different temperaments (lions, foxes, owls, and dolphins), which was exactly my interest, but also viewed individuals and groups not as “static collections of traits but as dynamic systems of attributes-in-tension.” Bingo. Put simply, Doyle agrees with Csikszentmihalyi on the importance of complexity. Perhaps that’s not put so simply, after all; let me try it again. Complexity is the ability to balance opposing forces, like the ability to be decisive and to be flexible. Complexity seems to explain the extraordinary ability of our master investors.

- Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way. —Abraham Lincoln “T” is for tools and techniques. Improving creativity, whether individually or in groups, requires processes. People with the best intentions may meet to brainstorm and get minimal results. Why? Because they don’t have clear processes to guide them through the tough spots. One common mistake that’s already been mentioned is allowing the idea generators and the idea evaluators to work simultaneously. The result is usually that any new idea, especially if it’s radical, is dismissed immediately. Common reasons for dismissal are “It’s too expensive,” “It’s been tried,” and “It has never been tried.” The outcome of these meetings is usually a headache, because two conflicting forces were undermining any progress. To see the problem clearly, remember the last time you were in a traffic jam that was caused by a broken streetlight. Instead of traffic flowing neatly through the intersection, guided by the green and red lights, drivers had to inch their way into the intersection, one by one, taking forever and giving new meaning to the words “road rage.” The same is true of ideas. If the process is clearly defined, then participants understand the sequence. First ideas will be generated, without criticism, and then they will be evaluated. The process flows rather smoothly. The consulting firm that I mentioned earlier, Interaction Associates (IA), has been teaching organizations how to make meetings work for more than 20 years. In fact, the founders of IA, Michael Doyle and David Straus, literally wrote the book on it: How to Make Meetings Work (Dell 1976). IA’s research has shown that 90 percent of the problems with meetings are process-related rather than content-related. The example that IA uses to make this point is cooking an egg. The ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3354))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- egg is the content and the process could be one of many: boiling, scrambling, frying, and so on. To prove this point in the classroom, IA trainers will ask participants to name all the problems that make for bad meetings. Participants respond with a long list of items: no agenda, arriving late, losing focus, too long, sidebar discussions, no clear outcomes, no follow-through, and so forth. When the trainers then ask participants to state whether these problems involve processes or content, invariably the response is “process.” In other words, meeting participants usually agree on what to discuss (content), but they differ on how to discuss it. Hence, meetings go awry and live down to the reputation chronicled in Dilbert cartoons: horribly inefficient wastes of time. It’s a small wonder that Warren Buffett says the best meeting he attends each week is the one with himself in his mirror. Tools (processes) are important enablers of creativity. This may sound painfully obvious to readers, but my experience with investors is that they are very unsophisticated with regard to meeting technology. In fact, many investment meetings are the equivalent of eating with your ([Location 3370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3370))

I’ve been in investment meetings where the attendees weren’t even introduced to one another; there was no agenda; no use of visuals to help create common understanding; no clear roles (such as who is facilitating the meeting); long, boring downloads of information; and on and on. It’s no wonder that little is accomplished and that meetings have a bad reputation. Another rarity among investment professionals is planning for meetings. A rule of thumb for any meeting is an hour of planning for every hour of meeting time. Sound outrageous? Well, if you consider the expense of gathering 10 people in a room for 2 hours, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to have the meeting host take an hour to plan for it. After all, you wouldn’t invite 10 people over for dinner and then greet them at the door with, “Hey, glad you could make it, let’s look through the fridge and see what we’ve… ([Location 3380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3380))

- for example, are a good tool (see Chapter 10). Using Myers-Briggs preferences, you can design a process whereby meeting members agree to work with one filter at a time, thereby avoiding a mental traffic jam. The first filter, sensing, could be used to discuss the facts. No new ideas or evaluations, just the map of reality … what “is.” Then participants could agree to brainstorm and play with new ideas; this is the realm of intuition. You might even consider a separate meeting with the people who like brainstorming and are naturally inclined toward it. Finally, you could evaluate and refine ideas and test them in a practical sense. Thinking types are excellent in this role. Surrounding this whole process is the question of how much time should be spent playing with ideas and how much in moving on with the task at hand.

- A good general technique for starting any project is a brain dump. Here is the process. Collect the team members in a room and equip them with markers and pads of 3-by-5-inch sticky notes. One wall of the room should be covered with flipchart paper, unless the wall is naturally friendly to stickies. Spend a few minutes on introductions, if the team is new, and set the context for the brainstorming activity. Decide on the topic to be brainstormed. The wording makes a difference, of course. Each of the following might be related to increasing the stock price of your company, but they would be very different discussions: How can the company increase sales? How can the company reduce expenses? How can the company grow faster? How can the company earn a higher price/earnings multiple? When groups are first beginning a project, I suggest starting with as wide a topic as possible, because the process itself will define and structure future, more focused discussions. Start big and map out the entire territory. In fact, this idea came to me after watching a company called Learning Maps make a presentation at Disney World. Learning Maps is in the business of creating visual representations of a company’s position in the marketplace. They meet with company executives and work with them, in a creative fashion, to gain agreement about the nature of their business and how it would look as a board game. What is their goal? Who are the competitors? What industry conditions are changing? How does regulation affect them? What are the future threats? What are the key levers that determine sales growth? Developing and producing Learning Maps for a company is often time-consuming and expensive, but companies seem happy with the results… ([Location 3399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3399))

- now? Nearly impossible, right? There is a reason why the generals in those old war movies moved the plastic pieces around on the big map. They wanted everyone to be looking at the same view of reality. The map provides a rich tool for clarifications, discussions, disagreements, and strategies. The point here is that with a brain dump, teams can create a unified vision of their project in less than an hour. This process compares favorably with the countless hours taken up in traditional meetings, where a group sits around a conference table and talks endlessly. Also, the brain-dump process is simple. Propose a topic, check to make sure that participants understand and agree that it’s the “right” one, then turn the group loose for 10 minutes with their markers and stickies. Encourage them to put at least 10 ideas on the wall (one per minute). Ideally, each idea should have a noun and a verb.

- week” or “Balance family and work.” Also, instruct participants to write one or two ideas that are ridiculous. These ideas are great to loosen up the group and get them laughing. (Remember Harrison Owen’s advice: If it’s not fun, it’s not working!) And sometimes it’s the goofy ideas that lead to the breakthroughs. Here’s a brief digression on the importance of goofy ideas. A colleague at Interaction Associates tells of a brainstorming session in which the group was trying to raise money for a charity. All the usual fundraising ideas had been rounded up and then, as a joke, a man called out, “Rob a bank.” The group laughed. Silly idea. But then another participant remembered that his brother-in-law worked for a bank that was looking for a charitable cause to support. Eventually, this goofy idea led to the bank sponsoring the charity. (Remember the discussion of the inner critic in Chapter 15? How easy it would have been for this man to squash his own idea and not say, “Rob a bank.” Fortunately for the group, he took a chance and hollered it out.) When the group has “dumped” its ideas on the wall, take a moment to clarify them. Ask the ([Location 3428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3428))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- group if there are any ideas that need explanation. Also, check for duplicates. If two ideas are identical, there is no need to have them both on the wall. Checking for duplicates and clarifying shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. Sometimes the process derails here because the clarifying turns into advocating. Participants explain not only what their idea is but also why it is such a good one. The facilitator needs to jump in quickly and remind participants that there will be an opportunity later to advocate and prioritize the ideas. Right now, the task is to understand them. In our earlier Myers-Briggs language, this phase emphasizes sensing (the blue filter). Just the facts, ma’am—no interpretations. The next portion of the brain dump is to make some sense out of the ideas that have been thrown on the wall. Before suggesting a process for that, let me just explain the rationale for this first phase of silently filling out the notes and posting them. First, it invites the introverts to participate. Remember, introverts tend to prefer writing and internal dialogue to talking and processing out loud. Also, silence tends to help us move into the right hemisphere, where creativity lives. When we focus and talk, we move into the left hemisphere, where logic and verbal skills hang out. Finally, having the participants watch as the ideas go up on the wall allows them to build on one another’s thoughts, so synergy can take place. The notes on the wall are the key factors that the group has identified for the project, vision, strategy, or whatever they are brainstorming. The question now is, “How do these key factors relate to one another?” How does the group make sense of them? At this point I ask the group to shout out two ideas, from the stickies on the wall, that seem related. Example: The topic for the exercise is valuation of Internet stocks, and two ideas that were posted are “Price to Sales Ratio” and “Price to Earnings Ratio.” I would place these notes, which seem to be related, one above the other, in their own column. It’s best to stick them to the wall surface separately, rather than to each other. If too many notes are stuck onto each other, the entire column eventually falls off the wall.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To add creativity to this process, I tell the group that the columns they are now forming can have only four notes in each. This forces the group to make fine distinctions rather than lumping all the ideas under two big headings, like “Internet Stocks with Foreign Operations” and “Internet Stocks with Domestic Operations Only.” These sorts of general headings may be accurate, but they’re not particularly useful. An important point (which harks back to our earlier discussion of top-down versus bottom-up investors from Chapter10) is this: Participants invariably try to name the general categories before they have really done the pairings of ideas. Someone will look at the mass of notes and start dictating categories: We need one for “P/E ratios,” one for “Price to Sales ratios,” and so on. I suggest that you enforce the instruction of simply pairing up related ideas. In other words, stay at the level of details and don’t jump to the… ([Location 3457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3457))

- teams. It’s neat to watch. Without any explicit leadership or micromanagement, this task of organizing the data occurs quickly and effectively. The right people step up and get it done. It’s like watching Adam Smith’s invisible hand at work. The facilitator shouldn’t interfere too much. If someone wants to move notes that have already been placed, that’s fine. Others have the option of moving them back again! When the sorting and organizing are finished, pass out some stickies that are a different color from the originals and preferably larger (4-by-6-inchers work well). Ask the participants to pair up in threes (as Yogi Berra used to say) and ask these small groups to name columns that they want to work with. Here is the part of the exercise that intuitives will like. It involves finding a pattern. Have them look at the ideas in their assigned column and identify the relationship between them.

The final phase of a brain dump is to ask the participants to consider the relationship among the headers. In this way, the group is beginning to create its own learning map. The group members are looking at their collective “reality”—the key factors involved in the topic—and discussing what the map should look like. I give them stickies with arrows drawn on them and ask the group once again to go to the wall and arrange the headers in some logical order. It could be chronological, cause and effect, prioritized… whatever is appropriate. This exercise is not done in silence. It is important to discuss and reach agreements in this phase, so talking is encouraged. Usually this final phase takes about 15 minutes to complete.

Sometimes the brain dump provides the solution and nothing more is needed. I facilitated such a session with a group of train-ing professionals at a Fortune 500 company. Each of the five peo-ple thought that they were in for a long afternoon of political intrigue, negotiating, bargaining, and positioning. Their task was to design and agree on a core curriculum for training the em- ployees and leaders of the company. In their minds, I would be facilitating a meeting with debates, conflict, and possibly even breakdowns. The result was quite the opposite. I suggested the brain dump exercise as a way to start.

First, additional research with employees and leaders must be conducted, then courses have to be designed to deliver the desired outcomes, measurement systems have to be in place to monitor the progress and success, and a feedback loop has to be established so that employees and leaders can participate in continuous improvement. This solution may seem unremarkable or fairly obvious to the reader, but it came as a tremendous relief to the five professionals involved. They didn’t end up in a war with one another. They didn’t even end up in a skirmish. Instead, they were motivated to divide up the work and focus their energy on the real task ahead: marketing this proposal to the senior leaders.

A latecomer to the discussion interjected that this issue was, in fact, the critical distinction between physics and investing: Because physics is a natural science, there are answers (though scientists may never uncover them). In contrast, investing is not an exact science, and therefore it does not have “final” answers. In vesting is an art, not a science, as the ([Location 3755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3755))

- saying goes. At that moment, Phil Fortuna, director of quantitative research at Scudder, Stevens & Clark and a former physics major, chimed in with a lucid explanation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. (This was very lucky for me, as I was dangerously close to trying to explain it myself.) This principle states that when observing a subatomic particle, one may choose to measureamong other quantitiesthe particle’s position and its momentum (a quantity defined as the particle’s mass times its velocity). [But] these two quantities can never be measured simultaneously with precision. We can either obtain a precise knowledge about the particle’s position and remain completely ignorant about the particle’s momentum (and thus about its velocity), or vice versa; or we can have a rough and imprecise knowledge about both quantities. The important point now is that this limitation has nothing to do with the imperfection of our measuring techniques. It is a principle limitation which is inherent in the atomic reality [Capra, The Tao of Physics]. The last two sentences seem to address exactly the anguished quantifier’s concern about his ([Location 3759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3759))

- shortcomings in math. As in physics, the reality of investing may be that there is no Golden Rule that applies to all situations, no matter how clever we are. Another problem in both disciplines is the difficulty of measuring effectin other words, isolating what causes what. In the relativistic world of modern physics and investing, things get a bit amorphous. Consider this description of the behavior of the electron by physicist Robert Oppenheimer: If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say “no”; if we ask whether the electron’s position changes with time, we must say “no”; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say “no”; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say “no” [Oppenheimer, Science and the Common Understanding, Simon & Schuster 1954]. This paradox is a little like saying that a certain person is not… ([Location 3769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3769))

- The same problem can be seen in investments when trying to attribute performance to various factor bets in a portfolio: If we ask whether the excess return was due to a small-cap exposure, we can say “yes”; if we ask whether it was due to a low P/E exposure, we can say “yes”; if we ask whether it was due to a low beta, we can say “yes”; if we ask whether it was due to a high yield, we can say “yes”; and so on. The more one focuses on a single factor, the harder it is to disentangle the effects of the others. When new factors are found that account for excess returns, they further complicate the picture, much like when physicists find new elementary particles. Some of you may be thinking, “Oh brother, this is snooze-ville, all this technical talk about physics.” Well, did you ever consider what it’s like for me at holidays? No, I thought not.

- Vaga calls his work an example of theory catching up with practice. One of our master investors, Marty Zweig, has established a good performance record in the face of overwhelming “evidence” from academicians that his technical analysis doesn’t work. The coherent market hypothesis recognizes this fact and is broad enough to include the possibility of success from either fundamental or technical analysis, depending on the state of the market (i.e., groupthink or rational). In this sense, it also helps to resolve the investing paradox of whether one should double up on stocks that have fallen dramatically (“if you liked it at $40, you’ll love it at $20!”) or sell ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3825))

- them (“cheap stocks get cheaper … wait until it’s formed a bottom”). The resolution involves a correct reading of investor sentiment: If investor behavior is still characterized by groupthink, then yes, you should sell; if the sentiment reading indicates a rational state, however, then it’s safe to double up. The point here is not that it’s always easy to determine what the sentiment reading is, but rather that either view can be appropriate, depending on investor psychology. This broader framework may help to defuse the usual catfights that ensue when “buy-cheap” fundamentalists square off with “sell-rule” technicians. The coherent market hypothesis, with its elegant mathematics and quantitative foundation, stops short of a detailed explanation of the psychology underlying investor behavior. Vaga refers to the “Theory of Social Imitation” as the theoretical underpinning of investor groupthink. This theory examines similar behavior in nature (such as fish moving in schools or birds flying in formation) and draws comparisons between these events and societal phenomena such as fashion fads.

- The power of intuitive understanding will protect you from harm until the end of your days. —Lao Tsu The notion of telepathy and investor groupthink brought to my mind the phenomenon of the hundredth monkey. The WHAT? The “hundredth monkey” is a shorthand name for an observed, documented event that occurred on the island of Koshima in the 1950s. Researchers on the island had dumped sweet potatoes on the beach. The monkeys they were studying there had never encountered sweet potatoes before. Although they liked the taste, the monkeys did not like the sandy coating that resulted from the potatoes lying on the beach. Eventually, one monkey genius discovered that she could ([Location 3859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3859))

- clean the potatoes by washing them in the sea. Other monkeys gradually learned or copied the process until, finally, roughly 100 monkeys were washing their potatoes. Then, quite suddenly, the entire troop caught on, as if some critical mass had been reached. But more amazingly, researchers on other islands reported that this threshold level must have triggered the learning response in their monkeys as well, because the monkeys on those islands began using the washing technique at exactly the same time. To explain this bizarre event, Rupert Sheldrake, a biochemist, has postulated a morphonogenetic field (M-field), which al- lows conveyance of information within like species (Sheldrake, A New Science of Life, Inner Traditions International 1995). Experiments with rats conducted by William McDougall, recreating the hundredth-monkey phenomenon, suggest that when… ([Location 3866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3866))

- Dr. Larry Dossey’s studies, performed with patients in hospitals, document other instances in which minds appear to have “teamed up” and become coherent (Peace, Love and Healing: Bodymind Communication and the Path to Self-Healing, Harper & Row 1989). Groups of people were asked to pray for certain patients, while a control group of patients had no such support. The studies indicated that the “prayer” patients recovered more rapidly. Again, there seems to be a threshold level, as with the monkeys, beyond which there is enough critical mass to help heal illness. So, I began wondering if there is an M-field that affects investors. Are we influenced, perhaps unknowingly, to buy or sell securities because of the mindsets of investors around us? When technicians state that market sentiment is very positive, is that sentiment feeding on itself and creating a powerful M-field that convinces still more investors to buy? Is an M-field the real… ([Location 3876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3876))

The article states that “Maharishi International University researchers say that they can show that previous waves of ‘super radiance’ from mass meditation have boosted the stock market.” The writer of the article, knowing that WSJ readers are a hard-boiled bunch, goes to great lengths to show that the researchers at MIU adhered strictly to the rules of scientific method. The article quotes Bruce Russet, editor of a respected scientific quarterly: “I decided that these people had played the scientific game correctly.” The MIU researchers had used sophisticated and legitimate methods for confirming their hypothesis that when a critical mass of “super radiance” is created, it can affect nonmeditators and even the stock market.

- Imagine the possibility of portfolio managers picking 10-baggers by using intuition alone. (And think of the reduction in overhead expenses; Ouija boards are much cheaper than computers and IT consultants.) Should we listen to our intuition as investors?

- now developing systems to replicate intuition. They are called Artificial Neural Systems (ANS) and, in an unstructured decision environment like investing, offer distinct advantages over expert systems, which simulate deductive reasoning (i.e., logic). For example, an article by D. D. Hawley in the Financial Analysts Journal reported that “if an ANS could be trained to simulate the experience-based intuition of a successful technician, it could result in a substantial increase in the number of stocks that could be analyzed in real time” (“Artificial Neural Systems: A New Tool for Financial Decision Making,” Nov./Dec. 1990). Although simulating inductive reasoning with computers is a long way from making psychic predictions, there is a growing interest in nondeductive decision making.

- I believe intuition is the sum total of all the stimuli that traders receive in an instant or over time and also the sum total of all their experience in the market. —Howard Abell, The Inner Game of Trading (Irwin 1993) In business, only intuition can protect you against the most dangerous individual of allthe articulate incompetent. —Robert Bernstein, Chairman, Random House Is intuition useful? I believe that using intuition as an equal partner with logic is the single greatest strategy that money managers can employ. There, I said it. Like the Christians who were thrown to the four-legged lions, I have thrown myself before the two-legged lions who rule the major investment firms and run the markets. I can almost hear, from my office window, the sound of books slamming closed as lion investors read these sentences and exclaim, “Crackpot!”; Okay. I understand why lions would react that way. Lions rely heavily on the information that they receive from their five senses. They trust the “real” world, that which we can see and hear. They trust measurable results. They trust their experience. They trust things that they can understand. Herein lies the problem. Intuition, by definition, is the knowing of something directly, without understanding why.

- Here’s the interesting part, though. That crazy statement about intellect and intuition, the one that we would probably dismiss as nonsense, is a direct quote from Albert Einstein, arguably the best thinker of the 20th century. The point is obvious. In financial circles the intellect rules. That is our belief system. Wall Street is full of brilliant analysts, making huge sums of money, who have never demonstrated any ability to perform. Yes, they are marvelous debaters. Yes, they weave convincing arguments on any given scenario. But when we look behind their intellectual curtain, we see a little man with no magical powers of prediction. Isn’t it ironic that an industry that is so obsessed with the bottom line produces so many “stars” who don’t give results? Consider the same scenario in a different industry, say, automobiles.

- Imagine a really smart car salesman (I hear those snickers) who gave you brilliant explanations of all the working parts of the engine and braking systems. He wowed you with his knowledge of cars. The problem, though, is that the cars he sold didn’t work. Would you buy another from him? Fat chance. The product doesn’t work! End of story. Not so in the investment industry. Interestingly, the “product” basically doesn’t work. Very few firms outperform passive strategies. (Even Peter Lynch, one of our masters, who is pictured in print ads and seen on TV, might not have been able to maintain his superior record during the 1990s.) Despite the failings of the product, which is reflected in the rapid growth of index funds, there is tremendous resistance to experimenting with different approaches. In fact, in 20 years of professional investing, I’ve never heard a colleague suggest that we should rely more on intuition. It would be heresy. One might as well report regular Elvis sightings—they would be taken more seriously. ([Location 3992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=3992))

- Every one of the traders in the book agrees that the highest degree of expertise occurs when a person’s experience and knowledge allows him to move beyond intellect into the realm of intuition. In the words of Bill Williams—a trader of 35 years and author of the book Trading Chaos: Applying Expert Techniques to Maximize Profits (John Wiley & Sons 1995): “At the fifth level, which is what I call the expert level, trading is almost all right hemisphere. It’s all intuitive. … At this level you know what is the right trade without knowing how you know.”; ([Location 4004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JZWC9Q&location=4004))

- The paradox is that good intuition relies on lots of left-brained, intellectual experience and hard work. Edward Toppel, long-term member of the Index and Options Market and author of Zen in the Markets (Warner 1994), writes, “Intuition allows you to take advantage of all that hard work you’ve done.”; Actually, this “paradox” is consistent with the message of this book: balance. A superior investor will use the skills of both the right and left brain hemispheres. The mistake that many investors make, however, is relying solely on their favorite hemisphere, the logical left side. The purpose in citing all these examples of successful intuitive traders is to encourage lion investors to experiment with using intuition, so that they will begin using all the weapons available.

- the successful interplay between logic and intuition. Soros, with his penchant for reversing huge positions on a moment’s notice, clearly relies heavily on his intuition. But even Buffett—the exemplary long-term investor (“My preferred investment horizon is forever”)—uses intuition in his investing. He is well known for doing major business transactions only with people whom he trusts. In this sense, Buffett relies heavily on his intuitive ability to size up the character of business partners. Facts and logic (left-brain items) could help Buffett eliminate certain potential partners (the ones with shady records), but they could never confirm that someone would be trustworthy in the future. A leap of faith, based on intuition, is required for that. Intuition also allows today’s portfolio managers to operate more quickly, without assembling all the available information. Legendary investor Charles Merrill (of Merrill Lynch fame) commented on this phenomenon. He said that “if he made decisions fastintuitively?—he was right 60 percent of the time.

- For my part, I will continue to watch with great interest as the dialectic between the right and left brain—intellect and intuition—plays itself out in the investment arena.

- I can imagine a day when the top investment firms understand that intellect and intuition should be in equal partnership. Left and right will be balanced. Lion Kings and Royal Wizards will team up to provide an unbeatable force. In the meantime, if this book has given you any ideas, and you try out some of the exercises, and stretch even just a little bit, you may find a whole new dimension of the investing game opening up to you. I wish you great success as you perfect the equal partnership of left- and right-brain skills. But if you get filthy rich as the result of pure luck, hey, that’s nice too!
