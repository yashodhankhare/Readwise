- Category: #books

## Highlights
- Do you watch TV, read magazines, connect with friends on Facebook, or surf the Web? Do you frequent the mall, eat out, or shop for groceries? Do you have children in your family or extended family? Do you spend your daytime hours anywhere other than a Wall Street trading room? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you have what it takes to become a successful self-directed investor. You might very well be an outsider to Wall Street and “all things financial,” but unlike the Wall Street suits who spend their days staring at flashing ticker symbols on computer screens, you have your feet deeply planted in the real world. Because of that, you have firsthand exposure to the companies, products, and trends that shape winning investments in both good times and bad.

- This book will teach you how to view your world through “investor’s glasses.” I will not use financial or technical jargon you don’t understand, or ask you to break out your financial calculator, either. What I will do is improve your financial well-being by showing you how to take advantage of the innate observational and investigative skills you already have. You will learn from the experiences and real-world stories of successful amateur investors from varied professional backgrounds and age groups.

- My father, a lawyer, had limited investing experience, but he was wise enough not to take my money. Instead, he taught me an important lesson in stock investing I would never forget. He explained that the price of Toys“R”Us stock already reflected all widely known information about the company including past, present, and anticipated future sales. I learned that the price of the company’s stock, much like the stock price of other companies that benefit from holiday sales, does not go up in value each holiday season—as investors already anticipate that the company will sell more toys at that time of year. A decade later I would relearn this lesson while studying the “efficient markets theory” in business school. The theory asserts that it is not possible for a person to achieve investment returns greater than average market returns, given the information publicly available at the time of the investment. “But then how do you know,” I asked my father, “when to buy a company’s stock?” “That depends,” he replied. “The very best time to buy a company’s stock is when you think you know something about that company that others don’t. Otherwise, picking stocks at random gives you as good a chance of picking winners as any stock-picking strategy. Never let anyone tell you different.” ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=129))

- My dad had explicitly warned me not to let “beginner’s luck” go to my head. “Lightning,” he said, “rarely strikes twice in the same spot.” But not surprisingly, being an almost-teenage know-it-all, I wasn’t listening to what I didn’t want to hear. What did he know, anyway? My dad was a lot of things, but a risk taker was not one of them. Neither he nor my mom believed in shortcuts.

It was this insight into Wall Street’s investing behavior that would eventually empower me to crack the black box of investing success for myself.

- I found that experimenting with technical analysis is kind of like ordering calf fries (translation for non-Texans: cow testicles) at a restaurant. You know it’s a bad idea, but you do it anyway to learn firsthand what you are not missing. The legendary self-made billionaire and investor Warren Buffett has said, “I realized technical analysis didn’t work when I turned the charts upside down and didn’t get a different answer.” He also noted, “If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.” Still, the lure of making money simply by observing past peaks and valleys on stock charts is seductive for any potential investor looking to turn a quick profit with minimal effort. Unfortunately, in the case of technical analysis, what seems too good to be true is all ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=210))

- The problem is that stocks, much like the people who buy and sell them, are not as predictable as they appear to be. And when money is at stake, the behavior of crowds trying to profit from the perceived ebb and flow of stock price fluctuations quickly tends to neutralize any price patterns that do exist.

- Of course, the latest movement in technical analysis leverages computer-assisted techniques to apply complex algorithms in the simulation and decoding of artificial neural networks, completely removing the need for human interpretation of charts. Is your head spinning yet? If Wall Street is great at one thing, it is their ability to repackage, in ways that are indecipherably new and complex, investment strategies proven to be ineffective, to “sell” prospective clients. If we have learned anything from the financial debacle of 2008 it is “garbage in, garbage out.” Indeed, now anyone with $299 and a computer can purchase technical charting software off an infomercial that will tell them exactly when to buy and sell nearly any stock in the world.

- An investor using fundamental analysis to purchase stock believes that he will sell the stock at a higher price once the market recognizes its “mistake” and is willing to pay the stock’s “true” value. But if every Wall Street analyst and investor values companies differently based on the financial, growth, and risk assumptions they feel are of the highest importance to them, what does one need in order to trust that the market at large will ever allow the company’s stock price to catch up to its hypothetical “true” value? The answer is patience. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=316))

- Just look at the second richest person in the world, investor Warren Buffet, who has said, “If a business does well, the stock eventually follows.” But Buffet isn’t concerned with how long it takes for the market eventually to recognize the worth of a company he invests in; he is supremely patient and knows that over time a company’s profits will demand the respect of the market. If you think you possess half the patience and financial wit as Warren Buffet, and have the appetite to spend endless hours crunching numbers, contrasting mathematic ratios, and analyzing corporate risk factors, you might try your hand at fundamental analysis. Just know you will be competing with thousands of brilliant MBA-trained business minds. And beware, on the off chance you are able to stand out from the crowd, your time frame for success ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=329))

- will more likely be measured in decades than in months or years. If you do have the financial proficiency and temperament to play with the big boys on Wall Street, you might as well work with them and get paid regardless of whether your analysis is correct. Fundamental analysis is a grinding game of inches, and for most of us it is no fun to play. Here’s an important third point: COMBINING TWO LOSING STRATEGIES DOES NOT RESULT IN A WINNING STRATEGY ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=335))

- It is not investment analysis, but the art of uncovering game-changing information before others do that is the true Holy Grail of investing. So if painstaking technical and fundamental analysis have both been exposed as marginally effective at best, why wouldn’t every professional on Wall Street be scouring the planet simply to be the first to get ahold of game-changing, stock-moving information? The answer is simple. Time-honored Wall Street institutions exist and are paid to decipher complex problems they are uniquely qualified to “solve.” They make money from selling these professional services, regardless of whether the services make you money. However, the multibillion-dollar Wall Street institutions full of gifted MIT engineers and Harvard-trained financial analysts are ill-equipped to uncover the next fad in video gaming, food, or fashion. Perhaps one day Wall Street will wake up and begin hiring and training behavioral investigators to crack tomorrow’s trends, but until then, you can be sure they will busy themselves generating profits by selling what they do best: crunching numbers and analyzing charts. In a financial industry that is richly rewarded for mediocrity, there is simply not enough financial incentive for them to leave their comfort zone. And that is great news for us Wall Street outsiders. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=357))

- Ironically, it was not trend regression or portable alpha analysis or any other complex-sounding Wall Street toy, but my father’s unsophisticated advice, “buy when you know something that others don’t,” that would go on to lay the groundwork for my greatest stock picks and would define my future success as an investor—thus proving that sometimes the simplest answers are indeed the truest.

- There are two jobs most of us would drool to have: Wall Street analyst and Los Angeles or Las Vegas TV weatherman (“… and tomorrow, another sunny day!”). These are two jobs in which you can be utterly useless, yet be paid handsomely, so long as you look and sound good.2 William Goldman, the American novelist, playwright, and two-time Academy Award–winning screenwriter, wrote, “The single most important fact, perhaps, of the entire movie industry: Nobody knows anything.… Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what’s going to work. Every time out it’s a guess—and, if you’re lucky, an educated one.”3 I can’t say for sure whether those words speak absolute truth in Hollywood, but they couldn’t be a more accurate depiction of Wall Street, where the story of Jack Grubman is far from an anomaly.

- Spend more than five minutes listening to Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman, Jean Chatzky, or any of the other practical money advice authorities, and chances are you will hear them preaching the value of the 401(k) as one of the best places to put your money—that is, of course, after you’ve paid down all your credit card debt. For most people, most of the time, this advice is absolutely correct—which, ironically, is unfortunate for all of us.

- Like most mid- to large-size American companies, my former employer offered a company-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan, to which I had made monthly contributions for nine years. Each month, my company matched a percentage of what I contributed to the plan—a feature unique to company-sponsored 401(k) plans. Unlike the investments that sit outside my retirement account, my 401(k) plan allows me to invest pre-tax dollars, while delaying for decades payment of all taxes—even those on stock gains I amass over time—until I begin to withdraw money from the 401(k), ideally during my retirement years, when I’m at a lower income tax bracket. The combined benefits of company matching and tax deferrals make the 401(k) a winning investment vehicle—with one colossal exception. As is commonplace with nearly all company-sponsored retirement plans, investment ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=507))

- options for employees contributing money to their 401(k) are more often than not confined to a handful of fee-based mutual funds chosen by an investment firm contracted by the company to be the 401(k) plan’s adviser. The investment firm that successfully sells its way into your employer’s human resources or finance department to become the company’s 401(k) plan adviser enjoys a captive audience of clients, including you and all of your coworkers. This ability to handcuff an entire organization and its employees makes the 401(k) one of the most financially lucrative investment vehicles for a financial institution involved in fee-based investment management. The plan at my company allowed us to choose from among nine mutual fund options. Each was marketed as a “no load” fund, meaning it charged zero upfront commission—when in actuality it extracted recurring annual expense fees, known as “soft fees,” of 1 to 3 percent. Over a thirty-year period, a recurring annual expense fee of just 2 percent can reduce the value of your… ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=513))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Unlike “hard” upfront commissions, “soft” expense fees are not billed to the investor but instead are deducted annually from the fund’s combined pool of investment money. A $100 million fund with a “soft” 2 percent expense fee that generates an 8 percent annual investment return will simply deduct its $2 million in fees from its $8 million in investment gains, reporting to you a return of only 6 percent on your investment, not the 8 percent the fund’s portfolio of investments actually made. Likewise, if the fund loses 8 percent, it will tack on its $2 million in fees to its $8 million investment loss. Say you invested $10,000 in the fund. Your statement will simply show a 10 percent, or $1,000, annual loss, when in actuality 25 percent, or $250, of that $1,000 loss is due to the fund’s expense fees. The problem with “soft” expense fees is that they are not separated out for you on your account statements. Unless you do your own math, you have no way of knowing how much you are actually paying. Nearly all of the expertly managed funds comprising my retirement portfolio underperformed the stock market over the nine years I made 401(k) contributions. For this underperformance, I had the privilege of paying nearly $20,000 in fund management fees, a calculation I was left to do on my own. Ironically, this $20,000 in fees happened to be nearly the same amount of money that my employer contributed to my 401(k) plan in matching funds over the years. Over time, the compounding effect of mutual fund fees can neutralize much if not all of the benefits of even the best-intentioned corporate 401(k) programs. Even so, the 401(k) is more popular today than it ever has been. Roughly fifty million working Americans have 401(k)–style plans. The median 401(k) account balance is now about $23,000. By applying an industry median 1 percent annual fund expense fee, we are able to estimate fees generated solely from company-sponsored 401(k) plan contributions to be $11.5 billion (i.e., 50,000,000 × $23,000 × 1 percent). Even more astonishing is the negative impact on our retirement account that the $11.5 billion in fees buys us investors. By returning roughly 2 percent less per year to shareholders than the stock market returns, the professional money managers cost our retirement accounts $23 billion every year (i.e., 50,000,000 × $23,000 × 2 percent)… ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=523))

The experiment was one of many conducted over the past several decades, all of which show that when offered an even-odds gamble between winning a relatively large amount of money and losing a relatively small amount of money, most people will refuse the bet. Only when the size of the reward is more than twice the size of the potential loss do people decide that the risk is worth taking. This is because people fear losing money, often to the point of irrationality. The more money at stake, the more likely we are to exhibit extreme risk-averse behavior.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “I dip my pen in the blackest ink, because I’m not afraid of falling into my inkpot.” Emerson, perhaps one of the boldest and most outspoken of the great American philosophers and essayists, was not afraid to take chances with his words. Likewise, those who have prospered most on Wall Street have all shared one important trait, enabling them to take unprecedented chances with money. Be it the financial robber barons of the early twentieth century or the loathed modern-day derivative traders dealing in mortgage-backed securities, those who have amassed the largest fortunes on Wall Street have all done so by leveraging other people’s money—money belonging to their clients and investors, people like you and me. Doing so enabled them to take bold risks at our expense on high-stakes investments with big potential payoffs, in which ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=628))

It became clear to me early in life that to achieve my financial goals in a timely fashion, I, too, would have to find the courage and resources to bet and bet big on my own investing ideas. So I created my own investing “inkpot” of sorts—a virtual subaccount within my investing accounts, where I could fearlessly invest with conviction, funded exclusively with money I wasn’t afraid to lose, money I never intended to have in the first place, money I could leverage and reinvest many times over to turn hundreds of dollars into thousands, and thousands into millions. I refer to this as my Big Money account. And emulating those on Wall Street, I label all of the money used to fund my Big Money investments OPM, short for Other People’s Money. Yet unlike on Wall Street, the OPM funds that comprise my Big Money account do not belong to anyone other than me.

This seemingly far-fetched goal is surprisingly achievable with as little as one winning investment every one to two years. The trick is learning how to pick that one winning investment and understanding how to apply some very simple tools of financial leverage. (We’ll talk about these later.) First, we need to find the money to invest. Even when money is tight, it is possible. The trick to “finding” money in your budget is to evaluate cash not at its current worth, but at its potential worth as a Big Money investor.

- Serendipity, the gift of making useful discoveries by accident, is the modern-day term most often used to define the circumstances surrounding such “chance” scientific discoveries and those fortunate enough to have made them. But what may appear to have been an accidental discovery is most often the result of a methodical process instilled within the scientific mind-set. In the book Scientific Social Surveys and Research, sociology scholar Pauline V. Young suggests that “Scientists cultivate serendipity by being constantly alert for chance occurrences that may lead to new explanations or discoveries.”11 The “chance” observation leading to the unexpected result would be rendered useless ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=838))

It is the ability to spot game-changing information that has the potential to determine your fate in achieving financial prosperity as an investor.

This phenomenon is more prevalent in the field of investment management than perhaps in any other industry, as investment professionals nearly always conduct their analysis using narrowly defined financial and statistical models that are exclusively reliant on information acquired through established channels. They place little to no emphasis on “off-the-radar” unpublished information not yet widely accepted as fact by other professionals or the investing public.

- The heart of this book’s investment methodology lies in the assumed existence of information imbalances across two distinct information markets: Wall Street and Main Street. The previously cited story about a popular video game maker is an example of an information imbalance where we have the business itself telling a story of growth and success while the blogs and chat rooms of congregating gamers convey a very different story—one of a stagnant company product line. The information imbalance phenomenon is defined by the window of time between the earliest emergence of information on Main Street and the point at which that information reaches information parity on Wall Street.

- I call the science of initiating investments upon discovery of an information imbalance, and exiting investments at the point of information parity, “information arbitrage.” As an early bird shopping tag sales, I focused my information arbitrage efforts on male-oriented products, which were often mispriced by the women managing the sales. But on Wall Street, the high concentration of middle-aged men who influence investment decisions creates opportunities to profit from information imbalances that are most pronounced with respect to female- and youth-oriented products, companies, and trends. A small tweak and reapplication of my tag sale strategy was all it took for me to transition the skills I’d accrued as an early bird to become one of the world’s most successful self-directed investors.

- Critical observation is the all-important element of a rigid process known as the scientific method. This concept, employed by all scientists, is simple: an observation is made, a hypothesis is proposed, experiments are done, and conclusions are reached.

Many of the most financially lucrative information arbitrage investment opportunities are created out of biases that exist on Wall Street. If you share in Wall Street’s preconceptions, or lack the vision to see around them, your ability to notice the information imbalance will be negated. The trick is to become less self-observant and more observant of those around you. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1195))

You should now know how to do that. The second step is to verify that Wall Street is unaware of or ill informed about your game-changing discovery. For this final step, your chances for success are greatest when you focus on opportunities that Wall Street is most likely to miss.

- The more there is to gain or lose, the more likely the “professionals” are to get it right. This suggests that the lion’s share of investment opportunities to discover information imbalances lies with smaller, little-known companies. Supporting this theory are the previously cited comparisons between professionally managed mutual funds and unmanaged index funds. These comparisons clearly show that the greatest margin of professional underperformance coincides with professionally managed funds targeting small companies.

- So, all else being equal, you can assume that the discovery of game-changing information involving small companies is more likely to coincide with an information imbalance than the discovery of game-changing information involving large companies. This makes the story of one of my most successful and longest running information arbitrage investments so intriguing, as it involves the stock of a company that is, by anyone’s measure, one of the world’s largest and most well known, generating annual revenue in excess of $50 billion. The company’s business is regularly dissected by both the Wall Street press corps and teams of senior analysts at more than forty of Wall Street’s largest and most prestigious investment firms. Many consider the company to be the most widely covered and overanalyzed on Wall Street. Yet fiscal quarter after fiscal quarter, for years on end, the innate biases of those on Wall Street have caused the professionals to grossly underestimate consumer interest in this company’s products—resulting in one colossal information imbalance after another. Chances are that you’re familiar, if not intimately acquainted, with the products made by the company I’m referring to. Its name is Apple. All my life, I have been a “PC guy.” Beginning in high school and throughout every corporate job I’ve ever held, my only exposure to computing has been working on PCs. And like a lot of people, I tend to resist unnecessary change, ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1413))

- especially if that change requires me to learn new things. Combine that with Apple’s premium price points for Mac computers—and the fear that change will not improve my livelihood but will, instead, cause me to have to learn a new way of doing things—and you start to understand my reluctance to change my PC ways. For many years this was the norm in my world. Other than the sole Web site designer at my former company, to my knowledge not a single person in my family, social, or business network owned a Mac. The first person I knew of to “go Mac” was a longtime friend by the name of Len Critcher. Len, being a semiprofessional videographer, purchased his Mac specifically for its unique video editing capabilities, which seemed to make sense. But then something weird started to happen. He started to talk about his Mac a lot, in a really annoying way, and not in a way I had ever heard anyone talk about his computer. He had become obsessed with how great his Mac was for every imaginable use. But he also began to ask an irritating question: “How do you antiquated barbarians possibly get through the day using a PC?” Okay, he wasn’t that blunt, but it wasn’t as if he hadn’t been getting by on a PC just fine his entire life up to that point. Over time this peculiar behavior escalated to a point where he could no longer sit through a friendly lunch or dinner without instigating an unwelcome Mac vs. PC debate. Before long, several in our circle raised the red flag of ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1424))

- defeat, trading in their PCs for Macs—and were rewarded by no longer having to bear the brunt of Len’s “You’re missing out on life because you don’t use a Mac” lectures. Soon after, I watched as, like a row of tipping dominos, each and every one of my friends made the switch from a PC to a Mac. Len was first, then Dave, Jerry, Jason, Drew, Jordan, Brett, Blaine, Merritt, and, yes, eventually even I reluctantly bought a MacBook to use as our family computer at home. Even then, though, I resisted using the Mac, sticking to my company-issued laptop PC (which I held onto through three batteries, two keyboard replacements, and a near-fatal hard drive crash requiring multiple days of data reconstruction by my company’s IT team). As I said, I can be really stubborn when it comes to instituting change in my life. That was, until the day I saw the light of Apple for myself. That day, we were launching a youth-focused research panel at my company in which we needed to determine which brands of gift cards to offer as program rewards. We were seeking incentives that were most likely to entice teens and young adults to participate in market research surveys. As part of our research efforts, I moderated a focus group comprised of young consumers age fourteen through twenty-five. I solicited feedback on gift card reward options spanning a multitude of categories, ranging from youth apparel stores to fast-food dining certificates. Opinions were fairly mixed, until I floated the idea of Apple gift cards. This suggestion invoked an emotional response unlike any other I had witnessed from a focus group—before or since. The tired young faces in the room lit up in exhilaration at the mere idea of being able to earn gift cards toward Apple products. Those who did not own a Mac computer wanted one, and those who already had a Mac either desired a newer model or had an interest in other Apple devices, accessories, or music downloads through the company’s iTunes store. The high price of Apple products did not seem to deter their longing to own the brand’s products. It wasn’t designer clothing or fancy cars they craved, but “Apple this, Apple that.” If consumer electronics had become the new fashion, Apple was Chanel, Prada, and Versace combined. These young people’s loyalty to the Apple brand went uncontested. There was no runner-up, no “nearly as good” second-choice brand of… ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1435))

- They were their 24/7 portholes to laughter, tears, friendship, and love—a place to reveal and broadcast their inner selves to the world. Computers and computer-like devices had become this new generation’s window to life. To them, the computer had become much more of a pleasure-oriented than a work-oriented device. Only by recognizing the emotional imprint of such “computing-centric” experiences can one understand why a teenager earning minimum wage would enthusiastically save up hundreds of dollars and make lifestyle trade-offs in order to be able to afford what she perceived to be a superior, though premium-priced, computer from Apple. Now I was eager to experience the Apple hype firsthand. I went home that evening and, in the days that followed, forced myself to use our family MacBook instead of my laptop PC. I quickly recognized that everything about the Mac—the sleek design, the simple, user-friendly operating system, the soft-set texture of the mouse and keyboard, the micro-size magnetic power connector, the feel of its solidly crafted construction in my hands and on my lap—enhanced what was a very pleasurable and… ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1457))

- Many of the things that made the Mac experience so wonderful cannot be easily explained. To those who use them (and that number grows daily), Macs just seem to feel better, look better, and work better. When it comes to a product you use more than any other in your life, a small amount of “better” can be very meaningful. Following the trail blazed by those before me, I soon found that Apple had stolen my heart and seized control of my wallet. I remember the day I called Len to tell him how right he had been, and to thank him for his part in introducing me to the world of Apple. As with my undying preference for drinking Coke, it was now hard for me to imagine a time in the future when I wouldn’t be a customer of Apple. And while I would never allow myself to demonize the PC users in my life (as had previously been done to me), I occasionally did catch myself using words such as incredible, amazing, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful, stunning, awesome, and even magical when describing Apple products. Over the years my observations surrounding the all-encompassing consumer appetite for Apple products have led me to devise, test, and prove true many… ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1468))

- financial pages have warned us of Apple’s imminent collapse, even while the company’s bond with consumers has grown stronger. Whether it was with regard to the MacBook, iPod, iPhone, or iPad, Wall Street was oblivious to the paradigm shift taking place in how millions of consumers had begun to engage with their computing devices—and the impact that this change would have on their purchasing behavior. This oversight fed an atmosphere of bewilderment and doubt on Wall Street related to Apple’s capacity to sustain its record success with each new product launch, which, in turn, set the stage for some extraordinarily successful information arbitrage investments. How is it that Wall Street’s brightest could have been so wrong about Apple? You will not find a more disproportionate number of people carrying PCs and BlackBerrys (in comparison to Macs and iPhones) anywhere on earth than on the streets of New York’s Financial District. This is the epicenter of the business world and the one market, for better or worse, that Apple has for years ignored.

- This skepticism impaired Wall Street’s ability to see and acknowledge the magnitude of the authentic connection Apple had been organically garnering with a new generation of consumers. Unlike those from prior generations, these consumers were much more interested in user experience than product features. While Apple was winning over the hearts and minds of tens of millions of consumers around the globe, Wall Street remained distracted with concerns about the MacBook’s nonremovable battery, the iPod’s premium price points, the inferior music encryption quality on iTunes, the iPhone’s lack of a physical keyboard, and the iPad’s inability to display content requiring Flash players. Every newly launched Apple product was discredited with a laundry list of its “indispensable” missing features and the lower-priced competing products set to trigger Apple’s inevitable demise. Be it netbooks, me-too digital media players, or the ever-rotating “iPhone killer” of the month, there has never been a shortage of cheaper, fuller-featured alternatives to compete with Apple products.

Excited attention was deservedly centered on the iPhones as they were passed around and marveled at by everyone at the party. One thing was clear. For the vast majority of our guests that day, it was not a question of if but when they would be buying their own iPhones. Nearly every one of our friends and neighbors expressed one of the following three sentiments: (1) I intend to buy an iPhone tomorrow; (2) I intend to buy an iPhone once my existing mobile phone contract expires; or (3) I intend to buy an iPhone once the price drops to some predetermined dollar amount I have in my head as the maximum amount of money I am willing to spend on a mobile phone. The impact of this observation can be appreciated fully only when you take into account how, just hours earlier, few if any of these new prospective Apple customers had given serious consideration to buying an iPhone. Over the coming days I would replicate this observation while speaking with a broader group of family, neighbors, friends, and coworkers—while also reading hundreds of spontaneous Internet postings from real people on community blogs and Web sites (not technology review sites) discussing in detail their first hands-on experience with the iPhone, along with their intention to own one for themselves. My direct observations led me to devise, test, and prove true the following game-changing hypothesis: Hypothesis.

- SEEING THINGS FROM WALL STREET’S POINT OF VIEW Up until now, your potential investing success has hinged upon circumventing the opinions of investment “experts”; leveraging information uncovered through your own life, social network, and the Internet; and applying unconventional investigative due diligence techniques to measure firsthand the pulse of the products and companies that shape great investments. But the only way to ascertain that “what you know” is indeed something “they don’t know” is to assess your game-changing hypothesis from the viewpoint of those you are trying to outwit: the Wall Street investment professionals, the mainstream financial press, and the investors who follow their lead. Seeing things from a “Wall Street” point of view requires that you wipe your slate clean of everything you have observed and learned that supports your investment hypothesis. Beginning with a blank slate, you will now seek out any and all public information supporting or opposing your game-changing hypothesis. You will do this by exclusively using the information channels that are widely available to Wall Street professionals and those traditional investors who rely on their advice. By being astutely observant, unbiased, and unconventional, you have constructed an investment hypothesis based on game-changing information.… ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1529))

Skip over any and all mention of or reference to financial or technical analysis in your readings. You are interested in only the comments and opinions directly related to your investment hypothesis.

The focal point of my hypothesis is “iPhone to become one of the world’s top-selling mobile phones.” With that focal point in mind, journalist and analyst quotes in the vein of “The iPhone is sure to become a worldwide phenomenon” and “Watch out, Nokia and BlackBerry—Apple’s iPhone set to shake up if not dominate the mobile phone industry”… ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1563))

When compiling these quotes, be sure to include a reference to each quote’s original source. No single analyst or journalist should contribute more than one quote to each of your two lists, unless the timing of their quotes is more than thirty days apart. Upon completion of this exercise, separately add up the number of quotes in List A and List B. On the off chance that List A does not have any quotes, congratulations! You have just uncovered a very strong information imbalance. If List A has quotes, and List B does not have any quotes, then no information imbalance exists. If both Lists A and B have quotes, divide the total number of quotes on List A by the total number of quotes on List B. The resulting number is what I refer to as a consensus score. The higher the consensus score, the higher the likelihood that Wall Street is already aware of and in agreement with your investment hypothesis, in which case an information imbalance is unlikely. Any consensus score greater than 2 is indicative of information… ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1574))

- interpretation of information is highly subjective and not an exact science, I have found the consensus score to be a good tool—one that can help you quantify the level of consensus or uncertainty, with regard to your investment hypothesis, that exists on Wall Street. Upon conclusion of your investigative due diligence, you will use the consensus score as a guide to determining whether, based on your readings, Wall Street has accepted as fact the focal point of your game-changing hypothesis. The more uncertainty and conflicting opinions you find surrounding your investment hypothesis, the larger the information imbalance. A larger information imbalance will generally equate to a larger jump in stock price once the game-changing information you know to be true reaches a point of information parity on Wall Street. I repeat the consensus score exercise monthly for each of my active information arbitrage investments, computing an updated score based on published quotes from the prior thirty-day period. The moment the recomputed consensus score climbs above 2 (signifying information parity), I know to exit my position in the investment. This determination to exit an investment—i.e., to sell stock—is made independent of whether I have made or lost money on the investment.Having the strength of mind to exit a winning or losing investment at the point at which your game-changing hypothesis reaches information parity is central to becoming a successful information arbitrage investor. Once the information you have identified to be game changing becomes widely accepted as fact by other investors, your first-mover advantage is lost. Shake it off—if need be, take a loss—and refocus your energy on detecting the next game-changing investment opportunity. Any consensus score less than 2 indicates the existence of an information imbalance and an opportunity to initiate an information arbitrage investment. Any consensus score above 2 is indicative of information parity and should be taken as a sign to exit your information arbitrage investment. Applying this exercise to my game-changing iPhone hypothesis resulted in a consensus score just under 0.5, indicating a strong… ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1585))

Once you have developed the confidence to do so, you will find yourself with the willpower to pursue and exploit the information imbalances you discover. I often reread the iPhone quotes just given, both as a reminder of what is possible and to empower myself to trust my own observations and investigative due diligence over the biased speculation of others when pursuing new information arbitrage investments. Amazingly, it wasn’t for several years after iPhone’s public launch, only after the indisputable evidence of its success in handset sales had been reported, that Wall Street fully acknowledged iPhone as one of the world’s best-selling mobile phones. By the summer of 2010 the number of compiled analyst and journalist quotes supporting the focal point of my iPhone hypothesis (List A) exceeded by a large margin the number of compiled analyst and journalist quotes rejecting the focal point of my iPhone hypothesis (List B). The consensus score had finally climbed above 2, meaning that my game-changing iPhone investment hypothesis had reached a point of information parity. While the opportunities to uncover information imbalances might be greater for investment hypotheses involving small companies, simply to dismiss observations involving larger, more widely followed companies would be a colossal mistake—as evidenced by the many information imbalances surrounding the $250 billion company Apple.

- In chapter 4 we discussed using the 100× multiplier effect on OPM (Other People’s Money) to find a new way of thinking that could motivate us to change our behaviors. For example, anyone of us could easily save $10 by making simple changes in our spending patterns, such as going to the half-price matinee or skipping the overpriced movie popcorn. But we also considered the possibility that the $10 savings by itself might not be enough of an incentive to motivate some of us to change entrenched behaviors. However, we also witnessed how a simple mental calculation has the potential to change our motivation. Just take the $10 savings and multiply it by a hundred. With the magic of basic arithmetic, our motivation is now $1,000. And that might be enough to get us to pass on the popcorn. (Remember, OPM is money we will use for funding our Big Money account. Our working assumption is that, over a defined period of time, whatever contribution we make to our Big Money account has the potential to increase in value by a factor of one hundred, when invested aggressively to chase game-changing information.) For most of us, $1,000 has a greater motivational value than $10. With the newly discovered profit potential in mind, we look at the same tub of popcorn in a whole different light. It’s not simply about calories saved, but about the potential profit to be made from redeploying the savings into our Big Money account for aggressive investment in the stock market. (Remember, because our Big Money account is funded with OPM, it’s money we’re not afraid to lose. So we can allow ourselves to take bigger risks with it.)

Would it then be reasonable to conclude that you could multiply your chances of finding game-changing information by a similar factor? Every person crossing your path during the course of your daily life—family, neighbors, friends, coworkers, the UPS driver, hairdresser, electrician, pool boy, physician, veterinarian, pharmacist, and even the Starbucks barista—has the potential to help you widen your range of observation and your chances of discovering game-changing information. Beyond those in close physical proximity, you can use the power of the Internet and its many search engines and social networks to dramatically expand the size and scope of your “virtual network.” It’s an expansive universe, buzzing with information that’s only a mouse click away. In the process of exploring it, you will tap into an almost limitless source of potentially game-changing information, sending you well on the road to the discovery of untold investment opportunities. Thanks to the ambition and creativity of a global army of whiz kid technology programmers from Silicon Valley to Bangalore, India, information gathering—even of the game-changing variety—has never been easier.

- A transformational, if little talked about, development in the investing world has been taking place for more than fifteen years: the quiet emergence of investor social networks. Believe it or not, thanks to the early pioneering vision of engineers and developers at Yahoo!, investor social networking (even though no one at the time was using this terminology) has been around for as long, if not longer than, most of the self-proclaimed “social networks” of today: LinkedIn (a “professional network”) was launched in 2003; Facebook (a “social utility”), in 2004; Twitter (a “microblogging” platform), in 2006. By comparison, investors have been sharing game-changing information on Yahoo! Finance message boards since the mid-to-late 1990s! Indeed, almost a decade before Facebook was dreamed up in a college dorm room, Yahoo! Inc. (at the time known for its Web portal) launched Yahoo! Finance with little fanfare as its first stand-alone “niche community.” In this case, the niche was self-directed investors. The term social network wasn’t even part of the vernacular at the time. Yet, with millions of investors connecting daily via hundreds of thousands of messages posted to tens of thousands of public message boards, that’s effectively what it was and, in many ways, still is today. By force of inertia as much as anything else, Yahoo! Finance has managed to hold onto its status as the undisputed eight-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. That’s not to say its preeminence hasn’t been challenged. In April ([Location 1771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1771))

The lesser-known story is the rise of upstart competitor InvestorVillage.com. IV, as it is affectionately called by its users, was at the right place at the right time, catching a lucky break in mid-2006 when Yahoo!

This change drove many loyal users to seek refuge in more hospitable surroundings. InvestorVillage attracts hundreds of thousands of self-directed investors each month versus the millions of users enjoyed by Yahoo! Finance. Yet the quality, diversity, and sharing nature of the investors on InvestorVillage make it my hands-down favorite among the investor social networking sites.

But when used as one of the many weapons in an information-gathering and investigative due diligence arsenal, investor social networks represent an extraordinary accumulation of brainpower, and it would be foolish not to tap into it. The primary thing that a stock message board service and its collective brain power can do for you is give you a timing advantage. And not only do you have access to game-changing information before other investors do (hence the “early bird” timing advantage), but you also have access to five, ten, or even a hundred times as many pieces of game-changing information as you would on your own.

- “COOPETITION” In his book The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki explores the potential that large groups of people have for generating smarter answers to questions and better solutions to problems collectively than any one person might produce on his own. Surowiecki also studies situations that pose unique challenges to his premise. For example, he cites paying taxes and determining appropriate wages as examples of what he calls “cooperation problems,” which he defines as “problems involv[ing] the challenge of getting self-interested, distrustful people to work together, even when narrow self-interest would seem to dictate that no individual should take part.”12 To his examples I would add the challenge of trying to determine the potential upside of an investment in a given company at a specific point. Put another way, if I believe that Delcath represents a strong information arbitrage investment opportunity, why should I share my opinion on a stock message board with total strangers who could then easily compete with (i.e. bid against) me for those same shares, increasing their cost? Well, believe it or not, there are many reasons why this might not be as irrational an act as it might seem at first blush. For example, even though you think you are correct, you might want to see if other investors agree with you—much like seeking a second opinion for a medical condition. If they don’t, perhaps they will push you to do better due diligence and make a smarter decision for yourself. Or you might see some karmic value in sharing your research and opinions with other investors. If you share your painstaking research and help someone else make money, it’s not unreasonable to assume they might wish to share their best information discovery and due diligence with you, too, in the hopes of… ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1882))

I didn’t consciously think, “Hey, I’m going to tap into the wisdom of crowds.” It just sort of came with the territory, I suppose. It’s something we take for granted online. To quote Surowiecki again, “under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.”13 ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1916))

Almost every one of them recommended using 5W-30 or at least a 30-weight motor oil. (I still don’t know what the weight means exactly; all I knew was that it was better to be safe than sorry.) So I ran out and picked up a quart of 5W-30. If no one online was recommending 40-weight, that was good enough for me. You can leverage the wisdom of the crowd on a stock message board to similar effect. With a little effort, you might find someone—whether a neighbor, a friend on Facebook, or a stock message board user—willing and able to provide you with valuable information in its purest form: that is, specialized information or knowledge not commonly shared. Perhaps this person is a beverage distributor and can help you uncover the next hot trend in energy/health drinks. Maybe he’s a physician who can help you decipher a scientific abstract discussing the benefits of some new therapeutic drug you’ve stumbled across and are considering investing in. This information might be directly relevant to a stock you’re considering buying or have already invested in.

Stock prices and company valuations are of zero importance to information arbitrage investors, yet having a basic understanding of what owning a share of stock in a company represents is helpful if for nothing more than improving your ability to converse intelligently with other self-directed investors. If a single share of the Emerging Youth Apparel Company you want to invest in (hypothetical stock symbol EYAC) were trading for $10, you could afford to buy three hundred shares with the $3,000 in your Big Money account (not including brokerage commissions, which range between $7 and $15 per trade for online brokers). So how much ownership in the company does your three hundred shares represent? Figuring out your total ownership is an easy, fun exercise that will provide you with tremendous perspective on what you are actually purchasing each time you buy stock in a company. To do this, simply find out how many shares of stock the prospective company has divided itself into by searching the “shares outstanding” field of the Key Statistics section ([Location 1995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EXSMLC&location=1995))

To determine your percentage of ownership in the company, divide the number of shares outstanding by the number of shares you either own or are seeking to purchase. If the entire Emerging Youth Apparel Company were divided up into three thousand total shares of stock, your three-hundred-share purchase would mean that you now owned 10 percent of the company (300/3,000). That means that 10 percent of the company’s profits belong to you. If the company were to distribute 100 percent of its profits via dividend payments to shareholders (which they rarely do), you would receive a check for 10 percent of the company’s profits every year, no different than if you owned 10 percent of a local pizzeria. Of course, it’s more realistic that the company would be divided into something like thirty million shares, meaning that your three-hundred-share purchase would give you ownership of just one one thousandth of 1 percent of the company.

- For most stock transactions, most of the time the convenience of placing a market order far outweighs the risk that the order will cause you to overpay or undersell. The time to consider using a limit order is when buying or selling a relatively large number of shares in a relatively small or sparsely traded company whose stock does not have a large, active market of buyers and sellers. How will you know when this is the case? Here’s a rule of thumb I use: if the number of shares you are planning to buy or sell, when multiplied by one thousand, equals a number that is larger than your stock’s “average daily trading volume” (listed on your stock’s Yahoo! Finance quote page as AvgVol), you might consider placing a limit order. I also tend to place limit orders for any total stock purchase exceeding $25,000. Until you are comfortable with the process of placing limit orders, I suggest you do so with guidance from a representative at your online broker. The mission of all discount and online brokers is to assist and educate newbie investors so that they become proficient self-directed investors. Your customer service rep should be happy to assist.

- Like fundamental and technical analysis, the price target game is one I have zero interest in playing. For this reason, I am usually hesitant to purchase anything but “in the money” call stock options—that is, call option contracts in which the guaranteed purchase, or “strike,” price is less than the company’s current stock price. When purchasing call option contracts, I generally seek out the highest available strike price that is equal to or less than the current stock price of the company in which I’m seeking to invest. For example, assume that an $11.00 stock offers call option strike prices of $5.00, $7.50, $10.00, $12.50, and $15.00. I would purchase the option contract with the $10.00 strike price. If the stock price were $9.75, I would purchase the $7.50 strike price. Not exactly rocket science. This middle-of-the-road, measured-risk strategy usually results in my being able to increase my purchasing power by a factor of five to ten, resulting in investment returns that are five to ten times larger than if I were simply to purchase shares of the company’s stock.

- Your challenge as an information arbitrage investor is to choose an expiration date that buys you enough time until Wall Street and the investing public acknowledge the validity of the game-changing information you have uncovered. Only then will your perceived information imbalance reach a point of information parity in the market—and the share price of your investment react accordingly. For this reason, I generally purchase option contracts with expiration dates ranging from six to nine months away. Since publicly traded companies are required to announce sales and earnings every three months, the six-to-nine-month window ensures ample opportunity for the anticipated dissemination of game-changing information to the market. For event-driven information arbitrage investments—such as those involving FDA drug approvals or new product launches—it is wise to pick an expiration date that is at least one to two months beyond the anticipated event date, to account for any unexpected delays. And just because option contracts come with expiration dates does not mandate that you hold on to them through the option contract’s expiration.

- Just as with stock investments, any information arbitrage–based investment in an option contract should be sold (for profit or loss) immediately upon your determination that the information imbalance that served as the impetus for the investment decision has reached a point of information parity in the market. Option contracts that have positive value on their day of expiration (as defined as a bid price of $0.05 or greater) should be sold well in advance of the 4:00 PM EST market close. Otherwise, your online brokerage account will trigger a purchase of all shares represented by your option contract at the strike price—a mistake I once learned the hard way. Once you have chosen both a strike price and an option contract expiration date, you are ready to proceed with your call option contract order. As with stock, each option contract has its very own symbol. Now that you understand the purpose of an option contract’s strike price and expiration date, either decoding or constructing for yourself a stock’s option contract symbol should be a breeze. EYAC110715C10 would be the symbol for a call option contract on the Emerging Youth Apparel Company with an expiration date of July 2011 and a strike price of $10.
