## Highlights
- Wall Street’s modern financiers got rich by exploiting their control of the public’s money: their essential trick was to take in—and sell out—the public at opportune moments. Buffett shunned this game, as well as the more venal excesses for which Wall Street is deservedly famous. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=109))
- He never forgot that underneath each stock and bond, no matter how arcane, there lay a tangible, ordinary business. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=125))
- In such a complex age, what was stunning about Buffett was his applicability. Most of what Buffett did was imitable by the average person (this is why the multitudes flocked to ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=133))
- Omaha). Buffett’s genius was largely a genius of character—of patience, discipline, and rationality. These were common enough virtues, but they were rare in the heat of financial passions, and indispensable to anyone who would test his mettle in the stock market. In this sense, Buffett’s character and career unfolded as a sort of public tutorial on investing and on American business. Buffett ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=134))
- was aware of his role from the very beginning, and he nurtured a curious habit of chronicling his escapades even as he lived them. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=137))
- He was famous for quipping that it was the bankers “who should have been wearing the ski masks,”3 or that, as he said to a friend who had been offered a job in finance, “you won’t encounter much traffic taking the high road in Wall Street.”4 ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=141))
- When he went to Paris, his only reaction was that he had no interest in sight-seeing and that the food was better in Omaha. His talent sprang from his unrivaled independence of mind and ability to focus on his work and shut out the world, yet those same qualities exacted a toll. Once, when Buffett was visiting the publisher Katharine Graham on Martha’s Vineyard, a friend remarked on the beauty of the sunset. Buffett replied that he hadn’t focused on it, as though it were necessary for him to exert a deliberate act of concentration to “focus” on a sunset.7 Even at his California beachfront vacation home, Buffett would work every day for weeks and not go near the water. Like other prodigies, he paid a price. Having been raised in a ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=153))
- home with more than its share of demons, he lived within an emotional fortress. The few people who shared his office had no knowledge of the inner man, even after decades. Even his children could scarcely recall a time when he broke through his surface calm and showed some feeling. Though part of him is a showman or preacher, he is essentially a private person. Peter Lynch, the mutual-fund wizard, visited Buffett in the 1980s and was struck by the tranquillity in his inner sanctum. His archives, neatly alphabetized in metal filing cabinets, looked as files had in another era. He had no armies of traders, no rows of electronic screens, as Lynch did. Buffett had no price charts, no computer—only a newspaper clipping from 1929 and an antique ticker under a glass dome. The two of them paced the floor, recounting their storied histories, what they had bought, what they had sold. Where Lynch had kicked out his losers every few weeks, Buffett had owned mostly the same few stocks for years and years. Lynch felt a pang, as though he had traveled back in time. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=159))
- His consuming passion—and pleasure—is his work, or, as he calls it, his canvas. It is there that he revealed the secrets of his trade, and left a self-portrait. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=169))
- Graham, in the introduction, frankly acknowledged that investing in common stocks seemed “discredited.”11 At the market’s recent lows, a third of American industry was selling at less than its liquidation value.12 The experts who only a few years back had seen in Wall Street a place of unending milk and honey now advised, as one said, that “common stocks as such are not investments at all.”13 Gerald M. Loeb, a commentator whose popular book The Battle for Investment Survival appeared at about the same time as Security Analysis, held that investing for profit was impossible. If the Dow Jones Industrial Average could register 381.17 in 1929 and 41.22 in 1932, who was to say what “real” value was? “I do not think anyone really knows,” he averred, “when a particular security is ‘cheap’ or ‘dear.’ ” Instead, Loeb counseled, “It is necessary to speculate … to foresee [the] tides.” ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=864))
- Loeb stressed that the thing to watch was not the earnings of an enterprise but the public psychology: The importance of full consideration of popular sentiment, expectations and opinion—and their effect on the price of the security—cannot be overstressed.15 Yet how was one to gauge the public sentiment? The chief method was to follow the prices of stocks themselves, to “watch the tape.” If a stock declined it should be sold, and quickly; if it advanced, it should be purchased. It was not enough to buy something cheap—one must only buy “just as it starts to get dearer.”16 If Loeb failed to grasp the paradox of millions of investors each reacting to one another and yet all trying to stay a step ahead of the crowd, it was not lost on Graham and Dodd: For stock speculation is largely a matter of A trying to decide what B, C and D are likely to think—with B, C and D trying to do the same.17 Security Analysis offered an escape from such a trap. Graham and Dodd urged that investors pay attention not to the tape, but to the businesses beneath the stock certificates. By focusing on the earnings, assets, future prospects, and so forth, one could arrive at a notion of a company’s “intrinsic value” that was independent of its market price. The market, they argued, was not a “weighing machine” that determined value precisely. Rather, it was a “voting ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=873))
- machine,” in which countless people registered choices that were the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.18 At times, these choices would be out of line with rational valuations. The trick was to invest when prices were far below intrinsic value, and to trust in the market’s tendency to correct. Given that the Depression had far from run its course, it was a remarkable time to assert one’s faith in markets. Many companies’ shares were being quoted for less than the value of their cash in the bank.19 But Graham, a classicist, could recognize Wall Street’s gloom as part of an all-too-human cycle: That enormous profits should have turned into still more colossal losses, that new theories should have been developed and later discredited, that unlimited optimism should have been succeeded by the deepest despair are all in strict accord with age-old tradition.20 Graham dissected common stocks, corporate bonds, and speculative senior securities (what Michael Milken would call junk bonds) as the biologist did the frog. At first blush, then, Security Analysis was a textbook for a profession still in the making.*… ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=888))
- anticipate that next fellow, and the fellow after that. The Graham-and-Dodd investor saw a stock as a share of a business, whose value, over time, would correspond to that of the entire enterprise. It is an almost unbelievable fact that Wall Street never asks, “How much is the business selling for?”21 That was the question Graham and Dodd proposed as a guide to valuing stocks. It was not an exact science, but (and this was key) one did not need exactitude—only the skill to identify the occasional company that was priced well below its value. To use a homely simile, it is quite possible to… ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=901))
- Left unresolved was the nagging question of what to do when a cheap stock, after its purchase, became even cheaper. For if prices were sometimes wrong, the authors admitted, it could take an “inconveniently long time” for them to adjust.23 The answer appeared the year before Buffett arrived at Columbia. The Intelligent Investor boiled Graham’s philosophy down to three words—“margin of safety.”24 An investor, he said, ought to insist on a gap—a big… ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=910))
- room for error in driving an automobile. If the margin was great enough, the investor ought to be safe. But what if he was not? Suppose, that is, that the stock kept dropping. Assuming that nothing about the business had changed, Graham said, the investor should pay no heed to the ticker, no matter how grim its tidings. Indeed, an investor who became unduly discouraged by a market drop and who allowed himself to be stampeded into selling at a poor price was “perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage.”25 Basic advantage? Most investors did not know they had one. Graham explained in a parable: Imagine that in some private business you own a small share that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible.… Often, on the other hand, Mr. Market lets his… ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=915))
- It is extremely difficult to commit one’s capital in the face of ridicule—and this is why Graham was invaluable. He liked to say, “You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you.”38 Picking a stock depended not on the whim of the crowd, but on the facts. And Buffett took this to heart, partly because he saw Graham in idealized terms—as a “hero,” like his father.39 ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=984))
- Unlike Graham, Buffett would not give stock tips. The students would try to get one, indirectly. They would ask about a company with seeming casualness, but Buffett would just laugh them off. Zahn even read aloud a plaintive ballad: Biz-whiz counselor This is our cry Why oh why won’t you tell us what YOU buy? Buffett laughed—but no dice. The young salesman actually advised the class not to take tips from brokers. He said they weren’t to be trusted.64 The entire subject of sharing information touched a nerve, as though he considered it fraught with the potential ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1130))
- for abuse on either side. He regarded the majority of tips as a waste, which is why brokers passed them along. But good ideas—his ideas—he treated as intensely private. He regarded them as his creation—as a tiny bit sacred. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1137))
- With the partnerships up and running, Buffett was troubled by a seemingly bizarre concern. As he wrote to “Big Boy” (Jerry Orans), he was afraid that his estate would eventually be so big that the money might spoil his children. He couldn’t figure out “the logical thing to do with the dough.” This is no problem now but viewing things optimistically it may become one and my thinking produces no results. I am sure I don’t want to leave a barrel of money to my kids, unless I do it at an elderly age when I have time to see what the tree has produced. However, how much to leave them, what to do with the balance, etc. bothers me considerably.1 Buffett was twenty-six. He had modest savings and no steady income. Another young man fretting over his unearned ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1305))
- millions might be worthy of a snicker, yet in Buffett there was no hint of bravado. He knew, as much as anyone can, that he would be rich—not just successful, but rich enough to have trouble figuring out what to do with it all. He had anxiety over spending his “dough”—before, indeed, he had any—but not over making it. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1313))
- Then he offered the terms. The Davises, as limited partners, would get all of the profits that Buffett could earn up to 4 percent. They would share any remaining profits—75 percent to the Davises and 25 percent to Buffett. ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1346))
- Buffett insisted on not disclosing his stocks because he was afraid that someone would copy him—thus making it more expensive if he wanted to buy more. He wouldn’t talk to anyone—he maintained that he was afraid to talk in bed because his wife might hear.10 ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1390))
- People who signed up intuitively grasped that Buffett’s Garbo-like loneness was part of the appeal. When Buffett insisted on secrecy, it was not merely to prevent leaks, but also to prevent intrusions, and to maintain that sweet independence. He wanted no amateur tipsters or second-guessers. For a stock to merit investment, Buffett had to persuade himself of it, and if he did, what was the use of other opinions? Temperamentally, he mistrusted advice-givers and financial soothsayers. If the basis for a stock was popular opinion and opinion changed, then what? He was confident that his own analysis would be less fickle. Buffett wanted only one thing from outside: capital. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1427))
- Buffett was so consistently analytical—unusually so. On form, his emotional pendulum did not swing as far as other people’s. There was no pushing him to an expression of, say, anger, despondency, recklessness, or other feeling outside of his customary Pepsi-drenched high spirits. He was always logical and even-tempered, always in the same, circumscribed arc. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1516))
- This is the cornerstone of our investment philosophy: Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results.43 ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1640))
- He ridiculed the fund managers who took the opposite tack—which is to say, most of those working on Wall Street. Diversification had become an article of faith; fund managers were commonly stuffing their portfolios with hundreds of different stocks. Paraphrasing Billy Rose, Buffett doubted that they could intelligently select so many securities any more than a sheik could get to “know” a harem of one hundred girls. Anyone owning such numbers of securities … is following what I call the Noah School of Investing—two of everything. Such investors should be piloting arks.26 A portfolio with scores of securities would be relatively unaffected if any one stock fell, but similarly unaffected should an issue rise. Indeed, as the number of stocks grew, the portfolio would come to mimic the market averages. That would be a safe and perhaps a reasonable goal for the novice, but in Buffett’s view, it undermined the very purpose of the professional investor, who presumably ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1815))
- was being paid to beat the average. Owning so many stocks was an admission that one could not pick the winners. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1824))
- When it came to money, Buffett seemed to have twin personalities—it was nothing to him and it was everything. He had an overly reverent view of money’s proper role, as if spending were a sort of sinfulness. Even when he dieted, he inserted money into the equation. He would write a $10,000 check to his daughter, payable on such-and-such a date unless his weight had dropped. Little Susie would try to ply him with ice cream or drag him to McDonald’s—but it was useless. Her daddy didn’t want the ice cream as much as he wanted to keep the money. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1854))
- Susie tolerated him perhaps because Warren, in his absentminded way, was unfailingly good-natured. As she said to her sister, “You can’t get mad at someone who is so funny.” Moreover, she, and even the children, understood that Warren was on a sort of spiritual mission that diverted him from the more routine aspects of family living. They referred to his office, only half-jokingly, as the “temple.” His work was a “canvas”—a work of art. Susie, referring to Buffett’s maestrolike self-absorption, once remarked to Marshall Weinberg, their Manhattan stockbroker chum, “Let’s face it—I’m married to Artur Rubinstein.”40 ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=1920))
- Inevitably, the advice of such partners was to sell until the future was “clear.” For some reason, market commentators suffer a peculiar blind spot. They routinely assume that once the “uncertainty” of the immediate moment is lifted they will have a plain view of the future unto Judgment Day. The fact that they did not foresee the present uncertainty does not deter them from thinking that no new clouds will trouble the future. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2044))
- Fashion” investing, he wrote, does not completely satisfy my intellect (or perhaps my prejudices), and most definitely does not fit my temperament. I will not invest my own money based upon such an approach—hence, I will most certainly not do so with your money.9 ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2095))
- According to his son Peter, Buffett identified with The Glenn Miller Story, the Hollywood epic in which the band leader searches to find his “sound.” For Buffett, the right sound was a matter not just of making money, but of superior reasoning. Being right on a stock had something of the purity of a perfect move in chess; it had an intellectual resonance. Glenn Miller or Bobby Fischer, Buffett simply refused to go outside his ken. We will not go into businesses where technology which is away [sic] over my head is crucial to the investment decision. I know about as much about semiconductors or integrated circuits as I do of the mating habits of the chrzaszez.10 ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2099))
- For Buffett, Keynes’s relevance during the Go-Go era was his keen understanding of how crowds could influence market prices. The stock market is a crowd, consisting of whoever is following prices at any given moment. This amorphous assemblage revalues prices every day, even every hour. Yet the outlook for a given business—say, a Walt Disney—changes ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2166))
- far more slowly. The public’s ardor for Mary Poppins is unlikely to change from a Tuesday to a Wednesday, or even over a month or two. Most of the fluctuations in Disney’s shares, therefore, derive from changes not in the business but in the way that the business is perceived. And the pros were preoccupied merely with outwitting the crowd, that is, with staying a step ahead of its fleeting shifts in opinion. Again, Keynes: We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.16 One sees in Buffett a strongly similar suspicion of public opinion. Buffett viewed a crowd as a potential source of ([Location 2169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2169))
- a sort of intellectual contagion. It was the author of acts and feelings which, rather than being a summing-up of the parts, no one individual among the crowd would have subscribed to alone.17 Buffett illustrated this with an allegory about an oil prospector, who arrived at heaven’s gate only to hear the distressing news that the “compound” reserved for oilmen was full. Given permission by Saint Peter to say a few words, the prospector shouted, “Oil discovered in hell!”—whereupon every oilman in heaven departed for the nether reaches. Impressed, Saint Peter told him there was now plenty of room. Quoting Buffett: The prospector paused. “No,” he said, “I think I’ll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all.”18 ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2176))
- When the game is no longer being played your way, it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong, bound to lead to trouble, etc. I have been scornful of such behavior by others in the past. I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evaluate conditions as they were—not as they are. Essentially I am out of step with present conditions. On one point, however, I am clear. I will not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand even though it may mean forgoing large, and apparently easy, profits to embrace an approach which I don’t fully understand, have not practiced successfully and which, possibly, could lead to substantial permanent loss of capital.23 ([Location 2213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2213))
- But what about the famed access of New Yorkers to “inside information? ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2331))
- Buffett replied, “With enough inside information and a million dollars you can go broke in a year.”42 This was a very Midwestern and revealing remark. The subtext was that virtue could be as rewarding as sin—a notion directly counter to the received wisdom on Wall Street. ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2332))
- Buffett reminded partners of a seemingly lost distinction: “Price is what you pay, value is what you get.”50 ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2389))
- Ringwalt stated his philosophy in simple terms: “There is no such thing as a bad risk. There are only bad rates.”32 This was an ([Location 2766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2766))
- insight worth its weight in gold. Buffett, who had learned this truth at the racetrack, felt that Ringwalt was another of his guys. Each liked to take risks, but only when the odds favored them. Ringwalt also was possibly the cheapest of the long line of tightwads in Buffett’s acquaintance. He even left his coat in the office when he went downtown for lunch so as to avoid a coat check. In 1967, Buffett asked if Ringwalt could stop by Kiewit Plaza to discuss a matter that Buffett said would take only fifteen minutes. By then, Buffett had learned from Charles Heider, an Omaha broker, how much it would take to persuade Ringwalt to part with National Indemnity. “How does it happen that you never sold your company?” Buffett asked. “Because only crooks and bankrupt people have wanted it.” “What other reason?” “I would not want the other stockholders to take less per share than I would receive myself.” “What else?” Buffett prodded him. “I would not want my employees to worry about losing their jobs.” “What else?” Buffett insisted. “I would want it to remain in Omaha.” “What else?” “Isn’t that enough?” “What is your stock worth?” Buffett asked, getting to the point. “The market value is $33 per share, but the stock is worth $50 ([Location 2767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2767))
- per share.” ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2780))
- “I will take it,” Buffett said. ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2780))
- None of these multimillionaires needed to work, but Buffett understood that most people, regardless of what they say, are looking for appreciation as much as they are for money. He made it clear that he was depending on them, and he underlined this by showing admiration for their work and by trusting them to run their own operations. ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2803))
- In 1970, with the dissolution of Buffett Partnership, Buffett personally became the owner of 29 percent of Berkshire’s stock. He installed himself as chairman and, for the first time, composed the letter to shareholders in Berkshire’s annual report. ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=2830))
- High stock prices had been a problem for Buffett all around. Since folding the partnership, he had not been able to find bargains. Going into 1972, Berkshire’s insurance company had a portfolio worth $101 million, of which only $17 million was invested in stocks. Buffett had put the rest in bonds. But little by little, he began to creep back into the game. Once again, the catalyst for his metamorphosis was Wall Street. Fund managers, who had been stunned by the collapse of Go-Go, had retreated into a shell. Their funds were now clustered in a group of big, well-known growth stocks, such as Xerox, Kodak, Polaroid, Avon, and Texas Instruments, which were dubbed the nifty fifty. In the prevailing view, these companies, unlike the small high-fliers of the Go-Go era, would grow forever. They were thus said to be “safe”—indeed, safe at any price. By 1972, the nifty fifty were trading at an astronomical eighty times earnings. Wall Street had drawn a moral from Go-Go, but not the right one. The funds had converged on “safer” stocks, but ([Location 3042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3042))
- risk is never wedded to one stock or another; it is present wherever investors mindlessly imitate one another. ([Location 3050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3050))
- Buffett’s decision to sell notes was based on a Buffett rule of thumb: get the money when it is cheap. (If you wait to borrow until you need a loan, it is likely to be when others are also borrowing, when—perforce—rates will be higher.) ([Location 3108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3108))
- Buffett’s rare ability to separate his emotions from the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a big part of his success. In the sixties, when he had been making tons of money, he had been full of fearful prophecies. But now, with his portfolio underwater, he was salivating. Writing to Berkshire’s shareholders, his optimism was evident: ([Location 3208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3208))
- What Buffett did not do was buy or sell stocks on the basis of macroeconomic predictions. ([Location 3251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3251))
- He could not size up how the country’s problems would influence the shares of the Washington Post. His genius was in not trying. ([Location 3267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3267))
- As he had once told his partners, the future was never clear. What was very clear to him was that certain ([Location 3277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3277))
- securities were available for less—far less—than the value of their assets. ([Location 3277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3277))
- Munger was so deeply skeptical of his fellow man that Buffett dubbed him “the abominable no-man.” This, in fact, provided a clue to Munger’s unique talent as Buffett’s consigliere. His approach to life—of particular use to an investor—was to ask what could go wrong. He liked to quote the algebraist Carl Jacobi: “Invert, always invert.” Thus, at a high school commencement, Munger gave a sermon not on the qualities that would lead to happiness, but on those that would guarantee a miserable life. Always invert ([Location 3317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3317))
- What the “numbers” told Buffett was that California chocoholics were willing to pay a premium price for the See’s well-regarded brand. But the price for the company was $30 million. Buffett and Munger were dissuaded by the paltry level of the See’s book value, and would go no higher than $25 million.4 There the talks ended. In this case, Buffett had made a common mistake. Investors often assume that book value approximates, or at least is suggestive of, what a company is “worth.” In fact, the two express quite different concepts. Book value is equal to the capital that has gone into a business, plus whatever profits have been retained. An investor is concerned with how much can be taken out in the future; that is what determines a company’s “worth” (or its “intrinsic value,” as Buffett would say). Suppose, for a moment, that a new company invested in candy-making equipment, stores, and inventory identical to those of See’s. Its book value would be the same, but the name on its candy box would be unknown. And this upstart, having far less earning power, would be worth far less. Since book value is blind to intangibles such as brand name, for a company such as See’s it is meaningless as an indicator of value. But Buffett and Munger got lucky. See’s rang back and took the $25 million—Buffett’s biggest investment by far. With seeming suddenness, his empire now included candy, textiles, retail, insurance, banking, publishing, and trading stamps.

- Yet Munger was a formidable armchair psychologist and, in particular, a student of behavior. He saw the devil in such phenomena as the inability of people to change their minds, or what he termed “first-conclusion bias”: “This is why organizations solicit public pledges. Hell, it’s the reason for the marriage ceremony. ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=3441))
- Buffett could not have disagreed more. The same week, he penned an essay for Forbes, attacking the herd instincts of pension-fund managers and their age-old rationalization. The future is never clear; you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. Uncertainty actually is the friend of the buyer of long-term values. ([Location 4664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4664))
- Through the early eighties one can discern three recurring themes. One was Buffett’s dread fear of inflation, inherited from his father. He seemed to have taken to heart Lenin’s dictum that the way to ruin capitalism was to ruin its money, and he doubted that politicians had the willpower to slow the printing press. Thus, Buffett saw inflation—as it turned out, erroneously—as a permanent affliction. “Like virginity, a stable price level seems capable of maintenance, but not of restoration.”30 Indeed, he feared that inflation might spell the demise of the long-term bond.31 This proved to be dead wrong. However, Buffett’s insights enabled him (and more attentive readers) to minimize inflation’s devastating consequences. His appreciation of its effect on the insurance business was especially dynamic. Inflation was destroying bond values, and the insurance industry had most of its capital in bonds—which previously had been the prudent course. What Buffett grasped was the vicious toll that the insurers’ investments exacted on their main business. As bond losses mounted, Buffett saw that insurers would be unwilling to follow their usual course of selling assets to pay off claims, because any company that unloaded bonds would have to admit to a crushing loss of capital. Then ([Location 4732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4732))
- again, he recognized, the money that insurers had invested in bonds was not theirs to keep. For the source of funds to purchase and hold those bonds is a pool of money derived from policyholders and claimants (with changing faces)—money which, in effect, is temporarily on deposit with the insurer.32 The alternative method of raising cash was for insurers to write more policies, which Buffett judged would cause the industry to write as much business as possible, driving premiums down to unprofitable levels and spurring huge losses in underwriting. All this unfolded as writ. Berkshire itself had minimal exposure to long-term bonds, the purchase of which, Buffett noted, was equivalent to “selling money” at a fixed price for thirty years. In an inflationary era, this was no less suicidal than agreeing to set a price on Hathaway yarn for the year 2010. Alas, understanding inflation did not provide immunity to it. Buffett pointed out, with no little agony, that when he had taken over Berkshire the book value of one share could have bought one half-ounce of gold and that, after fifteen years in which he had managed to raise the book value from $19.46 a share to $335.85, it would still buy the same half-ounce.33 The best that he could do was to invest in companies that might resist inflation’s ravages, such as General Foods and R. J. Reynolds Industries. Buffett figured that well-known consumer brands, such as Post cereals and Winston cigarettes, would be able to raise prices at a pace with inflation. He also bought hard-commodity stocks, such as Aluminum Co. of America, Cleveland-Cliffs Iron, Handy & Harman, and Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical. But as Buffett would remind his readers, neither Berkshire nor ([Location 4742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4742))

- Many managements apparently were overexposed in impressionable childhood years to the story in which the imprisoned handsome prince is released from a toad’s body by a kiss from a beautiful princess. Consequently, they are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability of Company T(arget)…. We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles.35 ([Location 4768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4768))
- Buffett wrote that for the 1981 report, when the merger wave was new. The next year, he could not resist a reprise. Many CEOs were paying for acquisitions by issuing shares. Buffett subjected this seemingly innocent technique to a rather savage dissection. In the first place, he observed, the acquiring CEOs weren’t only buying, they were also selling. With the issuance of new shares, each ongoing stockholder wound up owning proportionately less of the company than before. The CEOs disguised this fact by using the language of a buyer: “Company A to Acquire Company B.” However, “Clearer thinking about the matter would result if a more awkward but more accurate description were used: ‘Part of A sold to acquire B.’ …”36 Why was this disguise employed? Most stocks, including most acquirers’ stocks, were cheap. In such a case, an acquiring CEO was shopping with unattractive currency, like an American in Paris when the dollar was undervalued. As he collected corporate trinkets he was parting with his own company on the cheap. Buffett suggested that such managers and directors could “sharpen their thinking” by asking if they would be willing to sell all of their company on the same basis as they were selling part of it. And if not, why were they selling part of it? A cumulation of small managerial stupidities will produce a major stupidity—not a major triumph. (Las Vegas has been built upon the wealth transfers that occur when people engage in seemingly-small disadvantageous capital transactions.)37 What got under Buffett’s skin was that CEOs were enlarging their personal empires at the expense of shareholders—the very group they were pledged to serve. Such managers “might better ([Location 4772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4772))
- consider a career in government.”38 Buffett likened corporate kingpins to bureaucrats precisely because he knew it would taunt them. In life, Buffett was friendly with many of those CEOs; he sat on their boards. In his letters, he was careful not to name them. Still, he divorced himself from his natural corporate allies. (On white-collar crime: “It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun.”)39 There was a whiff about him of Dust Bowl progressivism, yet Buffett was anything but a Prairie socialist. Where the latter loathed businessmen as capitalists, Buffett arrived at… ([Location 4787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4787))
- This suggests Buffett’s most pervasive theme, which was the proper relationship between corporate managers and shareholders, i.e., between the stewards of capital and its owners. In his view, the mangers of other people’s money bore a heavy burden, which he demonstrated in 1980, when a change in federal law forced Berkshire to divest the Rockford bank into a separate company. Buffett calculated that the bank was worth 4 percent of Berkshire; then he allowed each shareholder to choose between keeping his or her proportional stake in Berkshire and in the bank, or to take more of one and less of the other, depending on which slice (bank or Berkshire) a holder might prefer. The only one who did not get a choice was… ([Location 4794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4794))
- corporate charity plan, conceived by Charlie Munger. For each of its one million shares, then trading at $470, Berkshire would contribute $2 to charities of that shareholder’s choice. Someone who owned one hundred shares could designate the recipients for $200 in gifts, and so on. At other public companies, the choice of charities came from the CEO and the directors. (Only the money came from the stockholders.) Buffett saw this as sheer hypocrisy; not only did the CEO give away his stockholders’ dough, he then got to play the big shot at his alma mater, etc. Thus, “Many corporate managers deplore governmental allocation of the taxpayer’s dollar but embrace enthusiastically their own allocation of the shareholder’s dollar.”40 By such words and deeds, Buffett was shaping Berkshire into a very personal vehicle. In effect, he was re-creating it as a public form of the Buffett Partnership. Some of his two thousand or so shareholders were in fact his ex-partners, though most were not. But one purpose of his letters was to attract and knit together a shareholder group who would behave like his partners—in other words, who would stick with him. The uniqueness of this approach is hard to overstate. At virtually every public company in America, high share turnover is not only the rule, it is devoutly encouraged by the executives. The typical CEO… ([Location 4800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4800))
- Berkshire’s reports, in fact, disclosed enough information for readers to evaluate the company on the least favorable of terms. As during the partnership, Buffett repeatedly assured investors that there was no chance of maintaining prior rates of success. He was still the dutiful parishioner; confession soothed him. If there was a flaw in the reports, it was that Buffett was occasionally cloying and autoreferential. There was a winking quality to some of his gags, as though he were looking over his own shoulder. Moreover, his confessions of error and ([Location 4838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4838))

- When the day arrived, Louie and his three sons were running the store. Mrs. B remained its chairman and full-time boss of the carpet department. Buffett, having heard that she was ready to sell, went to see Louie first—to sound him out on price and ensure that he understood Mrs. B’s thickly accented English.12 Before the sale, Buffett looked at the Furniture Mart’s tax returns, which showed that it was earning about $15 million a ([Location 4985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4985))

The average home buyer probably looks at more pieces of paper than Buffett did in spending $60 million. His approach seems strange in a modern context, but it was in accord with the notion of J. P. Morgan, Sr., that the principal judgments in business are those concerning character. In Buffett’s terms, if he couldn’t trust the Blumkins, why become their partner?

- One was tempted to ask, as so often with Buffett, were things really so simple? The answer is that he had a genius for keeping them simple. In his 1982 letter, just before the deal with Mrs. B, he printed a “Want Ad” describing his criteria for acquisitions. He promised to respond to offers quickly—“customarily within five minutes.” What Buffett was saying was that he wouldn’t pursue a close call. A business had to grab him by the throat—and this the Blumkin business surely did. ([Location 4993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=4993))

- The purchase of the Furniture Mart, in 1983, put Buffett’s mill mistakes in stark relief. He finally (though obliquely) admitted in public that his devotion to Ben Graham had caused him, for too long, to stick with brick-and-mortar assets such as textiles at the cost of overlooking Mrs. B-style franchises.

His replacement, Garry Morrison, an M.B.A. with a degree in textiles, argued for an infusion of fresh capital. Buffett refused. And without new money, the mill, clearly, would continue to bleed. In 1985, Buffett shut it down. ([Location 5094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5094))

- Buffett pledged that his investment in Cap Cities would follow him to the grave—and, in fact, a bit beyond the grave. I get asked what happens if I get hit by a truck. I usually say I feel sorry for the truck. I have it arranged so that not a share of Berkshire Hathaway stock needs to be sold on my death and [so] the behavior will conform to the promises I have made.26 Buffett’s “promises” were designed to thwart any possible designs of a Perelman, Pickens, or Kravis. He not only gave Murphy and Burke the proxy power over his Cap Cities stock, he also gave Cap Cities the legal authority over Berkshire’s freedom to sell. Buffett wouldn’t even be free to change his mind. Buffett tried to rationalize this unusual setup on economic grounds. He made the point that Murphy would be able to focus on the business without worrying about a raid. But Buffett was personally, as well as professionally, motivated. Murphy, with whom Buffett spoke virtually every week, was a close friend. In this investment, the “personal equation” was just as important. Buffett remarked to an interviewer: I will be in Cap Cities as long as I live. It’s like if you have a kid that has problems—it’s not something we’re going to sell in five years. We’re partners in it.27 ([Location 5376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5376))
- One of the best young money managers thought Buffett had sort of lost it. “Warren has had three careers,” this investor-critic explained. “In the old days, he was a scavenger. He looked for value. Then it got hard to find stuff and he became a franchise investor; he bought great businesses at reasonable prices. And then he said, ‘I can no longer find good businesses at even acceptable prices, and I will take advantage of my size and teach the world a lesson about long-term investing.’ We think he screwed up. It’s stupid.” Buffett and Munger doubted that they could have done better trying to dance in and out.32 For one thing, a buy-and-hold investor put off the tax man—over time, a very big saving.‖ For another, their long-term approach created opportunities: a Mrs. B or Ralph Schey was more inclined to sell to an owner such as Buffett. And, knowing that divorce was not an option, ([Location 5416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5416))
- Buffett was a bit—quite a bit—more circumspect in choosing a partner. To the extent that he, or any investor, is not thinking about how and when he will get out, he will be more selective on the way in. As in a marriage, this is apt to lead to better results. But the reason for Buffett’s policy, “stupid” or not, was that selling left him hollow, whereas staying with “Murph” he found infinitely satisfying. As he expressed it to Business Week, selling a familiar stock was “like dumping your wife when she gets old.”33 This was a strong comment from a guy who, in fact, had refused to dump his wife after she had moved out on him. Buffett revisited this metaphor in one of his letters: here, selling a good stock was like marrying for money—a mistake in most cases, “insanity if one is already rich.”34 Buy-and-hold did have a financial logic, but at Buffett’s extreme it can only be seen, as he put it, as a “quirk” of character, appealing for “a mixture of personal and financial considerations.”35 He liked to keep things—stocks, “pals,” anything that lent a sense of permanence. To turn around and sell because someone offered “2× or 3×” was “kind of crazy.”36 Any other investor, such as his young critic, would have deemed that Buffett was the crazy one. But Buffett had always craved, and had always felt enriched by, continuity: to work with the same people, to own the same ([Location 5424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5424))
- stocks, to be in the same businesses. Hanging on was a metaphor for his life. Buffett carried his avoidance of debt to a similar—highly personal—extreme. In 1986, Exxon, which enjoyed a triple-A credit rating, had four times as much equity as debt. Berkshire had twenty-five times, a ratio that would have put a Puritan to sleep.37 But then, debt could lead to the supreme discontinuity, one perhaps more painful than “dumping your wife”—losing control of Berkshire. As Buffett explained in Phoenix, debt was the financial temptress, the fatal “weak link”: It’s a very sad thing. You can have somebody whose aggregate performance is terrific, but if they have a weakness, maybe it’s with… ([Location 5437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5437))
- One time, when Buffett was speaking off-the-cuff to a group at Cap Cities, he was asked what techniques he recommended to managers. He launched into a tale about a stranger in a small town. The fellow wanted to get acquainted with folks, so he went over to the village square and saw an old-timer with “kind of a mean-looking German shepherd.” Buffett continued: He looked at the dog a little tentatively and he said, “Does your dog bite?” The old-timer said, “Nope.” So the stranger reached down to pet him and the dog lunged at him and practically took off his arm, and the stranger as he was repairing his shredded coat turned to the old-timer and said, “I thought you said your dog doesn’t bite.” The guy says, “Ain’t my dog.”28 The moral for managers: It’s important to ask the right question.

- Buffett acknowledged that he had public and private personas—or, as he put it, that he was an introvert at home and an extrovert on the road.35 This division was mirrored, in a rough sense, by his two female companions.

- This ability of Buffett’s to cut through the clutter suggests a certain genius. Buffett focused so exquisitely on his object, and his simplicity was a counterpart to that genius.

- aphorism: “That which is not worth doing is not worth doing well.”)39 He did not like protracted decision-making or drawn-out and contentious bargaining.

- While his individual businesses racked up exceptional returns on capital, they grew at only modest rates, for which Buffett deserves some blame. He was chary of reinvesting in them, possibly because of his failure in textiles. Thus, World Book was slow to put out an electronic edition, and Borsheim’s ignored the opportunity to exploit its reputation by adding stores. Buffett did not rule out expansion; he ([Location 5794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5794))
- simply demanded that a Blumkin, a Lipsey, or a Schey convince him that said manager could do more by retaining a dollar of earnings than Buffett and Munger could do by investing it elsewhere. The manager who did not convince sent a dividend to Omaha. Buffett applied the same equation to himself at the corporate level. That is, if he and Munger could not find superior investments, it would be time for Berkshire to stop growing and to pay dividends to shareholders. ([Location 5798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5798))
- I have never met a man who could forecast the market. WARREN BUFFETT, ([Location 5807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5807))
- Buffett thought of everything in terms of odds: horse races, plane crashes, even nuclear war. Once, at a meeting of the Graham group, with twenty-five of his confreres, he bet Carol Loomis that at least two people in the room would have the same birthday.1 She was shocked when Buffett proved right. The simple (but surprising) explanation was that the mathematical odds of this occurring were 60 percent. Insurance, similarly, reduced all experience in life to mathematical probabilities. Buffett’s buddy and fellow insurance executive Jack Byrne never forgot when Buffett met him at the University Club in Washington with three mysterious dice, each with an unusual assortment of dots. Buffett made a proposition: Byrne could pick whichever die he wanted and Buffett would take one of the two that remained. Buffett assured him that if they then rolled twenty times, Buffett would win. “I got out my H-P calculator,” Byrne recalled. “I wasn’t going to be shown up in my own business. ([Location 5814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5814))
- I added up the probabilities. I picked one and Warren takes one of the ([Location 5822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5822))
- other two and wins fourteen times. Then he says, “You want to do it again—for lunch?” So this time, I pick the die that Warren won with. Now he wins sixteen times. So I go back to the H-P. He’s sitting there with a shit-eating grin on his face. For each die, one of the other two would always beat it. If you picked the right die and rolled enough times, you simply couldn’t lose. That was insurance: if you figured out the odds of a hurricane, or a three-car fatal, and priced your policies accordingly, you were playing with loaded dice. ([Location 5822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5822))
- Buffett had always been more involved in insurance than in his other entities, and had always known that—unlike, say, candy—insurance had the potential to grow off the charts. But in no other business had growth been accompanied by so many setbacks. In the 1970s, Berkshire had been burned by auto insurance fraud in Florida and disastrous levels of workers’ compensation claims in California. Its subsidiaries in Texas, Minnesota, and Iowa had been shut down altogether. And the growing tendency of juries to ladle out big awards had resulted in discomforting shocks. When Buffett met with his managers at National Indemnity, he would make a simple plea: “Tell me the bad news.”2 But despite their best efforts, his underwriters were repeatedly overly optimistic in estimating losses.3 ([Location 5827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5827))
- Berkshire’s favored (but not exclusive) niche was “reinsurance.” This in effect is a wholesale business. Instead of selling thousands of small policies to homeowners or drivers, the reinsurer sells a few very big policies to other insurance companies, thus assuming a portion of the risks that its customers have underwritten. It is typically a “long-tail” business, meaning that claims are slow to develop. Thus, a reinsurer can reinvest the “float” from premium payments over long periods, only at the end of which will its profit (or loss) be known. It is hardly surprising that many reinsurers err toward optimism. Buffett put it rather wittily: Initially, the morning mail brings lots of cash and few claims. This state of affairs can produce a blissful, almost euphoric, feeling akin to that experienced by an innocent upon receipt of his first credit card.6 ([Location 5847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5847))
- The perennial problem is competition. As Buffett noted, all it took to increase the “supply” of insurance (unlike that of physical commodities) was the willingness of a provider to sign its name.7 Therefore, when prices were high, new entrants rushed in. This led to frequent, cyclical bouts of price-cutting. The first half of the eighties was one such period, with woefully inadequate prices. Buffett’s response to the slump, though, was unlike anyone else’s. ([Location 5855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5855))

- hang on to market share, Buffett recognized this as betting against the odds. So he and Goldberg refused to play. From 1980 to 1984, they allowed their business to shrink from $185 million in premiums to $134 million. If the business was unprofitable, Buffett didn’t want the business. Someday—he wrote this in 1982—losses would force providers to pull back, and prices would rise. In the meantime, he would wait. It is natural to wonder why every insurer didn’t adopt such an approach. Their shareholders, and their managements, had been schooled on the principle of “steady” growth. To turn down business would violate the culture. At Berkshire, insurance operatives responded to a very different imperative. (In insurance, Berkshire did have a “culture.”) Constantine Iordanou, a division president in New York, said that when he wrote a policy, he was quite conscious that he was playing, as he put it, “with Warren’s checkbook.” This tended to inhibit Iordanou from betting against the odds. In 1985, the insurance market did turn. The industry suffered severe losses and insolvencies, and many companies cut back the coverage they offered. The ability to provide insurance, in Buffett’s phrase, is “an attitudinal concept, not a physical fact.”9 By 1985, both the “attitude” of insurers and their capital reserves were depressed, and prices soared. Buffett now reaped a double payoff for his prior conservatism. Big commercial customers realized that a promise from a potentially insolvent provider is no promise at all. There was a flight to quality, and Berkshire, which had six times as much as capital as the average carrier, had the soundest balance sheet of ([Location 5866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5866))
- any insurer in the country.10 Thus, just as prices became attractive, Berkshire was very much in demand. In mid-1985, Buffett took out a nervy advertisement inviting big commercial customers (who were hard pressed to find coverage) to submit policies for any type of risk with premiums of $1 million or more. There was a twist: respondents had to name their price. If Buffett (or Goldberg) deemed a proposal to be unreasonable, he would throw it out with the understanding that he would not grant a second chance. This poker ploy generated more than $100 million in premiums. The strong-get-stronger scenario was even more pronounced in reinsurance. With their losses mounting, conventional insurers were scrambling for protective cover. But reinsurers, too, had been burned by losses. Few were able to answer the call, and fewer still were willing. Having lost money when prices were low, they were fearful of writing coverage at any price. Buffett likened them to Mark Twain’s cat: “Having once sat on a hot stove, it never did so again—but it never again sat on a cold stove, either.”11 Berkshire was now in a position to write very big policies, thanks to its capital and to Buffett’s “attitude.” He was perfectly willing to risk losing large amounts of money, even as much as $10 million on a single event such as a fire or… ([Location 5879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5879))
- the following year. By 1987, Berkshire was stuffed with cash. However, it was far from clear what Buffett would do with it. He would “rather buy a good stock than a good jet,”14 he quipped, but he could not find one that was cheap enough. The bull market was in its heyday. In the spring, when Berkshire staged its annual meeting, the Dow was at an eye-opening 2,258 (and Berkshire at $3,450 a share). Buffett had quietly sold every stock in the portfolio save for the “permanent” three: Cap Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post. But he was stumped for a place to reinvest. Buffett mistrusted forecasts—as he reminded shareholders, Ben Graham had been bearish when the Dow was at 400. But Buffett could not suppress his pessimism; in response to a question, he said he would not be surprised if the market—then at a precarious twenty times earnings—fell 50 percent. Share prices had lately been rising at a far, far faster clip than the 12 to 13 percent equity “coupon” that companies were actually earning. To Buffett, this suggested “a danger zone.” A shareholder with a long memory asked if the climate resembled that of 1969, when Buffett had folded Buffett Partnership.… ([Location 5895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=5895))
- On about October 12, Buffett cashed out the stock portfolio of at least one of Berkshire’s profit-sharing plans. It cleaned the larder of stocks, save for his permanent three. According to a Buffett associate, “It was a clear edict: ‘Sell everything.’ ” Buffett was not making a forecast; he was merely obeying two cherished rules. Rule No. 1: “Never lose money.” Rule No. 2: “Never forget Rule No. 1.” Munger said, “Warren would never claim that he could call the market.” But perhaps Buffett had been glancing a bit more anxiously at the newspaper clipping on his wall—the one from 1929. In the week following, interest rates climbed above 10 percent. Japanese shares continued to rise, but now no one on Wall Street cared about Japan. On Friday, October 16, the Dow plunged 108 points.

- Ben Graham had likened the behavior of stocks to that of a kindly but fickle fellow named Mr. Market. Now manic, now depressive, Mr. Market’s next quotation was anybody’s guess. The trick for the investor was to ignore his unpredictable mood changes. But on October 19, 1987, investors had fallen dumbly under his spell, selling stocks—any stocks—tick for miserable tick. This proved to Buffett what he had already known—that Graham had been abandoned. He had been shelved for academic ([Location 6083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6083))
- witch doctors” who peddled “arcane formulae” and “techniques shrouded in mystery.” Though “Ben’s allegory” was a fitting-as-ever prophylactic against the “super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace,” scarcely a business school in the country used Graham’s texts. Instead of price and value, Buffett lamented in a postmortem, “professionals and academicians talk of efficient markets, dynamic hedging and betas.”1 ([Location 6086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6086))
- The premise of Buffett’s career was that stockpicking, though difficult and subjective, was susceptible to reasoned analysis. Occasionally, certain stocks sold for far less than they were “worth.” An astute investor could profit by buying them. In place of that rather modest maxim, scholars had substituted a seductively simple but unifying design, the Efficient Market Theory. In a nutshell, the theory said that at any moment, all the publicly available information about a company was reflected in the price of its stock. Whenever news about a stock became public, traders pounced, buying or selling until its price reached ([Location 6095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6095))
- equilibrium. Underlying this truism was an assumption that the old price had been as “wise” as traders could make it. Therefore, the new price—and each succeeding new price—would be wise as well. The traders merely did the work of Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand. Since everything worth knowing about a company was already in the price, most security analysis was, to cite a popular text, “logically incomplete and valueless.”2 The future course of a stock would depend on new (as yet unknowable) information. A stock, then, was unpredictable; it followed a “random walk.” If markets were random, investing was a game of chance. Buffett, then, was a lucky investor but not a skillful one, just as the person who repeatedly got heads when flipping a coin was a lucky—not a skillful-flipper. This challenged nothing less than the validity of Buffett’s career. Buffett’s record also posed a challenge, for it was the inconvenient fact that failed to follow the form. Buffett would taunt the scholars with the evidence of his career, and implicit in his taunts was a simple question: “If you’re so smart, how come I’m so rich?” Nonetheless, at business schools and economics departments, the Efficient Market Theory acquired the power of sacrament. Its truths were regarded as absolute, whereas competing doctrines were virtually banned. The theory also permeated Wall Street, as well as the investing culture as received in financial talk shows and advice columns. It is, indeed, the intellectual basis for the eggs-in-a-thousand-baskets approach of extreme “diversification,” which is the prevailing bias of most investors ([Location 6099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6099))
- today. The theory fermented at various sites, but from similar yeasts, during the 1950s and 1960s. Among the pioneers was Paul A. Samuelson, the popular Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and textbook writer. Samuelson was a Keynesian, but where the sardonic Lord Keynes viewed the stock exchange as a casino, Samuelson put faith in market prices. Around 1950, Samuelson subscribed to a tip sheet that charged $125 a year. He soon decided, logically enough, that if the tout service had really “known,” it would have charged far more than $125 or kept its tips to itself.3 This was a forerunner of the Efficient Market Theorist’s joke in which two economists, walking across a campus, spot a $10 bill on the ground. As one bends to retrieve it, the other says, “Don’t bother. If it were really worth $10, it wouldn’t be there.” Samuelson’s landmark “Proof That Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly,” published in 1965, adorned this notion in scholarly cloth. His intriguing gambit was that future events “cast their shadows before them”—that is, they are reflected in current prices. If one could be sure that a price will rise, it would have already risen.… You never get something for nothing.4 Two years later, Samuelson appeared before the… ([Location 6113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6113))
- value,” buying bargain stocks and selling dear ones and, in the process, eliminating such opportunities even as they arose.5 The funds’ records were such that they could have done as well throwing darts. John Sparkman, the committee chairman, was stunned. Did Samuelson say darts? MR. SAMUELSON: What my report says is that the median fund having access to this high-paid management has, in fact, done just as well and no better than twenty random stocks selected from the stock market. THE CHAIRMAN: When you say twenty random stocks, are you referring to stocks that you just close your eyes and reach down and touch? MR. SAMUELSON: Yes. Precisely. THE CHAIRMAN: Or is some expert economist such as you picking them? MR. SAMUELSON: No. Random. When I say “random,” I want you to think of dice or think of random numbers or a dart. The professor, however, did not advocate using darts to pick investments. For one thing, he knew, the Efficient Market Theory had some problems. Stock prices were far more volatile than the expected cash flows of the underlying companies, of which they were, in theory, a mirror. And Samuelson was corresponding with Conrad Taff, the Graham student and early Buffett devotee, who insisted that the theory was bunk. Buffett, who actually had a dartboard in his office for a while,6 was beating the darts every year, Taff would tell him. Samuelson was intrigued, and gradually became a “Warren watcher,”7 the first of many Efficient Market Theorists who puzzled over Buffett rather as an astronomer might wonder about a mysterious star. But Samuelson did not change his mind. Part of the theory’s allure was that it extended the classical economics of Adam Smith to financial markets. Investors such as Buffett thought of intrinsic value as an inherent quality; it lay “behind, or beneath, the prices observed in the marketplace.”8 The prices themselves were approximations. But to a classicist, the Invisible Hand was perpetually driving market prices and value together. In the extreme view, value only emerged—in a sense, only existed—at the point when buyer and seller agreed on a price. If IBM was trading at $120 a share, then IBM was “worth” $120; it could not be more or less. Of course, this implied that the buyer and seller were acting rationally. Buffett’s view, of companies and of human behavior, was more circumspect. In the first place, value was… ([Location 6127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6127))

- that investors with superior records must have had inside dope, or at least dope that was not widely known. Thus, the theory was intact: not even a perfect market could be expected to digest information before it was public. Indeed, the Economist, which reported each twist and turn of the theorists as received wisdom, asserted that stockpicking smarts were “either rare or nonexistent,” although, the magazine sneered, “it helps to have the kind of inside smartness that Ivan Boesky had.”11 Samuelson was explicit: In the same way, experience has persuaded me that there are a few Warren Buffetts out there with high rent-earning ability because they are good at figuring out which fundamentals are fundamental and which new data are worth paying high costs to get. Such super-stars don’t come cheap: by the time you spot them their fee has been bid sky high!12 As Samuelson knew, Buffett did not charge a fee. In any event, Buffett got his “data” chiefly from annual reports, which were available to anyone. By ignoring this, Samuelson could attribute Buffett’s success to information-gathering, and thus avoid the issue of whether Buffett might have a talent for analyzing the “data.” It was as if he were merely a good librarian. But Samuelson, a Nobel laureate in economics, knew he was more than that. At some point after his Senate testimony, Samuelson bought a… ([Location 6170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6170))
- I remain convinced that no investment funds, no matter for what kind of new activity or area, can claim demonstrable superior talent. Luck, Yes. But Superior Talent, No.… No, it’s a world in which all reliably predictable events are priced right, with only surprise left. And surprise is “random” by definition.14 But Alchian devoted considerable energy to explaining Buffett’s results. Ultimately, he decided that the secret lay in a wrinkle in Nebraska insurance law that, according to Alchian, permitted Nebraska insurers to take a greater role in monitoring their investments than out-of-state insurers. I attribute his success entirely to that fortunate, happenstance position, and not to any superior (relative to his competitors) skills. It is difficult not to marvel at Alchian’s leap of faith. Samuelson at least allowed that “Warren may be as near to a genius at investing as I have observed.”15 Yet that was also a sort of damnation. Genius was not method—and Samuelson disclaimed his method. “Warren gave a talk and said, ‘Any fool could see that the Washington Post was under priced,’ ” Samuelson noted. “I’m not a fool. I don’t find it credible.” Why, then, had Buffett bought the Post? Samuelson replied, “That’s the… ([Location 6186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6186))
- Malkiel saw no evidence of “competence” beyond that of coin-flippers able to disguise their luck as talent. “God Almighty,” Malkiel proclaimed, “does not know the proper price-earnings multiple for a common stock.”25 This fetching comment introduced a straw man. Graham-and-Dodders did not claim to know the proper price for a stock. Theirs was a rough science, at best. What they said was that on occasion a stock was so out of line that one could leap in without any claim to precision. Such instances might be rare. Graham-and-Dodd investors typically owned only a dozen or so stocks from among the thousands available. But those few could make one rich. Quoting Buffett: Observing correctly that the market was frequently efficient, [EMT adherents] went on to conclude incorrectly that it was always efficient. The difference between these propositions is night and day.26 One striking contrast was in the rival camps’ definition of “risk.” Risk, to Buffett, was the risk of paying more than a business would prove to be worth. And the range of variables was ([Location 6253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6253))
- nearly infinite. Was a company dependent on too few customers? Did the chairman drink? Since the sum (or even the number) of such risks could not be figured with precision, Buffett looked for companies—the very few companies—in which the risks seemed tolerable even allowing for error. The theorists recognized no such nuances; risk, in their view, was measurable. Since stock prices were right, they simply assumed that the foreseeable risks in a business were incorporated in its price. Every change in outlook was immediately matched by a change in price. Therefore, the best proxy for the “riskiness” of an investment was the historical riskiness of its stock. Risk, then, equaled price volatility. It was defined in precise mathematical terms, as the degree to which a stock had bounced around, relative to each bounce of the market as a whole. As if to sanctify its algebraic properties, it was christened with a Greek letter, beta. A stock with a beta of 1.0 bounced around as much as the general market; one with a beta of 1.2 was quantifiably more volatile, and one with a beta of 1.5 more volatile still. The theorists’ logic now proceeded on a dizzying spiral. Investors did not like risk. Therefore, the investors who bought high-beta stocks, being ever-rational, must have done so because such stocks held the prospect of above-average returns—indeed, with returns that would exceed the norm in precise arithmetic relation to their betas. Conversely, investors in lower-beta stocks would “pay” for the past tranquillity of such issues by accepting lower returns. Indeed, since there could be no free lunch, the only way to consistently earn a higher profit was by accepting ([Location 6263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6263))
- added “risk”—that is, higher betas.27 Now the totemic nature of modern finance begins to emerge. The only factor necessary to calculate the expected relative return on a stock was its beta. Nothing about the fundamentals of a company mattered; the one number, beta, computed from past stock prices, was the only relevant issue. “What is your beta?” the scholars asked. It was like a mantra. And Wall Street analysts slavishly paid heed. Virtually every brokerage in the country required its analysts to assess their stocks in terms of “betas” and of “risk-adjusted”—meaning “beta-adjusted”—returns. To Graham,28 and to Buffett, this was a madness. That a stock bounced around did not make it risky to a long-term holder. In fact, beta turned “risk” on its head. Consider that when Buffett invested in the Washington Post, the market was valuing the Post at about $80 million. Had the stock fallen by half before his purchase, it would have been more volatile—and hence, to an Efficient Market Theorist, “riskier.” Buffett tartly observed, “I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to buy something at $40 million than at $80 million.”29 Columbia Business School brought the two sides face to face in 1984, the fiftieth anniversary of Graham and Dodd’s textbook. Buffett was asked to speak on behalf of… ([Location 6276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6276))
- as a fact of life, and a scholar who purports to model behavior in a manner which violates it faces a difficult task of justification.”31 Since Jensen’s encyclical, the theory, and particularly the concept of beta, had come under attack. Now, at Columbia, Uris Hall was stacked with Buffett’s fellow investors. Surveying the crowd, Jensen adopted a gracious tone. He felt “like a turkey must feel at the beginning of a turkey hunt.” But the turkey was hard to pin down. First, Jensen made an absolutist claim: no profit could be systematically earned from analyzing public information. Then he gave some ground. Exceptions had popped up; he seemed to grant that a superior analyst might exist. Still, he ridiculed the profession in general. People consulted security analysts, like priests, owing to their “psychic demand for answers.” When science responds by saying there is no known answer, or worse yet, there is no answer, people are not satisfied.… In such circumstances people are perfectly willing to make up answers, or even to pay others to make them up for then.32 Security analysts, then, were the spiritual descendants of “the medicine man, mystics, astrologers, gurus.” As opposed to these pagan stockpickers, Jensen claimed for “science” the Efficient Market Theory. Noting that the “star pupils of Graham and Dodd” were in… ([Location 6292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6292))
- Buffett could not have asked for a better setup. The failure of most money managers to do better than coin-flippers had been invoked at every turn. But on reflection, there was less to this than met the eye. Since pros accounted for most of the trading, the average stockpicker could not do better than average. The meaningful question was, were there enough gaps in the market’s efficiency so that some preidentifiable group could beat the market, and beat it consistently? Borrowing from Jensen, Buffett envisioned a “national coin-flipping contest.” Each day, everyone in the United States flipped a coin, with those who flipped tails continually dropping out. After twenty days, only 215 flippers would be left. Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.… But then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same.…33 But what if the surviving orangutans largely came from the “same zoo,” located, conveniently, in Omaha? One would suspect that the zookeeper had something to do with it.

- extended period. And each had been preidentified as a Graham-and-Dodder; that is, each had spent his career looking for discrepancies between market price and intrinsic value. None had paid attention to whether stocks did better on Monday or Thursday, or in January or August. Buffett found it “extraordinary” that academics studied such things. They studied what was measurable, rather than what was meaningful. “As a friend [Charlie Munger] said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Buffett seemed especially resentful about the theory’s hold on his alma mater. He was willing to give a lecture at Columbia, and did so every year or two, but refused to donate money to it. John C. Burton, the business school dean, said, “He told me very frankly he didn’t think education was enhanced by money and secondly that he didn’t think business schools were teaching the things he wanted to support. He was very hostile to the idea of efficient market research.” Burton, who owned a few shares of Berkshire, thought Buffett’s reason was genuine, but incredibly myopic. Buffett often cited his personal debt to Graham, yet when Burton pressed him to give something back—to endow, perchance, future Grahams and future Buffetts—the billionaire would turn him down.

- The introduction, in the 1980s, of stock-index futures marked the theory’s coming-of-age. Academics had preached that investors could not pick stocks. Now they needn’t try; they could heave a single dart at the entire market. Buffett urged Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, in 1982, not to permit such futures. “We do not need more people gambling in nonessential instruments identified with the stock market,” Buffett wrote.36 In a prophetic ([Location 6345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6345))
- aside, he warned that futures could lead to speculative excesses and sour the public on stocks altogether. It is easy to lose sight of the distinction between “futures” and stocks—after all, are they not both investments? This is arguable. Futures are zero-sum bets on the market direction. They do not raise capital for business, which is the essential purpose of the stock market. They do not represent a stake in a business—merely a stake in a wager. In the eighties, money poured into futures as well as into “index funds” designed to mimic the market averages (by owning every stock or a reasonable proxy). Money managers were giving up investing for trading the market whole—thus abandoning the job assigned them by markets, which is to keep prices “right” by searching out bargains and winnowing out the overpriced. By 1986, well over $100 billion was managed “passively,” meaning it was not managed at all. It was chained to the Ouija board of various market indices. In the summer of 1986, there were, finally, cries that the trend had gone too far. The occasion was a then-shocking 62-point drop in the Dow. Perhaps too many people had been looking at Ouija boards? Burton Malkiel, writing in the Wall Street Journal, demurred. If markets were efficient, automaton investing was a cause for celebration.  … I am proud to have been at least partly responsible [for] a growing faith in the efficiency of stock markets and a trend toward passive portfolio management.37 Buffett countered in the Washington Post, arguing that new-age trading was fulfilling Keynes’s dark prophecy of the market as a ([Location 6349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6349))
- casino. Speculation had so overwhelmed markets that their proper, value-discovering role was being swamped by hyperactive trading. The new, esoteric instruments were not “investments”; they served no social agenda; they did the work not of the Invisible Hand but of “an invisible foot kicking society in the shins.” Now Buffett trotted out a rather savage satire; he fantasized that a boat of twenty-five brokers were shipwrecked and forced to live out their days on an uninhabited island. Faced with developing an economy that would maximize their consumption and pleasure, would they, I wonder, assign 20 of their number to produce food, clothing, shelter, etc., while setting five to endlessly trading options on the future output of the 20?38 As a remedy for the “casino society,” Buffett proposed what Jonathan Swift would have called “a modest tax”: 100 percent of the profits on stocks and futures held for less than a year. This idea disappeared without a trace. But fears about hyperactive trading did not. In 1987, with markets restless, worries of a meltdown escalated. Malkiel, writing in the New York Times, again defended push-button trading as fostering “liquidity.” Alluding to the market’s jumpiness, he added, “but the market only seems more volatile because of a scale effect.”39 His timing was off; three weeks later, the market crashed.

- In a narrow sense, the persistence of the theory was a boon to Buffett’s career. Thousands of his potential competitors were taught that studying securities was a waste of time. “From a selfish point of view,” Buffett wrote after the crash, “Grahamites should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual teaching of EMT.”46 But Buffett would have preferred that schools perpetuate the teaching of Buffett. In academia, he was still an “anomaly,” a “red herring,” a “three-sigma” irrelevancy. “No one,” he wrote of the theory’s proponents, has ever said he was wrong, no matter how many thousands of students he has sent forth misinstructed. EMT, moreover, continues to be an integral part of the investment curriculum at major business schools.47 And Buffett was not. But in the aftermath of Black Monday, Buffett was to give his most convincing lesson ever. ([Location 6407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6407))
- But what had inspired Buffett to become the biggest single owner of Coca-Cola just before its surge? What had inspired him to invest more—much, much more—in Coca-Cola than in any previous stock? Was it just a lucky dart? Or was it, as Buffett maintained, as close to a sure thing as he had ever seen?7 Many of his previous investments had hinged on specific events, or on values that could be tabulated from a balance sheet. The Washington Post had been selling for a mere fraction of its liquidation value, while GEICO, acquired for next to nothing, had been an absolute steal if one was convinced that the then troubled company would survive. Coca-Cola was different. Buffett couldn’t derive its value from the balance sheet. He couldn’t compute the value. But he could see it. He was often asked, how did he determine the “value” of a stock? Conceptually, Buffett likened it to that of a bond. A bond’s value was equal to the cash flow from future interest payments, discounted back to the present. A stock’s value was figured the same way; it equaled the anticipated cash flow per share,* except that the investor had to fill in a crucial detail: If you buy a bond, you know exactly what’s going to happen, assuming it’s a good bond, a U.S. Government bond. If it says 9 percent, you know what the coupons are going to be for maybe thirty years.… Now, when you buy a business, you’re buying something with coupons on it, too, except, the only problem is, they don’t print in the amount. And it’s my job to print in [to figure out] the amount on the coupon. ([Location 6442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6442))
- With this notion of value in mind, Buffett tried to find stocks whose “value” was greater—significantly greater—than their price. Buffett’s guides to finding such a stock could be summarized quickly: • Pay no attention to macroeconomic trends or forecasts, or to people’s predictions about the future course of stock prices. Focus on long-term business value—on the size of the coupons down the road. • Stick to stocks within one’s “circle of competence.” For Buffett, that was often a company with a consumer franchise. But the general rule was true for all: if you didn’t understand the business—be it a newspaper or a software firm—you couldn’t value the stock. • Look for managers who treated the shareholders’ capital with ownerlike care and thoughtfulness. • Study prospects—and their competitors—in great detail. Look at raw data, not analysts’ summaries. Trust your own eyes, Buffett said. But one needn’t value a business too precisely. A basketball coach doesn’t check to see if a prospect is six foot one or six foot two; he looks for seven-footers. • The vast majority of stocks would not be compelling either way—so ignore them. Merrill Lynch had an opinion on every stock; Buffett did not. But when an investor had conviction about a stock, he or she should also show courage—and buy a ton of it. ([Location 6456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6456))
- Buffett kept insisting that he had no mysterious shortcut, no crystal ball. Once, a broker who was buying a house asked for his outlook on interest rates. Buffett jokingly replied, “Only two people understand that. Both of them live in Switzerland. However, they’re diametrically opposed to each other.”38 Most of what Buffett did, such as reading reports and trade journals, the small investor could also do. He felt very deeply that the common wisdom was dead wrong; the little guy could invest in the market, so long as he stuck to his Graham-and-Dodd knitting.39 But people, he found, either took to this approach immediately or they never did. Many had a “perverse” need to make it complicated.40 This truism extended to Buffett’s family. His elder sister Doris once tried to juice up her income by selling “naked options”—precisely the sort of market roulette that Buffett had scorned. Come Black Monday, Doris, who rather liked living on the edge, found herself $1.4 million in debt.41 Warren agreed to reorganize a family trust that he administered for Doris, so that she would now get a monthly stipend from it. But he flatly refused to pay off the debt—leaving Doris no choice but to default. She was badly hurt by Warren’s refusal, and he was hurt by her subsequent spell of coolness. But bailing out a speculator went against his grain—and Warren would not break his rules, not even for his sister.

- His familial relationships, he felt, would be “cleaner” without the distorting element of financial dependency. Most of all, he wanted his grown children to lead normal, independent lives. This forced him, at least as he saw matters, virtually to cut them off from financial support. He was so wary of spoiling his likable kids with “food stamps” that he refused them even the dollop of financial help that children of moderately wealthy parents receive as a matter of course. His attitude baffled his millionaire friends (save for Munger, who came close to agreeing with him). When the Graham group debated what was the “right amount” to leave to one’s children, Buffett said a few hundred thousand ought to do it.2 Larry Tisch protested, “Warren, that’s wrong. If they aren’t spoiled by age twelve, they won’t be spoiled.” As Kay Graham, who was grooming her son to take over the Post, recalled, “That was the one thing we [Buffett and she] argued about.” Buffett did care very deeply about his kids. Moreover, he was a tolerant, in some respects an enlightened, father. He encouraged his kids to follow their stars, and he was patient when one of them suffered a disappointment—in a career, for instance, or in a marriage. But where money was involved he was impersonal and at arm’s length, as though his kids were merely junior financial ([Location 6654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6654))
- partners. There was a good deal of sanity in his approach—a billionaire should set limits—but Buffett, as in his professional life, was blind to any middle ground. When Susie needed $20 to park at the airport, she had to write her father a check. When Buffett gave his kids a loan, they had to sign a loan agreement, so that it would be plain, in black and white, that they were legally on the hook to him.3 Many Berkshire holders gave substantial gifts of stock to their kids—but not Buffett. He simply gave $10,000—the tax-deductible limit—to each child and to any of their spouses at Christmas. Such restraint sent them a message, just as giving them millions would have. When the kids were toddlers, Buffett had written to Jerry Orans that he wanted to defer any largesse at least until he could see “what the tree has produced.” In young adulthood, Susie, Howie, and Peter must have grasped that their father still viewed his saplings as unfinished. Philosophically, they defended his approach, and with considerable pride. But they also wondered, as Howie put it, why he couldn’t “lighten up,” and at times seemed to resent his unsubtle efforts to motivate them. The Buffett kids had open, direct manners that put one in mind of their father (none drank anything stronger than Coke). They also had his eagerness, but were slow bloomers. Each dropped out of college, and each entered into an early, ill-fated marriage. Financially, they had inherited a grubstake from Warren’s father, which Warren had invested for them in Berkshire. Thus they ([Location 6665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6665))
- could have been millionaires without working a day. Susie, alas, sold some stock (when it was under $1,000 a share) to buy a Porsche. After her marriage dissolved, she moved to Washington. There she made contact with Kay Graham, who took it upon herself to help her get an administrative job at The New Republic.4 In 1983, Susie remarried, to Allen Greenberg, a public-interest lawyer and future congressional aide. Warren and his wife were ecstatic about Greenberg, a wry, mild-mannered sort, whom they referred to as “Allen-the-perfect-son-in-law.”5 By the time the Greenbergs moved into a townhouse near Dupont Circle, Susie had used up her Berkshire. The young couple rented out part of their home and had just a tiny kitchen—very tiny. When Susie became pregnant, she wanted a larger kitchen for when the baby came—something she could fit a table into, with a door to the backyard. She had plans drawn up and got an estimate of $30,000. Knowing that her father wouldn’t spring for it, she asked him for a loan, at prevailing interest rates. Warren turned her down. “Why not go to the bank and take a loan out like everyone else?” he suggested. They had a long discussion, in which Warren explained that if he were the quarterback of the Nebraska football team it wouldn’t be fair of him to… ([Location 6677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6677))
- the time bedridden. “Mrs. Graham”—an ally—would come to dinner with her cook in tow, ferrying glazed monkfish and poached peaches up the steps to Susie’s bedroom. Noticing that Susie had only a small black-and-white television in the room, Graham suggested that she get a bigger, color set—and was horrified to learn that Buffett’s daughter couldn’t afford one. Warren, after all, had a large-screen TV in his house. Graham promptly called Warren, and this time he relented and bought Susie a proper TV.7 Still, Graham had had to shame him into it. Perhaps because money was the pivotal motivator in his life, Buffett acted as though money were a similarly pervasive and overriding focal point for others. He seemed to think that Susie would see a new television in terms of dollar signs (as he would), or that such a gift could somehow mar his daughter’s open and unspoiled character. To her, it was just a TV. But Susie deeply admired her father and probably had the easiest time accepting him. Dark-haired and vibrant, she recounted the saga of her kitchen as consistent with everything she knew of him. “He has a flat-out thing,” she said, as if to explain him. “He just doesn’t give us money.” For Howie, living up to his father was more of a struggle. He had an open-collared, sneakered informality that recalled his dad, but there was a flaw in the… ([Location 6692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6692))
- estate. As an aside, he rented some land and planted crops. As Warren knew, what Howie really wanted was a farm. After “torturing” himself, as a friend put it, Warren made what for him was a truly generous proposal. He offered to buy a farm and rent it to Howie on standard commercial terms (Howie would have to fork over a percentage of his farm income and pay the taxes). Howie asked his mother why Warren was getting involved. “Don’t ask,” Susie advised. “Just get the farm.” But that was not so easy. Warren announced a ceiling to what he would pay for a farm, depending on its potential income. Howie went to farm after farm, making bids “of insulting proportion.” When he’d seen about one hundred of them, he began to despair of getting one, but Warren refused to bend on the price. Finally, in 1985, they bought a farm for about $300,000 in Tekamah, Nebraska, forty-five minutes north of Omaha. “It was a typical Warren Buffett purchase,” Howie observed. “We bought it at the absolute bottom of the market. I think part of his motivation was to teach me a little about negotiation.” Howie didn’t even have a telephone at the farm, but it was a joyful refuge for him. He would go out in the spring and fall, often taking his family, working columns of corn and soybeans with a John Deere tractor.… ([Location 6705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6705))
- buy the farm, he couldn’t give Howie the fatherly recognition that he craved in other than financial terms. He could look at Howie’s books, but not at his crops—which is what Howie cared about. To Warren, it was just a business. Inasmuch as corn and soybeans are commodities, Warren was blunt about the farm’s being not a very good business at that, sardonically observing, “No one goes to the supermarket to buy Howie Buffett’s corn.”8 Warren did use the farm to “teach” Howie something; he agreed to lower his rent for any year in which Howie got his weight below a specified ceiling. (Warren was obsessed with staying slim, which he associated with longevity. He made similar “weight deals” for money with his wife and daughter.) In most years, this blatant attempt to manipulate Howie’s weight with financial plums failed.9 Warren was more helpful when Howie turned to him for guidance, as he often did. After he got the farm, Howie decided to run for election as a county commissioner (as a Republican, like Warren’s father). Howie was worried that Warren would be seen either as trying to buy the election or—what would be worse—as not supporting him at all. Warren defused this concern by declaring that he would simply contribute 10 percent of whatever Howie raised elsewhere—and Howie won. Their relationship improved… ([Location 6719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6719))
- became a jet-setting executive. Warren bragged to a friend that Howie was “making more” than Warren was, which was his way of showing pride in Howie.11 Seeing his kids succeed on their own “was a real issue with him,” Howie observed—just as getting approval from Warren was a real issue for Howie. Warren’s younger son acknowledged this openly. Peter had quit Stanford to start a sound studio and, ignoring his father’s sage advice, had sold his Berkshire to buy a $30,000 twenty-four-track tape recorder. He soon realized that he did not have the income to justify it, but he and his wife slowly built a music-production company, Independent Sound, in San Francisco. Later, they moved to Milwaukee. Though mostly a jingle producer, Peter scored the fire-dance scene for the movie Dances with Wolves and recorded several well-received albums of New Age music. On a wintry Milwaukee morning, Peter ducked out of a soundproof glass studio, where two musicians were cutting a commercial, and began to talk about his father. He recounted one rather clumsy attempt by Warren to influence him. Warren had invited Peter to the Alfalfa Club, a very exclusive annual dinner in Washington, but stipulated that Peter cut his ponytail. Peter said no thanks. “He likes to have strings attached,” Peter observed. In recent… ([Location 6733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6733))
- added, the ponytail neatly tucked in a rubber band. “It’s so nice to say I’ve gotten to this point without it.” But a moment later, he said he regretted that his father had not told him—or perhaps that he had not heard his father say—that he could have simply borrowed against his Berkshire and held on to it. Peter had an unassuming, even inquisitive, manner—as if he, too, were curious about Warren’s character. He was extremely proud of his father’s accomplishments and moral standards. He recalled that Warren had once told him, “Someday you’re going to have to tell your dad to go to hell.” Establishing himself in a new city and selling his Berkshire were part of that, he said. Had Warren ever told his father to go to hell? Peter acknowledged that he didn’t know. Peter got to know his father better as he had success as a musician. When he played the piano with a fifteen-piece band, before an audience of seven hundred, in Milwaukee, Warren attended and praised him profusely. At one point, he told his son, “We do the same thing”—to Peter, an overwhelming tribute. By the late eighties or so, Peter, who as a boy had purchased The Father’s Handbook for his remote-seeming dad, felt that Warren and he had finally learned how to talk to each other.

- Warren’s renewal with his family may have stemmed in part from a gradual healing with his wife. He had heard more, from Susie directly, about her reasons for leaving him. They had an understanding and a greater openness. As Tom Rogers, a close nephew, put it, the Buffetts didn’t have to “try anything in their relationship. They are each other’s alter ego. Aunt Susie is as much able to cut emotion out of a decision as he is.”12 Warren was in constant contact with his wife. He saw her often, and with as much affection as ever. After an evening at Tom Murphy’s home in Westchester County, when the Buffetts shared a limousine with Stan Lipsey back to Manhattan, the two sat quietly in the back, holding hands the entire way. Susie told a mutual friend it had “worked out great,” meaning that Warren had gotten what he wanted—to stay married to Susie.13 Even now, years after Susie had moved out, she was the one—the only—person in the world he fully trusted. In 1987, Warren took a big step toward the family by offering Allen Greenberg, his son-in-law, the job of managing the Buffett Foundation. As usual, the… ([Location 6762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6762))
- organize his social schedule. She was there for him. As Warren was paying his son-in-law only $49,846 a year, young Susie’s life was no different from those of other Omaha mothers juggling young children and civic involvements. The author happened to visit on a day when her son had chicken pox. Susie was bathing him; she had no nurse or nanny. Ironically, Susie was always fending off fund-raisers who were under the mistaken notion that she had the keys to the fortune. One time, when Warren was escorting the billionaire Wunderkind of Microsoft, William Gates, through the Borsheim’s jewelry store, they noticed a box in the corner labeled “Buffett Lay-Away.” When Warren asked what it was, an employee sheepishly confessed that Susie had asked them to save a string of pearls, which she was buying on installment. As a birthday gift, Buffett paid off the balance. It began to dawn on him that spending money—particularly at Borsheim’s—could be fun. Another time, he remarked, as if discovering the wheel, “Gee, Suz, women really like jewelry.” With Susie around, Warren had a greater sense of extended family. Susie often dropped her kids off at Warren’s for Astrid to look after, which tended to knit Astrid into the Buffett family. In fact, Susie even urged Astrid to redo Warren’s house, which still had the sunshiny (but now faded) look given it… ([Location 6774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6774))
- and Astrid.”)15 The younger Susie, and her kids, were around Warren a lot. They seemed to humanize him. He would come to the Greenbergs in a worn jogging suit, get down on the floor, and play with the grandkids. At dinner, he would listen to the family chatter with a distracted look, pursing his lips, bobbing his chin, occasionally inserting a wisecrack, and salting (and resalting, after every bite) his hamburger. He told Kay Graham that Susie’s return to Omaha had changed his life.16 He even gave her a ruby bracelet—for Warren, hardly a casual gesture. In a sign that he was becoming comfortable with “what the tree produced,” he made his daughter a director of the Buffett Foundation and modestly relaxed his inheritance policy. The kids would get something—maybe three million or so apiece.17 (He didn’t tell the children how much.) Whatever the figure, it would not allow Susie, Howie, and Peter to lead the despised life of the “superrich.”18 Wholly apart from its effect on his kids’ lives, he simply didn’t think they were entitled to vast amounts of money. It would confer too much power, which in his view belonged to the public. “The idea that you get a lifetime supply of food stamps based on coming out of the right womb strikes at my idea of fairness,” he said.19 Ultimately, the claim… ([Location 6787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6787))

- As pragmatic as this view was, it is striking that both of Buffett’s “causes” were aimed at alleviating or preventing future sources of grief, such as a future war or a future oversupply of people. Virtually none of his immense resources went to help people who were already born-people who were here and now poor, sick, living in urban blight, illiterate; or people raising money for here-and-now concert halls, museums, universities, and hospitals (save for endowments of abortion or family planning programs).* Buffett’s almost exclusive focus on such macroeconomic, futuristic issues gave his philanthropy a ([Location 6868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6868))
- detached—almost a dehumanized—quality. Traditional charities would have “spent” his money. On the other hand, giving to population control could be construed as “investing”—sort of a global share buyback—because it would reduce the number of future divisors clamoring for the social pie. Charlie Munger, who was equally Malthusian, articulated this mind-set at a party for Keith Russell, a doctor who had been a Munger-Buffett ally in the Belous abortion rights case in California. After some of Russell’s patients presented a toast to the many babies he had delivered, Munger rose, glass held high, and solemnly declared, “I want to toast Dr. Russell for the thousands of babies he didn’t deliver.”32 ([Location 6873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6873))
- Given such a liberal outlook, people could not understand why Buffett didn’t do more. Munger, who shared his skepticism of philanthropies, was a generous giver and got heavily involved in his hospital as well as in a private school. But Buffett refused to be enlisted. Norman Lear once asked Buffett to make a brief introduction at an award ceremony for a group called Business Enterprise Trust. Buffett contributed to the group, which honors socially responsible businesspeople, and he was planning to be there in any case. But he flatly refused to make a presentation, saying he got fifty such requests a month. Lear was dismayed. He added, disbelievingly, “It’s twelve steps to the podium for a thirty-second introduction.” From Buffett’s viewpoint, everybody wanted a piece of him, like camera-toting tourists pursuing a colorful native. His defense, as Kay Graham recognized, was to set his own agenda, in philanthrophy as in so much else. Holding on to his money was a way of keeping control. Even as a boy, when he hadn’t owned a part of Kay Graham’s newspaper but had merely delivered it, he wouldn’t let his mother touch the money. ([Location 6950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=6950))
- The adult Buffett felt the same way about his 474,998 shares of Berkshire.44 Bill Gates occasionally sold some of his Microsoft stock, Lee Iacocca some Chrysler, and so on. But Buffett would not parcel off even a sliver of his brilliant canvas. Over a quarter century, he had not sold a single share. The ironic result is that Berkshire’s extraordinary growth did not put so much as a dime in Buffett’s pocket. From society’s point of view, he argued that it was a good thing. The dimes that he could give now were not merely dimes—to Buffett, they represented the quarters and the half-dollars that a dime could become down the road. “When I am dead,” he observed, “I assume there’ll still be serious problems of a social nature as there are now.”45 He planned to leave his stock to Susie; whichever one died last would bequeath it to the foundation. Society would get a greater benefit from his money then, after he was done heaping and piling. This was irrefutably logical, but obsessive. By the late eighties and early nineties, Buffett could have been peeling off tens of millions for society’s “serious problems” every year and still would not have diminished his pile of chips by even 1 percent. One wonders if his desire to control those chips related, at least in part, to his desire to control not only his life, but also his death. It is only human to hope, and perhaps to believe, that one will not die in the midst of a great journey. In Buffett’s “unfathomable human mind,” his command of Berkshire may have provided a sense of protection from that lifelong fear. Perhaps, like Lincoln, he would not be called while the battle was still joined.

When Jay Higgins, Salomon’s top investment banker, started to explain the company’s merits, Buffett’s Midwestern twang crackled over the speakerphone. “Don’t tell me about the economics—I know they’re great. You make a product for a penny, you sell it for a dollar, and you sell it to addicts. And it has tremendous brand loyalty.”3 ([Location 7001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7001))

- In the second half of 1989, Buffett did something. In a sudden spurt, he fashioned three big deals—with Gillette, USAir, and Champion International—totaling $1.3 billion. As a group, they were below his par. While Gillette, the world’s dominant razor blade seller, was a typical Buffett investment, USAir and paper producer Champion were capital-intensive cash absorbers and not at all the stuff of his past success. (Champion had something in common with his failures, though. Buffett ([Location 7046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7046))
- thought it might be an inflation hedge.)13 In each case, Berkshire bought a new convertible preferred stock, just as it had with Salomon Brothers. Save for Gillette, a consumer-brand company in the mold of Coca-Cola, Buffett did not have a strong opinion on the companies’ prospects.14 That is why he structured them as convertibles (with fixed dividends). Indeed, he admitted, rather gloomily, “If I had four more Coca-Colas to buy, I wouldn’t be buying these.”15 The threat of takeovers, once again, was behind these deals. Gillette had been stalked by Ronald Perelman; USAir had been put in play by Michael Steinhardt, a New York money manager; and Champion was thought to be a target. “When you’ve got an able management,” Buffett told the Washington Post, “they should have time to play out their hand.”16 Now each of those companies would have Buffett as its protective “gorilla.” In return, Berkshire would get a fixed coupon, on average 9 percent, and an option to convert to common stock (a “lottery ticket”) if the shares should… ([Location 7050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7050))
- Buffett was pocketing rich coupons for Berkshire in return for safekeeping the other CEOs’ jobs: Many Wall Street investors say Mr. Buffett’s special deals amount to a kind of gentlemanly protection game. In the old days, these investors say, corporate raiders such as Saul Steinberg got paid “greenmail” to go away. But Mr. Buffett is getting “whitemail” to stick around and hold management’s hand.17 Such sweetheart deals with the CEOs, so the argument ran, were depriving the stockholders of the freedom to sell out in takeovers. According to Forbes, Buffett gets a special deal, but so does management.… Put differently, how much does Warren Buffett charge for takeover protection?18 Buffett, of course, was not responsible to the shareholders of Gillette, USAir, and Champion. He was supposed to make good deals for Berkshire. But moralists get judged by tougher standards, and Buffett, suddenly on the defensive, seemed anxious to defend the high ground. In a letter to his holders after the “whitemail” deals, he argued:  … the other shareholders of each investee will… ([Location 7062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7062))
- deserving of protection, and will deal fairly with the inherent conflict of interest. But not every CEO is a Tom Murphy. Buffett himself, at the Columbia seminar, had argued that as imperfect as the takeover process may be, ultimately, the decision had to be up to the folks who owned the “little piece[s] of paper”—the stockholders. Champion was a particularly dubious case. Andrew Sigler, its CEO, was a vocal critic of takeovers and an active member of Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for big business. At Champion, he had poured money into the company’s mills but failed to deliver for his shareholders. Over the previous decade, a great one for stocks in general, Champion’s had risen by an abysmal 3 percent a year. Even among other paper companies, its return ranked as one of the poorest.20 The only person with much to show for Sigler’s poor record was Andrew Sigler. In 1989, a lackluster year, Sigler paid himself an $800,000 salary, plus “incentive compensation” of $425,000. In addition, he took advantage of Champion’s depressed stock price to award himself options on 31,000 shares. The next year, Champion’s earnings fell by half. Sigler upped his take to $1.2 million, plus $28,000 so he wouldn’t have to pay for his personal tax adviser, plus options on 47,000 more shares. Buffett, of course, had been a fierce critic of options,21 particularly when ([Location 7077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7077))
- doled out to poorly performing CEOs. If anyone had been desirous of taking over Champion, it’s hard to see why Buffett would have wanted to stop them. The managements of Gillette and USAir were a different story. USAir was building a national system with hubs in middle-market cities, but had yet to consolidate. It seemed to have the sort of strategy that warrants time and a little “protection.” Gillette, quite simply, was minting money. Although Buffett’s terms were richer than what an ordinary Joe could have gotten on open-market issues,22 the deals were not as sweet as his critics claimed. Berkshire was locked into each security for a decade, which on Wall Street is an eternity and then some. Indeed, most money managers would have rejected Buffett’s “sweetheart” arrangements. Nonetheless, the deals had an unwholesome aspect. They had an odor of insidership—of Buffett’s standing too close to his pals in corporate boardrooms. It may be no coincidence that he bought a swankier corporate jet that year, for $6.7 million. In his annual letter, Buffett went to lengths to poke fun at himself for this singular perk (without alluding to his exceptionally modest $100,000-a-year salary). He noted that if the cost of replacing his plane continued to rise “at the now-established rate of 100% compounded annually, it will not be long before ([Location 7089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7089))

- In 1989, Buffett also was in the news in Omaha. Mrs. B—the carpet woman—was stripped of her authority in carpets by her grandsons Ronald and Irvin, who by now were running the Furniture Mart. She quit the store in a rage, denounced Buffett for selling her out, and publicly called her grandsons “Hitlers.”32 In Omaha, the spat got the sort of attention elsewhere reserved for Charles and Princess Di. Mrs. B accused her grandsons of being spoiled ingrates who wasted their time in “meetings” and lived like “millionaires.” Besides, she added poignantly, “It hurts when you’re a nobody.”33 The ninety-five-year-old dynamo spent a few months at home. Then she opened a new store, “Mrs. B’s Warehouse,” adjacent to the Furniture Mart—now her blood rival. “It breaks my heart,” Mrs. B remarked one Sunday, motoring past a sea of carpets in her new store. She added that she now was working “for ([Location 7138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7138))
- spite.” Buffett felt terrible about it. He took two dozen pink roses to Mrs. B on her birthday to try to patch it up. But as a business matter, he backed his management. Reporting on the unhappy affair to shareholders, he praised Louie, Mrs. B’s son, as well as Ron and Irv, as “outstanding merchants.” Mrs. B probably has made more smart business decisions than any living American, but in this particular case I believe the other members of the family were entirely correct: Over the past three years, while the store’s other departments increased sales by 24%, carpet sales declined.…34 Nonetheless, one has the sense that if Buffett had been in Mrs. B’s shoes, he would have wanted to go out the same way, kicking and screaming—and that at some level he admired her for it. Shortly after her break, he spoke about her with considerable empathy: She hasn’t lost her marbles in any way, shape or form. She happens to be—improperly, in my view—very negative on a couple of the grandchildren that work in the store. Every now and then they want to take a day off with their families. Believe me, they are marvelous guys, but they can’t work as hard as Mrs. B did.… It’s a human tragedy in the sense that she couldn’t have a better family than she had. But they had it easier than she did—nothing you can do about it.35 Mrs. B’s departure did not hurt Berkshire, which hit an all-time high in September 1989 of $8,750 a share.

- that he felt most apprehensive during bull markets. He was gloomy about the lack of opportunities, and gloomy even about Berkshire. His response was nothing short of brilliant. In a mirror image of his deals with Gillette, USAir, et al., Buffett raised $400 million by selling bonds that were convertible into shares of Berkshire. The people who bought this paper got a fixed return and a “lottery ticket” on Berkshire’s stock. This time, Buffett’s terms were sweeter than sugar. His interest rate was only 5.5 percent. The low rate was a measure of the investors’ faith that Berkshire’s share price would continue rising. (They were betting on the lottery ticket.) What’s more, since these were “zero-coupon” bonds, Berkshire would owe interest, but not actually pay it, until the bonds matured, fifteen years later. But owing to a quirk in the tax laws, Berkshire could deduct the interest all along, as though it were paying. And there was more. Berkshire could redeem the “zeros” in three years.

- Berkshire’s stock, it was true, had collapsed with the rest (its low for the year was $5,500, down almost 40 percent from its peak). But it was at such times that Buffett was at his best.

- world turned gloomy, his instinct was deadly. During 1990—the worst year for banking since the Great Depression—Buffett bought 10 percent of the stock of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco banking giant. California real estate was just beginning to turn down; the misery of its banks was expected to be deep and long-lived. And Wells Fargo had lent more money to California real estate than any bank in the country. Buffett, of course, knew that. Generally, Buffett did not like banks. An outsider had no way of gauging the soundness of their loans until it was too late. But he had been pining for this bank for years.40 Wells Fargo had a strong franchise in California and one of the highest profit margins of any big bank in the country. Its chairman, Carl Reichardt, was a cost-cutter in the Tom Murphy mold. During an earlier rough period, Reichardt had sold the company jet—a sacrifice Buffett could appreciate—and frozen the salaries of the top brass. And Reichardt had largely avoided the periodic fads, such as lending to Latin America, that had undone other banks. As Buffett knew, Reichardt and Paul Hazen, the bank’s number two, had cut their teeth on property loans in the 1970s and had escaped the real estate debacle of that decade with barely a scratch. None of this meant that the outlook for Wells Fargo over the next year or so was rosy. But Buffett was thinking ([Location 7220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7220))
- about a much longer period than the next year or so. The bank was well capitalized; it ought to survive the current trauma. Indeed, Buffett reported, a bad year “would not distress us.”41 And because other people were distressed, Buffett was able to pick up $290 million worth of stock at the fire-sale average price of $58 a share, or five times earnings. That was down from a recent high of $84. After Buffett invested, Wells Fargo’s portfolio began to take in water. Wall Street wrote it off; Barton Biggs, the chief strategist at Morgan Stanley, said he had no idea if Wells Fargo would survive and Warren Buffett didn’t either.42 In the spring quarter of 1991, Wells Fargo took a massive reserve against the possibility that loans would not be repaid. Earnings plunged to twenty-one cents a share, compared with $4.40 in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Buffett responded with aplomb; in fact, he asked for regulatory approval to double his investment. Wells Fargo, by then, was the darling of short-sellers. It had almost $15 billion in commercial real estate… ([Location 7230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7230))
- bust, developers were quixotically racing to complete new skyscrapers that they now had no hope of renting. In Orange County, 22 percent of the office space was vacant. A bear on Wells Fargo, writing in Banon’s, sardonically observed that the “Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett” would be stuck with all that.43 Even many within Buffett’s crowd saw the bet on Wells Fargo as a breaking of the faith. Scott Black, a Graham-and-Dodd-style money manager, said, “It upset me. Warren made a mistake,” as though the heavens should have forbidden it. People who had been appalled by the excessive leverage of the eighties had an emotional stake in seeing the guilty get their just deserts—and real estate lenders were “guilty.” Buffett also disapproved of excessive leverage, but he stripped the emotion out of his calculations. At a certain price, he was happy to buy a bank, or even a junk bond. During the height of the gloom, a Manhattan friend called to “warn” him that the smart money was saying that Wells could go under. Buffett said calmly, “We’ll see who’s… ([Location 7242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7242))
- more cash at Buffett’s disposal and fewer places to put it could be counted on to induce a new spell of rhinophobia. When Buffett got a call from James D. Robinson III, chairman of American Express, he was all ears. Robinson, the courtly son of an Atlanta banking family, was a fellow Coca-Cola director and a social chum of Buffett’s. An habitué of boardrooms who held thirteen directorships, Robinson projected a refined, statesmanlike air. His dark-wood, river-view office seemed to whisper “old money.” Personally, Buffett was fond of Robinson. What he thought of him as a CEO of American Express was not so clear. The company’s charge cards and traveler’s checks had remained a very good business. During the most recent decade, their profits had galloped ahead at an 18-percent-a-year clip. But Robinson’s shareholders had never seen that 18 percent. Robinson had frittered away the profits of this very good business on a series of bad ones—in insurance, banking, brokerage, even an art gallery specializing in nineteenth-century American paintings. Eager… ([Location 7253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7253))
- bailing out. To make matters worse, American Express had a habit of not coming clean with the bad news until after the fact.44 Robinson had managed to elude the blame for such miscues, partly thanks to his busy public relations department and partly because he had stacked the board with captive directors. One such captive, Henry Kissinger, pocketed $350,000 a year in consulting fees from the management he was supposedly overseeing. Despite Robinson’s good press, Buffett was hardly unaware of his record. In 1985, Buffett had attended an American Express board meeting, when the company was considering selling its Fireman’s Fund insurance unit to a group that included Buffett. Buffett gave the board some advice: it should sell Fireman’s to somebody and focus on American Express’s one truly splendid business.45 A bit later, when insurer GEICO bought a chunk of American Express’s stock, Buffett had called GEICO to express his concern. Though Buffett didn’t put it in such terms, Robinson’s record was a compendium of the managerial sins that Buffett had bewailed… ([Location 7263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7263))
- career. Now, as before, the company was in trouble. Just weeks earlier, its credit had been downgraded. When Robinson asked for a $300 million investment, Buffett quickly agreed. As Buffett noted at the time, with the market at a high, he was finding few things he liked, and he did like American Express’s basic business. Still, it is hard to account for his saying “We’re buying to be in with Jim [Robinson].”46 Buffett’s friends were stunned. He had even agreed—reluctantly, but nonetheless—to a term that capped Berkshire’s potential upside. Jack Byrne, who was an American Express director, told Business Week he would have thought that Buffett’s “genes” would have forbidden such an agreement.47 When they spoke privately, Byrne realized that Buffett regarded his earlier American Express investment as a milestone in his career and was eager to play a part in restoring the company. Buffett told him, “This is coming home again.” Of course, he had also come home to GEICO and to the Washington Post He liked these old shoes, just as he liked investing in the soft drink that he had delivered… ([Location 7274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7274))
- Buffett sat in the witness chair, facing the members. As he began to speak, his left arm swung in a decisive arc: I would like to start by apologizing for the acts that have brought us here. The Nation has a right to expect its rules and laws will be obeyed. At Salomon, certain of these were broken. The baldness of his apology would outlive all that followed. Captains of Wall Street had been appearing in Congress since J. P. Morgan, Sr.’s, defiant performance in the Pujo hearings of 1912. Until now, none had ever said he was sorry. A dozen shutters click-click-clicked. Buffett made a pitch for Salomon’s eight thousand employees, most of whom were “hardworking, able, and honest.” He promised new measures to ensure compliance with the law. But in the end, he recognized, “the spirit of compliance is as important, or more so, as the words.” Speaking of his vision for the new Salomon, Buffett reached for one of those vivid images that seemed to spring from the lectern into America’s living rooms: I want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear on the front page of their local paper the next day, to be read by their spouses, children and friends.… If they follow this test, they need not fear my other message to them: Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.

- Buffett’s emphasis on reputation was oddly reminiscent of Morgan’s testimony that character—not money—was the basis of credit. There the similarity ended. Morgan, whatever else, epitomized Wall Street. Buffett, who had made a fortune in the stock market, was hailed as a Main Street antidote to Wall Street’s excesses. It is doubtful that Salomon could have found another living American who represented both these extremes. ([Location 7856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=7856))

Remarkably, she sold her new store to Berkshire for $5 million and returned to the fold.2 At ninety-nine, she continued to work at the new locale, in charge of her own carpet business, seven days a week. “I am delighted that Mrs. B has again linked up with us,” Buffett reported happily. “Her business story has no parallel.

- If one tacks on the record of Buffett Partnership, Buffett has been doing it for four decades, without much leverage, without speculating or taking undue risks, and without suffering a single down year.6 Although nay-sayers continue to greet his each new investment with a chorus that “this time” Buffett has finally blown it, no one else has a record over a similar span that compares. Arguably, no one is close. Among history’s great capitalists, Buffett stands out for his sheer skill at evaluating businesses. What John D. Rockefeller, the oil cartelist, Andrew Carnegie, the philanthropic steel baron, Sam Walton, the humble retailer, and Bill Gates, the software nerd, have in common is that each owes his fortune to a single product or innovation.

- Given this embarrassment of riches—from Disney to GEICO to super-cats—it is small surprise that the public’s expectations for Berkshire were becoming inflated. By early 1996, its share price was swelling toward $40,000. Buffett was worried that the ([Location 8285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8285))
- shares were becoming bait for speculators, and he was highly agitated by the plans of a couple of promoters to take advantage of Berkshire’s unusual share price by peddling low-priced “clones.” (The promoters intended to create investment trusts that would purchase shares of Berkshire and then sell low-priced units to the public.) Obsessed, as usual, with controlling every aspect of Berkshire, Buffett decided to beat these promoters to the punch with a baby Berkshire of his own. In a sort of do-it-yourself stock split, Buffett devised a new issue of Berkshire—Class B common stock—worth 1/30 of the old shares and expected to trade at 1/30 the price. Shareholders could hang on to the ordinary common, now known as Class A, or (at any time) convert—one A share for thirty B shares. (Buffett would keep the high-priced variety.) Of course, in value terms they were identical: the same pizza cut in thirty slices. ([Location 8287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8287))
- But given that small investors attracted to his celebrity might be especially tempted to hop aboard the “cheaper” B stock, Buffett did what virtually no chief executive has ever done—he warned that the price of his stock (then $36,000) was more than he would pay for it. Berkshire’s intrinsic value had continued to grow at an impressive rate, but its stock, in recent years, had… ([Location 8295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8295))
- underperformance as well.” In short, investors who pay too much for Berkshire—or any stock—implicitly are betting on its high performance to continue, perhaps for many years into the future. Discussion of such an extended time period makes Buffett’s shareholders uncomfortable. It reminds them of the one “super-cat” they fear the most. As one shareholder and longtime friend admitted bluntly, “All of us have a vested interest in Warren’s good health.”14 Among the stockholders, the size of the “Buffett premium”—that is, the amount above fair value that Buffett’s presence adds to the stock—is a subject of endless debate. It is feared that his death could be followed by panic selling, though, as Buffett would be quick to point out, his death would not affect the value of Berkshire’s Coca-Cola stock or of any of its other assets. Save for rare occasions, such as his recent annual letter, Buffett does not comment on what he thinks Berkshire is worth. His policy is to disclose what he will about the company and let trading follow its course. But the obsession… ([Location 8298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8298))
- When Doris, his elder sister, researched the Buffett family tree, Warren said the only thing he wanted to know about his ancestors was how long they had lived.15 Another time, he remarked to a friend that although scientists had not found a correlation between age and wealth, he didn’t think they had ever studied age and superwealth.16 Still again, when a shareholder asked what his goal was, now that he had become the richest man in the country, Buffett spit out, “To become the oldest one.”17 Even in his private life, he married a woman with a singular interest in helping people cope with death. It is scarcely implausible that Buffett’s fear of death has contributed to his drive to accumulate. Agnostic and hyperrational, he has few other opiates. His one passion has been to collect—not money, precisely, but tangible evidence of himself. He clings to his friends, his house, his old foods and stock lines, and his stocks themselves. Notably, he says he does not enjoy running businesses; he enjoys owning them.18 In the view of his friend Barbara Morrow, the formative trauma of his life was when he was… ([Location 8309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8309))

- Most of the faces at Borsheim’s are familiar to Buffett. He mentions that he knows a relative of 90 percent of Berkshire’s 7,500 shareholders on sight. He greets James Earl, a balding astronomy professor, and proudly recalls that Earl’s parents invested with Buffett in the partnership back in 1957. Indeed, Buffett tracks the destiny of every one of Berkshire’s million-plus shares—a level of familiarity that no other public CEO would dream of or, for that matter, even remotely desire. But Buffett knows them all. Each time a share of Berkshire trades, Buffett makes a mental note of it, as though someone were getting on and off his trolley. This helps to explain Buffett’s hold on his admirers. As uncanny as his success has been, his sense of fidelity is even rarer. His faithfulness to old friends and old habits illuminates his entire career. Consider, for a moment, the advice of John Train in his best-selling The Money Masters: Everything has its season, which does not last forever. The world changes its spots, and the investor must change his.20 Few people on Wall Street would disagree, or even give it a second thought.

- rest, have already lost their taste for leverage and in the nineties are selling equity. Yet Buffett has spent a lifetime wearing essentially the same spots. He has never opted for investment fashions, be it the Go-Go stocks of the sixties, the high leverage of the eighties, or the derivatives of the nineties. He has continued to hunt for the irreducible kernel that his teacher labeled “intrinsic value.” Much has been made of Buffett’s metamorphosis away from Ben Graham, from “value” stocks to “growth” companies. The Street is fond of such pigeonholes, just as the critic of art is quick to recognize a Blue Period or a cubist phase. But such boundaries are irrelevant to the artist. To Buffett, the growth/value distinction has always been illusory. He sees the growth potential of a business as a component of its value, just as its assets are a component.21 At a price, Coca-Cola’s potential represents good value; at some higher price, it does not. The point is that Buffett views all investing, and all that he has ever attempted, as “value investing.” Anything else, he wrote a year after the Salomon episode, is unworthy of the name: What is “investing” if it is not the act of seeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid? Consciously paying more for a stock than its calculated value—in the hope that it can soon be sold for a still-higher price—should be labeled ([Location 8344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8344))

- Buffett has made one truly significant change—a reworking of his estate. Ironically, though this is a personal matter, it is likely to influence his public legacy more than any investment he has made. Half a century ago, as a Pepsi-Cola-imbibing young man, Buffett agonized (as he admitted to Jerry Orans) over what to do with his fortune—a fortune he had not yet obtained but that he was sure would one day be his. The problem nagged at him for fifty years, looming larger as his assets grew. Always he had the cushion of believing that his wife, Susie, would outlive him, and that if need be she would dispose of their assets. However, in 2004 Susie died of a stroke. Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, but the inheritance issue could no longer be postponed. In 2006, Buffett stunningly ([Location 8535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8535))
- reversed his intention to hang on to his assets until death—and announced a plan to slowly give away (with annual bequests) 85 percent of his Berkshire stock. Five-sixths of the money will go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily dedicated to fighting disease in the developing world. The rest will go to four family foundations (one that was his and Susie’s and three others, each of which is run by one of the Buffett children). The plan to transfer stock to Gates was a lightning bolt that only Buffett could have conceived of. Combining his money with that of his close friend—in recent years the only American richer than he—will create by far the world’s largest foundation. The size of Buffett’s annual gifts will depend, of course, on the future level of Berkshire stock, but at current prices, Buffett has a fortune of $64 billion—probably the greatest on earth. And yet, what is truly notable about the plan is its modesty. It is not just that the bulk of Buffett’s money will be administered by someone else, and that no hospitals will bear the Buffett name, nor will researchers, scientists, and doctors around the globe associate their funding with the Oracle of Omaha. It is his trademark insistence on staying within his “circle of competence”—on doing only what he is good at. By temperament, he was a poor philanthropist. He was too fearful of not getting good value to feel easy about ([Location 8541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8541))
- writing checks (or perhaps, to use a Buffettism, he was simply too cheap). In any case, his refusal to give, or to give in proportion to his means, has long been a sore spot to his friends. And so, turning his logical mind to his own estate, he coolly decided to give his money to someone better equipped to dispense of it than he—a trusted friend who in all likelihood should have decades remaining to oversee the bequests and who, most important, has conceived of a purpose worthy of Buffett’s billions: ridding the poorest regions of the globe of disease. As a portfolio manager, Buffett has always tried to concentrate on a few stocks—a very few—that he both understood and felt comfortable with. With his estate, similarly, it is as though Buffett sees in the Gates couple, Melinda as well as Bill, a superstock of philanthropy—a nondiversified vehicle through… ([Location 8551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DPTL2F0&location=8551))
