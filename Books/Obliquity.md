## Highlights
- For over ten years, I built and ran an economic consultancy business, and much of our revenue was derived from selling models to large corporate clients. One day I asked myself a question: If these models were helpful, why did we not build similar models for our own decision making? The answer, I realized, was that our customers didn’t really use these models for their decision making either. They used them internally or externally to justify decisions that they had already made. They were playing what I now call Franklin’s gambit, after Benjamin Franklin. He wrote: “So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one had a mind to do.”1 Franklin’s remark about hindsight rationalization is particularly significant, not just because he was a clever man but because, as I will describe in chapter ten, he has come to be regarded as the founding father of scientific decision making. Of course, we told ourselves privately, our clients were being stupid—that was why they didn’t use our models. But we didn’t think we were stupid, and we didn’t use them either. I can remember a couple of occasions on which a spreadsheet analysis did help us to solve problems of our own, both of them related to the financing of the business. But that was all. Like many economists we believed that if our models did not describe the world, the fault lay with the world, not the model. But it isn’t just economists who make that mistake. Politicians, investors and bankers, businesspeople believe that although they don’t solve problems according to a standard model of rational decision making, they ought to. So they pretend that they do—to others, and perhaps to themselves. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=60))

- These failures of both policy and prediction have encouraged economists and other social scientists to look at what people actually do rather than imposing on them models of how economists think people should behave. One popular book with this approach adopts the title Predictably Irrational.2 But this title reflects the same mistake that my colleagues and I made when we privately disparaged our clients for their stupidity. If people are predictably irrational, perhaps they are not irrational at all: Perhaps the fault lies not with the world but with our concept of rationality. Perhaps we should think differently about how we really make decisions and solve problems. Perhaps we should recognize the ubiquity, and inevitability, of obliquity.

- The term obliquity was suggested to me by Sir James Black, the Nobel Prize–winning pharmacologist whose contribution to the development of ICI’s pharmaceutical business is described in chapter three. In the course of verifying that history, I talked to Black about his reasons for leaving ICI to join another British pharmaceutical company, SmithKline. At SmithKline Black discovered another blockbuster drug, and the indirect effect was to stimulate a third company, Glaxo, to create and market Zantac, which would become the world’s best-selling prescription drug. Black probably created more shareholder value than any other man in postwar British business, but his motivation was to pursue chemistry, not profit. He left ICI, he told me, because his interests were in furthering his research, not helping to market his discoveries. “I used to tell my colleagues [at ICI] that if they wanted profits, there were many easier routes than drug research. How wrong could I have been!” he told me, and went on, “I call it the principle of obliquity: Goals are often best achieved without intending them.” ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=86))

- Obliquity describes the process of achieving complex objectives indirectly. In general, oblique approaches recognize that complex objectives tend to be imprecisely defined and contain many elements that are not necessarily or obviously compatible with one another, and that we learn about the nature of the objectives and the means of achieving them during a process of experiment and discovery. Oblique approaches often step backward to move forward. All these things were true of the activities that engaged Cortés (or Balboa). Like other great achievers, they tackled problems whose nature emerged only as they solved them. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=128))

- An oblique approach recognizes that what we want from a home, or a community, has many elements. We will never succeed in specifying fully what they are, and to the extent that we do, we discover that they are often incompatible and inconsistent. The interactions between a home and its occupants, or among the people who make up a community, are complex and uncertain. Experience of both previous and current problems guides the search for answers. Many people contribute to the outcome, and even after that outcome has been realized none of them necessarily holds a full understanding of how it came about. That is how the cathedral of Notre Dame was built, by many hands over several centuries. Reengineering the Corporation, by Michael Hammer and James Champy, was one of the best-selling business books of the 1990s, and Hammer and Champy were as radical in aspiration as Le Corbusier: These ideas, we believe, are as important to business today as Adam Smith’s ideas were to the entrepreneurs and managers of the last two centuries. [Reengineering] means asking the question “If I were re-creating this company today, given what I know and given current technology, what would it look like?” Reengineering a company means tossing aside old systems and starting over. It involves going back to the beginning and inventing a better way of doing work.10 ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=152))

- The environment—social, commercial, natural—in which we operate changes over time and as we interact with it. Our knowledge of that complex environment is necessarily piecemeal and imperfect. And so objectives are generally best accomplished obliquely rather than directly. This book is divided into three parts. In part one (chapters two through six) I will illustrate the role of obliquity in our personal and our working lives. Happiness is not achieved through the pursuit of happiness. The most profitable businesses are not the most profit oriented. The wealthiest people are not those most assertive in the pursuit of wealth. The greatest paintings are not the most accurate representations of their subjects; the forests most resistant to fires are not the ones whose foresters are best at putting out fires. Soviet planners managed the economy far less successfully than the adaptive, disorganized processes of market economies. In part two (chapters seven through twelve) I will describe the factors that make direct approaches impracticable for so many problems and demonstrate the need for obliquity. Our objectives are often necessarily loosely described and frequently have elements that are not just incompatible but incapable of being compared with one another. The consequences of our actions depend on the responses of other people, and these responses spring not just from our actions but from their perceptions of our motives for undertaking these actions. We deal with complex systems whose structure we can understand only imperfectly. The problems we face are rarely completely specified, and the environment in which we tackle them contains irresolvable uncertainties.

- In part three (chapters thirteen through twenty) I describe the oblique approach to problem solving and decision making. In obliquity there are no predictable connections between intentions and outcomes. Oblique problem solvers do not evaluate all available alternatives: they make successive choices from a narrow range of options. Effective decision makers are distinguished not so much by the superior extent of their knowledge as by their being aware of its limitations. Problem solving is iterative and adaptive rather than direct. Good decision makers are not identified by their ability to provide compelling accounts of how they reached their conclusions. The most complex systems come into being, and function, without anyone having knowledge of the whole. Good decision makers are eclectic and tend to regard consistency as a mark of stubbornness, or ideological blindness, rather than as a virtue. Rationality is not defined by good processes; irrationality lies in persisting with methods and actions that plainly do not work—including the methods and actions that commonly masquerade as rationality.

- People experiencing flow do not say they are happy: Csikszentmihalyi asks his subjects to report regularly on their state of mind, and they are more likely to tell him they are happy when they are socializing with friends than when they are in flow. Perhaps people in flow are just too busy to be happy. But flow experiences seem to contribute greatly to long-term well-being.

- Csikszentmihalyi reports that many people describe their flow experiences as “moments that stand out as being the best in their lives.” If he is right—and most readers will recognize the feelings he describes—then the people who seek happiness in these oblique and superficially unpromising ways are not making mistakes. Through experiences we normally associate with unhappiness they achieve greater happiness than if they had sought happiness directly. Perhaps people are confused about what makes them happy.4 Anyone who has changed a diaper, or failed to quiet a childish tantrum, will recognize that looking after children is an oblique route to happiness. Csikszentmihalyi reports that people are happier when they are at work than when they’re caring for a child, and researchers observe that reported happiness increases sharply when children leave home.5 Yet many people also say that bringing up their children was the best experience of their life. Perhaps, under social pressure to applaud the experience of child rearing, people say their children make them happy even though that is not how they really feel. But it’s more likely that people who say that bringing up their children has made them very happy are telling the truth. And when the same people say that much of the time they spent with their children was not happy, they are also telling the truth. Mountaineers like Messner do not say that being cold, starved of oxygen and at frequent risk of injury or death makes them happy. They confirm the commonsense assumption that such experiences are unpleasant. But the experience of having accomplished a difficult climb makes them immensely happy. They are not contradicting themselves, because happiness is not simply the aggregate of happy moments. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=225))

- Happiness is where you find it, not where you look for it. The shortest crossing of America was found by seekers for gold, not explorers of oceans.

- But the last word in this chapter should go to Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric from 1981 to 2001. Welch was not just America’s most admired businessman but a darling of Wall Street. The rise in the market capitalization of GE during Welch’s tenure represented the greatest creation of shareholder value ever. Ten years into retirement, he told the Financial Times: “Shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world.”20 Elaborating his thought to Business Week a few days later, he explained: The job of a leader and his or her team is to deliver to commitments in the short term while investing in the long term health of the business. . . . Employees will benefit from job security and better rewards. Customers will benefit from better products or services. Communities will benefit because successful companies and their employees give back. And obviously shareholders will benefit because they can count on companies who will deliver on both their short term commitments and long term vision.21 The route to profit was an oblique one.

- Seventy years after his death, it is still hard to disentangle the mixture of motives that made John D. Rockefeller not only the world’s richest man, but also its greatest philanthropist. I believe the power to make money is a gift from God—just as are the instincts for art, music, literature, the doctor’s talent, the nurse’s, yours—to be developed and used to the best of our ability for the good of mankind. Having been endowed with the gift I possess, I believe it is my duty to make money and still more money: and to use the money I make for the good of my fellow man according to the dictation of my conscience.1 Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-born steel magnate and contemporary of Rockefeller, applied the same determination to giving his fortune away that he applied to building it. “The man who dies rich thus dies disgraced,” he famously remarked.2 ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=407))

- The history of the last two decades is littered with fallen idols who, like Dunlap, stridently asserted the primacy of wealth. Gordon Gekko, the antihero of Oliver Stone’s 1987 film Wall Street, famously proclaimed: “Greed is good.” Gekko was partly based on Ivan Boesky, a notorious corporate raider of the 1980s, who was reported as telling a class at Columbia: “I want you to know that I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.”11 Soon after, Boesky went to prison, convicted of insider trading. The businesses that epitomized the explosion of greed on Wall Street in the 1980s were Salomon Brothers (the firm mercilessly caricatured in Michael Lewis’s Liar’s Poker)12 and Drexel Burnham Lambert (more gently pilloried in Connie Bruck’s The Predators’ Ball).13 Salomon turned bond trading from a backwater into the activity of choice for the financially ambitious, while Drexel Burnham Lambert pioneered the issue of junk bonds. Salomon, whose abuses had exhausted the patience of the U.S. Treasury, had to be rescued by Warren Buffett (in a rare error) and was eventually taken over by Citigroup (which closed its trading operations). Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=500))

- In this chapter and the last, I’ve described the most spectacular exemplars of the era of corporate and financial-sector greed—Citigroup, Bear Stearns and Lehman, before them Salomon, Drexel and Bankers Trust. The common feature of every one of these companies is that huge sums of money were made by individuals in them but the business itself ultimately incurred massive losses of money, reputation or both. No deep knowledge of finance is needed to understand why these companies were financially successful only briefly and commercial failures in the long run. A corporate culture that extols greed cannot, in the end, protect itself against its own employees. Nor does the business with such a culture attract public sympathy when things go wrong (although large bailouts were provided to limit the damage their collapse imposed or would have imposed on the wider economy). The motives that make for success in business are commitment to, passion for, business, which is not at all the same as love of money—a lesson that Lehman did not learn.

- For Plutarch, to be fortunate was to live—and die—well. Aristotle wrote of eudaimonia, which is sometimes translated as happiness but more often as flourishing. Aristotle’s concept, and the ethical system it implies, has influenced our thought for two millennia. But most philosophers and psychologists perceive a difference between happiness and eudaimonia.

- The psychologist Daniel Nettle suggests that there are three broad senses of the term happiness.2 The lowest—the basic level—comprises the momentary feelings that make us happy—the joy of sex, the pleasure of a beautiful sunset. The intermediate level is typically a state of mind rather than a physical response, a sense of satisfaction and well-being. These states of mind involve judgments about feelings as distinct from the feelings themselves. Eudaimonia is a high-level concept, a measure of quality of life, of flourishing, of fulfilling one’s potential. Similar distinctions and taxonomies are used by other writers.3 ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=543))

- An old story tells of a visitor who encounters three stonemasons working on a medieval cathedral and asks each what he is doing. “I am cutting this stone to shape,” says the first, describing his basic actions. “I am building a great cathedral,” says the second, describing his intermediate goal. “And I am working for the glory of God,” says the third, describing his high-level objective. The construction of architectural masterpieces required that high objectives be pursued through lesser, but nonetheless fulfilling, goals and actions. The identification of high-level objectives, intermediate goals and basic actions is relevant in many contexts. Actions are associated with momentary feelings, and we use words like pleasure , efficiency, reward to describe them. Intermediate states and goals are described in states and achievements, and we employ terms such as wealth and welfare. High-level objectives are accomplishments like personal flourishing and fulfillment, the sustenance of a great society, the creation of a fine business. For high-level objectives, we use language such as fulfillment, greatness, excellence, goodness. Intermediate states and goals are wealth, a contented home life or profit. Actions are taking a new job or playing with one’s children, introducing new products or reducing the size of the workforce.

- To function, we have to break a high-level objective—such as living well—into goals and actions. When Jack Welch lauded obliquity, he went on to point out that the injunction “maximize shareholder value” is not a useful guide to executive action. “That’s not a strategy that helps you know what to do when you come to work every day.”4 Building a cathedral seems a problem amenable to direct solution. Priests issue commissions, architects draw up plans, constructors put the stones in place. The problem seems to be determinate—we know the objective. The problem seems to be closed—we can define the possibilities open to us. The problem seems relatively simple—we understand the relationships between the different components.

- In a business environment—or any other environment with these characteristics—decision making cannot proceed by defining objectives, analyzing them into goals and subsequently breaking them down into actions. No priest or politician, counselor or manager, has the capacity to do this—and those who claim to, like Le Corbusier or Lenin, have immense capacity to damage the complex systems they attempt to plan. In that imperfectly understood world, high-level objectives are best achieved by constantly balancing their incompatible and incommensurable components—through obliquity.

- Building cathedrals takes time. The Florentine cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore was intended to have the largest dome of any modern building. The problem for over a century was that no one knew how to build it. According to Vasari in his Lives of the Painters,1 Brunelleschi won the commission to complete the structure by challenging his rivals to stand an egg upright on a piece of marble. After they all failed, he simply tapped the shell down on the marble and stood the egg on its broken end. He went on to crack the problem of constructing the dome. When Brunelleschi’s rivals pointed out that anyone could have solved the egg problem in that way, the architect replied that anyone could build his dome once they had seen his solution. You don’t have to believe this story to recognize the validity of its point. Brunelleschi just perceived problems differently. His combination of obliquity and linearity is seen, literally and figuratively, in his greatest achievement—the discovery of perspective. He drew things as we see them, rather than as we know they are. That notion now seems obvious, but painters had represented the world differently for thousands of years. Brunelleschi’s skill lay in his original interpretation of the problem. Such obliquity of approach distinguishes the genius from the merely competent, the creative problem solver from the computer. The computer is very good at solving the problem we have specified and asked it to solve, but less useful when we are not quite sure what the problem is.

- Suppose you are organizing a tennis competition with fifty participants. What is the smallest number of matches you need schedule to find a winner? You might have twenty-five games in the first round, then twelve games in the second (giving one player a free ticket to round three) and so on. Or, better, you could have only eighteen matches in the first round. Then eighteen winners from the thirty-six players would join the remaining fourteen in round two. Once you have planned two or three possible ways of organizing the competition, you will probably notice that there are always forty-nine matches. In a knockout competition every player, except the eventual winner, is defeated once and once only, so the number of matches is one less than the number of players. Iteration and experience lead us to the best principles of analysis. The oblique solution involves recasting the problem—often described as lateral thinking—and then it becomes direct.

- A well-known brainteaser involves a man walking the mile home from his office. As he sets off, his affectionate dog leaves home to meet him, and when it does so, it licks his hand and returns home. It repeats the process of running from home to meet its master again and again until finally dog and master arrive home together. If the man walks three miles per hour, and the dog twelve miles per hour, how far does the dog run? Most people approach this problem by calculating, correctly, that the dog first meets its owner after he has walked one-fifth of a mile—and so on. You can easily calculate the answer this way, at least if you know about the math of infinite series. But it is simpler to note that if the dog runs four times as fast as the man walks, the dog will have run four miles. The oblique solution complicates the problem to simplify it: The direct solution is inefficient, the oblique more direct. Invented puzzles frequently have this paradoxical character. They are a response to the everyday pleasure we take in obliquity. Most people regard arithmetic as a boring task—they do not enjoy long division or calculating the square root of a large number—but many like mathematical puzzles. The most famous such problem—Fermat’s Last Theorem—continues to intrigue. The 1994 proof by Andrew Wiles demands powerful computational tools.4 But Fermat hinted at a simpler solution that has not yet been rediscovered. Perhaps there is an oblique approach that, like Brunelleschi’s egg, or the presentation of perspective, or the Japanese assault on Singapore, is direct once thought of.

- The complexity of the relationship between the whole and the parts is an important reason why obliquity—the process of adaptation and discovery—is, as it was for the foresters, the best means of promoting the health of the whole. Yellowstone blazed, and Lehman failed, because those who imposed direct solutions to problems did not appreciate the complex relationships among objectives, goals and actions. Extinguishing all fires made the forest more vulnerable, and the bonus culture destroyed the organization that fostered it.

- The nineteenth-century French scientist Louis Pasteur made numerous important scientific discoveries, including that of immunization based on artificial tissue cultures. His method of discovery was oblique: Pasteur observed the effect when a botched experiment by his assistant produced unexpected results. That fortunate accident anticipated the similar obliquity of the most important of all pharmacological discoveries, that of penicillin. Pasteur’s pioneering innovation was not even an intermediate goal. The invention of immunization was a means of realizing the high-level objective—the advance of scientific knowledge—that was made possible by an open process of experiment and adaptation. “Fortune,” Pasteur observed, “favors the prepared mind.”10 ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=714))

- In 1959, Charles Lindblom described “the science of muddling through.” He contrasted two modes of decision making. The root, rational, comprehensive method was direct and involved a single comprehensive evaluation of all options in light of defined objectives. The oblique approach was characterized by what he called successive limited comparison. Lindblom described this process as “the science of muddling through.” “Muddling through” was a process of “initially building out from the current situation, step-by-step and by small degrees.” Lindblom contrasted muddling through with a more direct approach, but unfavorably. “The root method, the ‘best’ way as a blueprint or model, is in fact not usable for complex policy questions, and administrators are forced to use the method of successive limited comparison.”1 ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=724))

- Obliquity is a process of experiment and discovery. Successes and failures and the expansion of knowledge lead to reassessment of our objectives and goals and the actions that result. Oblique approaches to high-level objectives should not be equated with unstructured, “intuitive” decision making. Lindblom’s vision of “muddling through” is a disciplined, ordered process. Picasso, Sam Walton, Buffett—each “muddled through,” in Lindblom’s sense. None relied on a root analysis of defined objectives. Each improvised, constantly. Each pursued a combination of high-level objectives, intermediate goals and basic actions. Each drastically limited the alternatives that were reviewed and ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=762))

- Sudoku is different. It requires solvers to fill in the numbers one through nine in each nine-square segment of a nine-by-nine grid. Computer programs, which can quickly crunch through all possible arrangements, will solve any sudoku problem on a desktop machine within seconds. The rules of sudoku are simple yet comprehensive. The contestant must deduce the (unique) solution devised by an omnipotent observer (the puzzle setter). If the world were like sudoku, decision making could be tackled in an equally direct way. The characteristics of sudoku that make such an approach possible are: ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=783))

- • There is one and only one solution, and when it is identified we know that we have found it. Objectives are clear and constant. • The play is not influenced by the responses of others to one’s moves. Interactions with others, if they are relevant at all, are limited and controllable or predictable. • There is a complete list of possible actions, and we know that all the potential actions we consider are in fact available to us. Even if we do not know what will happen in the future, we know the range of possibilities and can sensibly attach probabilities to them. The problem is closed. • The number of alternative ways of filling in the boxes, although running into many millions, is nevertheless sufficiently small that all can, at least in principle, be evaluated. Complexity, even if extensive, is bounded. The game of sudoku is closed, determinate and tractable and has a clear-cut objective. Yet human brains are attuned to real problems, not artificial ones. Although we could solve sudoku directly, as a computer would, we nevertheless solve it obliquely (and this is the only way we might take any pleasure in its solution). The general strategy is to tackle problems by adaptively translating the objective into intermediate goals and states (completing blocks) and basic actions (finding ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=788))

- individual numbers). That strategy iterates, adapts, retreats when attempted solutions prove less promising than they appear. The methods of analysis that come naturally to us are oblique, and we derive no pleasure from direct, mechanical approaches. Anyone who buys a computer program to solve a sudoku problem has missed the point of the game. Chess is more complicated than sudoku. But not so much more. The range of possibilities is larger, but still finite. There is no room for doubt about whether a move is legal or a solution valid. The rules are fixed. They do not change after we have begun the game. We might agree to play by different rules, but then we would not be playing chess. Chess, as we will see, lies on the boundary between the kinds of problems that are best solved directly and those that demand oblique solutions.

- Where objectives are clear and simple and policy and implementation can readily be distinguished, when interactions with others are limited and predictable, when we are confident in our ability to specify completely the available options and the risks to our objectives, when we feel we understand the systems with which we deal, when we can feel confident in our abstractions, our approach can be more direct.

- If we enjoy brain teasers such as sudoku, it is because the objective is clear, there is a best means of achieving it and when we have found it we know that we have found it. The further appeal of the good puzzle is that although the problem seems susceptible to direct solution, that solution is difficult and an oblique approach works much better. Most real-life problems have less clear descriptions. Our high-level objectives are loosely defined and cannot be completely broken down in advance into specific goals and actions. Good problem solving and decision making is necessarily oblique because in the process of solving problems we learn not just about strategies for achieving our high-level objectives but about the nature of the objectives themselves.

- The financially oriented ICI aimed to “maximise value for our shareholders” while Phil Condit’s Boeing focused on return on investment. Shareholder value and return on investment are not the same thing, and neither is the same as profit, as defined by IFRS or GAAP or any other standard. That observation may surprise people unfamiliar with accounting and finance. Most people outside the business world—and many within it—think there is some “true” measure of profit out there, if only people worked hard enough to find it. But anyone who has thought hard about the matter knows that the quest for the true measure of profit is as illusory as the search for a measure of poetic perfection, and for essentially similar reasons. (I wrote a book two decades ago entitled The Economic Analysis of Accounting Profitability,9 and I didn’t find the holy grail then, or since.)

- What is true of art is also true of other areas of human endeavor. What made Henry Ford or Walt Disney or Steve Jobs great businessmen was that they modified the rules by which their success, and the success of others in their industry, were measured. They changed our appreciation of what is good and bad in personal transport, in children’s entertainment, and in computing. They sold us products we had not imagined. What we mean today by a good means of personal transport is very different from what we would have meant by the same phrase a hundred and fifty years ago, as a result of people who conceived vehicles quite different from those that had already existed. The criteria of achievement are constantly redefined by great achievers. Perhaps, at some very general level of definition, what we seek from art, or education, is also universal and unchanging. But to define objectives at such a high level is so ethereal as to be uninteresting and unhelpful. The task of interpreting an objective or a goal—such as a great painting or a good education—is not just part of the job of the good artist or teacher but the principal part. The definition of the objective or goal is not separable from the means by which that objective or goal is achieved, and that is why an oblique approach is not only effective but inevitable.

- Success in recasting problems to achieve our objectives more fully than we had ourselves conceived distinguishes the great from the merely competent. And demonstrates why the direct approach is so often banal. How should I live? What makes a poem great? What constitutes a good education or good business? We don’t reach decisions about how to behave, what should go into a poem, what to teach or how to run a company as a result of performing some direct process that begins with abstract speculation about these large and general questions. We reach these decisions through an oblique process of negotiation, adaptation and compromise. As a result, these decisions will be resolved in different ways by different people at different times. As Solon observed, only at the end will we know whether life was lived well. And whether we experienced a good education, whether business decisions were successful or whether the poem approached perfection of form is something that will be known only after, and often long after, the event. Even then we will never know whether the life that was lived or the education that was received, the business that was created or the poem that was written was the best possible. No one will be buried with the epitaph “He maximized shareholder value,” not just because the objective is an unworthy intermediate goal rather than a high-level objective but because, even with hindsight, no one can tell whether the goal of maximum shareholder value was achieved. If shareholder value was indeed maximized at ICI or Boeing, it was maximized obliquely. The epitaph on men such as Henry Ford, or Bill Allen, or Walt Disney, or Steve Jobs reads instead: “He built a great business, which made money for shareholders, gave rewarding employment and stimulated the development of suppliers and distributors by meeting customers’ needs that they had not known they had before these men developed products to satisfy them.” Approaching high-level objectives in an oblique manner, they achieved many supporting goals.

- The actions of the man who buys us a drink in the hope that we will buy his mutual funds are formally the same as those of the friend who buys us a drink because he likes our company. But it is usually not too difficult to spot the difference, and the difference matters. One way in which the difference matters is that we are more likely to buy the mutual fund from the friend. That is why the salesman adopted the oblique approach of giving us a drink rather than engaging in a direct pitch for his fund. “Honesty is the best policy, a man who acts on that motive is not an honest man,” wrote Archbishop Whately two centuries ago.3 If we deal with someone for whom honesty is the best policy, we can never be sure that this is not the occasion on which, perhaps after many years, he or she will conclude that honesty is no longer the best policy. We do better to rely on people who are honest by character rather than honest by choice, because character is enduring and predictable, but policies are not.

- Oblique problem solving relies on constant experiment “because human nature and general circumstances are constantly changing” and it is only through experiment—putting new lines on the shelves—that we find out what they are. Such approaches demand diversity. The forests the National Park Service inherited were diverse, the product of thousands of years of unplanned development. In the nineteenth century, German foresters rejected unplanned evolution in favor of design. You can still see such planned forests in many countries of Europe and North America: The trees are identical and evenly spaced. The foresters have calculated the most suitable crop and the optimal planting distances. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1016))

- These forests are generally ugly and were not very successful in economic terms, far more prone to accident and disease than the planters had anticipated. The foresters saw the trees but not the forest. You cannot necessarily deduce the properties of the whole by observing the properties of the individual parts. This is true of many biological systems and of all social, political and economic systems. Monocultures are vulnerable to both economic and natural hazards. Worse, they may breed such hazards. The Irish potato famine is the most famous example. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1021))

- Central targeting, a technique of planners everywhere, regards such decentralization as an essentially mechanical problem—agents respond to stimuli as objects react to levers. Such principal/agent approaches, as they are called by economists, are sometimes a fruitful way of looking at the world. If you are clear about your objectives and sufficiently knowledgeable about the systems on which their achievement depends, then you can solve problems in this way. But objectives are often vague, complexity extensive, problem descriptions incomplete, the environment uncertain. And most important, responses change the nature of the problem itself. When the British government imposed a target of “meeting all life-threatening emergencies (category A) within eight minutes,” 5 the outcome was as shown in figure 7, page 95. We don’t know whether the measurement was misleading. In normal circumstances, paramedics apply common sense in keeping records. But once bonuses and jobs depend on them, paramedics don’t. (How exactly do the record keepers decide when the ambulance was requested or when the response arrived? Perhaps times a little over eight minutes were sometimes reported as a little under eight minutes. Perhaps the target had undesirable effects on behavior—dispatchers prioritized the calls they knew could be answered quickly at the expense of cases that were more difficult.) All we do know is that the introduction of measurement and control distorted the information needed to implement that measurement and control. This phenomenon is known as Goodhart’s law,6 after the British economist who observed that as soon as governments adopted monetary targets the aggregates they targeted changed their meaning and significance.

- Computers don’t do obliquity. Computers work through prescribed routines of any degree of complexity in a direct, linear manner with incredible speed and accuracy. Sudoku is an easy problem for a computer, and chess seems not much harder. At the dawn of the computer age, some people really believed that not just sudoku and chess but lives, loves and businesses could be efficiently run by computer. Herbert Simon, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, wrote (in 1958) that: there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create. Moreover, their ability to do other things is going to increase rapidly until—in a visible future—the range of problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied.1 ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1075))

- The scope of that project was set out by Benjamin Franklin, whose activities ranged from discovering electricity to helping to found the United States. In a famous letter to the English chemist Joseph Priestley, Franklin explained his rule for making decisions: Divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then, during three or four days’ consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives, that at different times occur to me for or against the measure. When I have got them all together in one view, I endeavour to estimate the respective weights. . . . I have found great advantage for this kind of equation, in what may be called moral or prudential algebra.3 Appraisal systems in large organizations often follow Franklin’s recommendation. When an employer appoints a person to a job or a bank approves a loan, when a civil servant presents an impact assessment of a policy proposal or a company board reviews the risks in the business, they frequently use a formal process that resembles Franklin’s rule. Charles Darwin attempted to follow Franklin’s rule when he set out the pros and cons of marriage in two opposing columns. A wife would provide “children, companionship, the charms of music and female chit chat.” She would be “an object to be beloved and played with”—though he did not seem to attach great weight to this, conceding only that a wife was in this respect “better than a dog anyhow.” But Darwin also noted the disadvantages of the married state: the prospect of “being forced to visit relatives, and to bend in every trifle”; the “loss of freedom to go where one liked, the conversation of clever men at clubs.” At the time the great biologist had completed the fieldwork on his historic voyage to the Galapagos but had not yet completed On the Origin of Species. It is almost possible to sympathize when he underlines “terrible loss of time.” We snigger at the moral algebra of Franklin and Darwin. And so did they: Both men understood perfectly well that moral algebra is not how people really make decisions and that most people actually make judgments on more complex issues in oblique ways. Below his assessment Darwin scrawled: “It is intolerable to think of spending one’s whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working—only picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa.” He ends his notes, “marry—marry—marry Q.E.D.” The following year, he wedded Emma Wedgwood; the couple had ten children.4 ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1086))

- Franklin knew that moral algebra was generally a rationalization for a decision taken more obliquely. That is why as well as Franklin’s rule he set out what I earlier called Franklin’s gambit—“So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one had a mind to do.”5 The interview report, the loan proposal, the risk evaluation, are usually exemplifications of Franklin’s gambit rather than Franklin’s rule. They are written to rationalize the decision that has already been made. Yet we think we ought to follow Franklin’s rule. Perhaps a man actually decides to marry by imagining a picture of a nice soft wife on a sofa, rather than by a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. But this process is faulty. Surely we must make our best shot at moral algebra. We must learn as much as we can about the structure of relationships among goals, states and actions, even if we can’t describe all possible options. Our knowledge of the world may be limited, but we should assemble all available information and make estimates of the factors we do not know. We should use the most powerful computers and analytic capabilities to handle complexity. We should define our goals, focus on them and reward ourselves and others for progress toward them.

- Most companies spend time discussing the question of what is their “core business.” But to close that problem you have to define your categories. The Boston Consulting Group matrix provides a widely used framework that identifies businesses as stars, cows (to be milked) or dogs (to be kicked).4 But I have never seen an analysis that didn’t define the businesses the executives to whom the report was submitted liked as stars and the ones they didn’t want as dogs. The analysts play Franklin’s gambit. Closing a problem means deciding what information should be discarded. It also means deciding which should be added.

They would have been worrying about the cold war, Japan’s economic preeminence and the effects of AIDS. These earlier uncertainties have largely been resolved, and in ways that few people expected. But the key point is not that we mostly fail to anticipate the answers, rather that we mostly fail to anticipate the relevant questions. No one predicted the catastrophes of the twentieth century—the stalemate of the First World War, the influenza pandemic, the murder of millions of people by deranged dictators. Nor did many people anticipate the transforming political and economic developments of the century—the rise and fall of communism in Russia, decolonization, the development of information technology, the changed role of women in society. Such failure of imagination is inevitable. If you could have anticipated the functions and uses of the personal computer, you would already have taken the main steps toward inventing it. To describe a future political movement or economic theory or line of philosophical thought is to bring it into existence. Most of what will be important in the future is outside our knowledge; it exists only in the future. The direct approach demands a capacity for prediction that we can never possess.

- Maps are familiar examples of decision-making models. They are, by design, simplified representations of complex reality. Jorge Luis Borges1 tells the old story of the competition to devise the most perfect map of the world. The winners realized that the only way to represent the world with complete accuracy was to replicate the world, and the map they built was therefore useless. The usual form of abstraction in business, finance and politics is the model. Like maps, models are selective simplifications. The idea is to approximate the indeterminate real problem with one that is completely determinate and simple enough to permit the computation of a correct answer. But—as in my journey to Hyde Park Gardens—the computed answer may be the correct answer to the problem in the model but the wrong answer to the problem in the world. You arrive at a bus stop, and you believe that the service operates with a frequency of ten minutes. After several minutes, no bus has arrived. What should you do?

- Of course, this model is crude. Not even the best-run bus company can make its buses arrive exactly ten minutes apart, and if the average interval is ten minutes you will sometimes have to wait eleven minutes. A more complex mathematical model can allow for randomness in actual arrival times, but a basic property of the simple model continues to hold: The longer you have already waited, the shorter the time you can expect to wait. Many people, by the time they have waited some minutes, are no longer cool and relaxed in their confidence that the bus will come shortly: They are agitated, and by the time they have waited eleven or twelve minutes, they are more agitated still. For good reason. If the model is a good description of the world, their nervousness is unjustified. But after eleven minutes, they may reasonably start to wonder whether the model describes the world well. Perhaps they were misinformed about the schedule: Perhaps the route has changed. Perhaps there is a strike at the depot or an accident on the road. The list of reasons why the model might fail is long and necessarily incomplete.

- of the model even if they have not spelled out the mathematics. The uncertainty about the bus’s arrival has two components. There is risk derived from the randomness reproduced within the model: the known unknown. There is uncertainty about the appropriateness of the model as a description of the world: the unknown unknown. The first of these components allows an objective description; the second does not: There is not, and cannot be, any analysis that shows that it is right to wait for twenty minutes but wrong to wait for twenty-five. When new data arrives—in this case, the information that the bus hasn’t—we always have the problem of whether to treat it as new data about the parameters of the model or new data about the relevance of the model. The bus problem is tricky because these alternative interpretations of the data lead to quite different decisions. Within the model, the failure of a bus to arrive encourages you to wait. But the nonarrival of the bus encourages doubt about the relevance of the model in the first place. In the first decade of the twenty-first century banks persuaded themselves that risk management could be treated as a problem that was closed, determinate and calculable—like working out when the bus will arrive. We, and they, learned that they were wrong. The most widely used template in the banking industry was called “value at risk” (VAR) and elaborated by JPMorgan. The bank published the details and subsequently spun off a business, RiskMetrics, which promotes it still.2 These risk models are based on analysis of the volatility of individual assets or asset classes and—crucially—on correlations, the relationships among the behaviors of different assets. The standard assumptions of most value-at-risk models are that the dispersion of investment returns follows the normal distribution, the bell curve that characterizes so many natural and social phenomena, and that future correlations will reproduce past ones. The assumption of normal distribution of returns seems to work well in times that are, well, normal. But what of abnormal times? The more sophisticated institutions test their own models against their own experience. But that experience is, of necessity, drawn from a period when the institution did not encounter the problems… ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1306))

These abstractions are still relatively simple because, like sudoku, they don’t involve response or interaction with the world. Chess has many of the characteristics of sudoku but also the substantial complication of an opponent who has a choice of moves. Success of the direct approach to chess was much more elusive than the optimists of the 1960s had supposed. Finally, in 1997, a chess computer defeated the then world champion, Garry Kasparov. IBM, relieved, called it quits.3 Even in chess, with a limited range of legal moves, the number of possible outcomes multiplies so rapidly that exhaustive calculation is beyond the scope of even the most powerful computer yet imagined. There is a formal procedure for describing such iterations called game theory, and its most basic solution concept—the Nash equilibrium—supposes that each player adopts the best strategy available if the other player does the same. We can expect that there is a Nash equilibrium solution to the game of chess, but we don’t know what it is.

We don’t know and it seems inconceivable that we ever will.4 And curiously, it wouldn’t help a chess player very much if we did know. If you had a book that described the perfect chess game, in which no move could ever be improved on, you would begin your match against Kasparov by playing according to the book. But Kasparov need only play one or two moves that are not in the book. These are inferior moves, to be sure, but now the book stops helping, and playing unaided against Kasparov, you will need to be a grand master to stand even a chance. To guarantee a good result, the book would need to list the best response to every possible move. But all the paper in the world would not be enough to print such a book, nor all the electricity in the world sufficient to power the computers needed to determine its content.

- is an argument that you should accept anything you are offered—one cent is better than nothing—and because that is true for the other player also, you should demand ninety-nine cents. But that isn’t what usually happens. In practice, many people reject low offers, even if the consequence is that they get nothing. Many trials of the game end very quickly with the two players agreeing to share the dollar.5 Why do people behave in these “irrational” ways? Only a few economists and game theorists find that question difficult. Everyone else knows that our approach to problem solving is more oblique. We are influenced by the context. We like the other person, or we want to develop a reputation as a tough negotiator. We feel angry at a derisory offer; we think that an equal division is fair. The experimenters have tried to eliminate these subjective factors. They lock their subjects in a room where they can’t see the other person. They tell them they only have to play the game once. They are trying to create a problem with defined objectives that is closed, simple and divorced from any social or economic context. What they are trying to do, of course, is to construct a problem to which the direct approach… ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1350))

- frequently be uncertain about the other player’s objectives. Real ultimatum games only superficially resemble the experimenter’s problem. These real-life problems are neither closed nor simple. Even in an everyday ultimatum problem like negotiating a deal for a new car, we don’t have the complete specification of the options available to us, and to the other player, that the ultimatum game provides. In a loose sense, we negotiate all the time—with our family and friends, our workmates, our employer. So we use oblique methods that depend on our interpretation of the context of the negotiations, and anger and a sense of fairness influence our responses to ultimatum problems. Models are simplifications, and the appropriate simplifications are subjective. My failure with the London Underground map was not a failure in the map, or in my use of the map. The journey suggested by the map followed the best route by Underground from Paddington to Lancaster Gate; the map did not raise the question of whether it made sense to go by Underground from Paddington to Lancaster Gate at all.

- earthquakes were expressions of the anger of the gods. Sophisticated and educated people routinely anthropomorphize the planet, or Mr. Market. They mistakenly believe that things happen only because someone, somewhere, meant them to happen. The teleological fallacy, which infers causes from outcomes, is one of the oldest mistakes people make. Today we are less inclined to make this error in observing the natural world, but in the business and political spheres the assumption that the good or bad outcome derives from good or bad design remains pervasive. This is how Tolstoy described it: The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people fill whole volumes and demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been won.7 ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1415))

The direct decision maker believes that order is the production of a directing mind; the oblique decision maker recognizes that order often emerges spontaneously—no one fully grasps it. The direct problem solver insists on consistency, on always treating the same problem in the same way; the oblique problem solver never encounters exactly the same problem twice. The direct decision maker emphasizes the importance of rationality of process; the oblique decision maker believes that decision making is inherently subjective and prefers to emphasize good judgment. In the following chapters I review each of these issues in turn. Oblique decision makers and problem solvers understand that the connection of intention and outcome is often not apparent either in prospect or retrospect. Hindsight colors our interpretations of events and history—and yet even with hindsight we often do not really understand either causes or outcomes.

- THE STOCKDALE PARADOX—How We Have Less Freedom of Choice Than We Think The oblique decision maker reviews only a small subset of the options in principle available. Napoleon did not direct the course of the battle of Borodino because for much of the time he did not know what was going on, and Sculley’s position was little different. Beckham did not have time to review many alternatives before he kicked his goal. Prisoners experience particularly severe constraints on their choices. Jim Collins, who observed the profit-seeking paradox, recounted an interview with Admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale was the most senior U.S. naval officer captured by the North Vietnamese and survived repeated torture and beatings before being released after seven years. (He ended his public career sadly as the inept vice-presidential nominee in Ross Perot’s quixotic independent candidacy for the U.S. presidency in 1992.) In Collins’s account, Stockdale described the conditions of his survival. Collins emphasized Stockdale’s determination to see his ordeal through, but also the pragmatism of his responses and… ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1477))

- of how he would survive would have been harmful, not helpful. Stockdale observed that those who died were typically the optimists—those who said to themselves: “We’ll be out by Christmas.” Their spirits were broken by the continual frustration of their hopes. A prisoner of brutal and arbitrary captors, Stockdale had unusually little control of his fate. But accounts similar to the Stockdale paradox are reported by survivors of other extreme experiences. One lesson from these great survivors is the realistic possibility of accomplishing high-level objectives even without knowledge of future states or control over current actions. Roy Jenkins described the issue well: “Clutching at straws is only dangerous if, when they fail to offer support, the wishful thinker abandons resistance and sinks with them.” Jenkins was describing the mood of Winston Churchill after becoming prime minister in 1940.2 After the fall of France, Churchill reiterated his high-level objective for Britain—not just survival but victory. Yet neither Churchill nor any other British leader could have held any realistic conception of how that objective might be achieved.

- Obliquity was forced on Stockdale and Churchill. But it is forced on all of us. The illusion that we have more control over our lives than we possess, that we understand more about the world and the future than we do or can, is pervasive. No position in the modern world carries more power and authority and greater scope to determine the environment within which the holder operates than the presidency of the United States. Surely presidents don’t have to be oblique. But they do. When Stockdale was captured, Lyndon Johnson was president. As Senate majority leader Johnson had been a master of obliquity, displaying Machiavellian aptitude in his ability to handle people and secure agreement.3 But Johnson was trapped into an escalation of errors that divided his country. In turn, Richard Nixon, Johnson’s successor and president when Stockdale was freed, also persisted in a course that compounded error on error until he could escape impeachment only by resignation. Johnson and Nixon both enjoyed great power, yet still they overrated that power. They believed they could engineer a Great Society, or world peace, when in reality they were muddling through. They overestimated their authority and, imagining they were able to control their environment, failed to perceive how far their actions were constrained by their current realities.

- But if a single activity provides an objective test of the quality of personal decisions, it is the process of investment. Successful investment processes are frequently associated with single individuals. Such individuals make identifiable decisions—to buy and sell—frequently. They do so in competition with other people attempting to do more or less the same thing. The two most successful investors of recent times are Warren Buffett—the man who bought 10 percent of Coca-Cola—and George Soros—who sold sterling in sufficient quantity to force the UK out of its shadowing of the European Monetary System. Their success has been sustained over a lengthy period and has continued to be sustained even after their talents have been widely recognized. Both are highly intelligent and articulate men who have written extensively about their approaches and methods. A striking feature of the accounts of both is a certain kind of modesty: their ready acknowledgment of their own ignorance and equally ready admission that they make mistakes. They are not modest in a broader sense—both are proud of their success, and neither is quiet about that success.

- spend years intensely studying these industries. Sometimes our own intellectual shortcomings would stand in the way of understanding, and in other cases the nature of the industry would be the road block.1 Buffett tries to live a life without surprises by confining his attention to a small number of problems he feels able to solve. But politicians and businesspeople rarely have this luxury. Soros, less reticent, recognizes his own ignorance: My financial success stands in stark contrast with my ability to forecast events. In this context, we must distinguish between events in financial markets and events in the real world.... Even in predicting financial markets my record is less than impressive: the best that can be said for it is that my theoretical framework enables me to understand the significance of events as they unfold—although the record is far from spotless. . . . With regard to events in the real world, my record is downright dismal. The outstanding feature of my predictions is that I keep on expecting developments that do not materialize.2 Both Buffett and Soros are decisive in their actions yet eclectic in their thought. In a famous essay, Isaiah Berlin adopted Tolstoy’s distinction between the hedgehog—who knows one big thing—and the fox—who knows many little things. Hedgehogs move slowly and directly, foxes quickly and obliquely. There are important roles for both kinds of attribute. If Roosevelt was a fox, Churchill was a hedgehog, yet both were obviously great leaders: Roosevelt, like Lincoln, steered his country through troubled years, Churchill led his country to victory in its greatest crisis.3 The political scientist Philip Tetlock has used this taxonomy in a long-term study of expert political judgment.4 Over two decades, he invited respondents to predict political events and used hindsight to assess the quality of their responses. The experts were not very good at anticipating the future. No surprise: The world is complex and uncertain; our understanding of it is incomplete. But Tetlock’s most striking discovery is that although the foxes perform better in terms of the quality of their judgments, the hedgehogs perform better in terms of public acclaim. Hedgehogs are people who know the answers. Foxes know the limitations of their knowledge. Hedgehogs create headlines for journalists, and their confident certainties attract the attention of politicians and business leaders. Give me a one-handed economist, goes the saying, but careful judgment really is often a matter of “on the one hand, and on the other.” Yet explicit hedgehogs who claim to predict the future will always attract a larger audience than eclectic foxes who acknowledge they can’t, even if the larger audience learns nothing useful from the predictions.

The intelligence agents who anticipated an attack on the Twin Towers were not praised for their prescience; the risk managers who warned banks of impending nemesis were fired. It is good for reputation to succeed against the odds. But it is often better for reputation to fail against the odds than to improve them. In an uncertain situation the effect of improving the odds is never obvious, either before the event or after it. Captain MacWhirr, limited man though he was, understood that dilemma. Machiavelli, the epitome of the oblique decision maker, was the archetypal fox. Five centuries before Tetlock confirmed it empirically, Machiavelli understood that to be an effective decision maker it was wise not to seek public credit for the success of one’s decisions.

- Computers don’t solve problems the way people solve problems. Today’s computers play chess about as well as humans, but although the formal rules are the same, they are, in a real sense, playing a different game. Computer chess is more direct, grandmaster chess more oblique. People tend to find the grandmaster chess more interesting. There are no footballing computers. However, footballers don’t play football the way computers would play football. David Beckham cannot solve differential equations. He is not only unable to articulate the methods he uses to score goals but apparently ignorant of what they are. Through some oblique process, Beckham has stumbled on the solution to which he would have been led by the—impossible—direct approach, which would have involved a deep understanding of sports engineering and mathematics. Dr. Carré found this difficult to comprehend (as do I) . Yet there is no doubt that Beckham’s skills are real. Few responses seem more direct than the reflex that pulls our hand away from a hot stove. But the process that nature and nurture equipped us with is extraordinarily ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XD40&location=1691))

- oblique. We don’t pull our hand away because the heat will damage our tissue and our bones. We pull our hand away because it hurts. We probably pull our hand away even before it hurts, because we know that it will hurt. If we know the stove is very hot we will not put our hand on it in the first place. If we think about it, we recognize that we will suffer serious injury unless we pull our hand away. But we don’t actually have that thought, and that isn’t why we remove our hand. And yet there is a sense in which it is the potential of tissue damage that leads us to pull away. Pain is an evolved capacity that enables humans, and most other creatures, to avoid or reduce damage to their bodies by forcing them to withdraw from threatening situations. The pain response is sometimes inappropriate. The source of pain may be beneficial—an injection, a lifesaving operation, a visit to the gym. We learn to recognize these anomalies and to develop rules to deal with them: “Accept pain administered by a trusted physician.” “No pain no gain” leads you to persist in a workout. But sometimes we need help. Major surgery is possible only because anesthetic drugs interfere with neural responses. These drugs, which dull our reactions, are dangerous. We should not make important decisions under their influence. If we could master pain reflexes, we could deal directly with decisions about when to pull our hands away from a hot stove and when to allow surgeons to operate on us. We could make decisions on when to risk injury and when not, on the basis of careful calculation and appropriate evidence. Some people make a shot at doing this. Sportsmen and soldiers are trained to ignore pain. They often hurt themselves in consequence. Some people suffer a genetic abnormality in which they do not experience pain, and they generally die young through an accumulation of injuries. Leprosy destroys the nerves that transmit pain, leading to deformity, and historically has been the most feared of all diseases that do not kill. Scientists have constructed machines that simulate the experience of pain for people who do not experience it naturally. No machine is as sensitive as the natural pain response,1 but that is not the principal reason pain machines do not work well.

- Just as Kasparov’s prowess is evidenced by his victories, and Beckham’s by his goals, the expertise of these people is evidenced by their effectiveness and the respect of their colleagues. One of Klein’s experiments involved showing videos of paramedics in action—some novice, some expert—to various groups of observers. He discovered that both experienced paramedics and laypeople were more successful at distinguishing the novices from the professionals than were teachers of paramedic skills.2 Paramedic teachers monitored adherence to the rules they taught and saw such adherence more often in the novices. They looked knowledgeably for directness and could not recognize the success of obliquity from a short video. That doesn’t mean that the teachers were bad teachers or that novice paramedics should not pay close attention to the rules the teachers prescribe.

- question “What set of principles or rules would enable millions of youngsters to bend it like Beckham?” The same message emerges from the biographies or autobiographies of successful businessmen. They (or at least their ghostwriters) are more articulate than Beckham. But like Beckham, they describe their achievements rather than explain them. More long-windedly, they repeat John Paul Getty’s explanation of his business success—“Strike oil.” They do not tell us the secret of their achievements because they do not know. But to say we do not fully understand why people are better than computers at solving so many practical problems or understand why the oblique approach so often outperforms the direct one is not to say we know nothing. Kasparov, Beckham and the paramedics are good at what they do not only because they have exceptional talents but because they have trained and been trained to be good at it over many years. We often describe our response to pain, or actions such as Beckham’s, as intuitive or instinctive. Kasparov’s expertise is intellectual, not physical, and it is less likely though not unusual for us to describe his moves as “instinctive” or “intuitive.” But these descriptions don’t add anything to our knowledge and certainly don’t explain why Beckham, who can’t do the differential equations, is a better footballer than Dr. Carré, who can.
