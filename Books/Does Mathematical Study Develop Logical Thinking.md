## Highlights
- Mathematics should be studied because doing so develops general thinking skills that are useful through life. This position — which has been referred to as the Theory of Formal Discipline (TFD) — has a strong historical pedigree. Plato was an early advocate, and in The Republic wrote that Those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been.9 ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=199))

- it the case that mathematics graduates obtain more or better jobs than their non-mathematical colleagues? The UK’s Higher Education Statistics Agency collects data on such matters. Figure 1.2 shows the percentage of UK graduates from three different disciplines who were working or studying six months after they graduated. On this measure mathematics graduates do not appear to outperform other graduates. However, it may be the case that mathematics graduates tend to earn more than those from many other disciplines. For instance, in 2012 the median salary of UK mathematics graduates from the 2008/9 graduating cohort was £32,000, compared to £23,000 for biological scientists, £27,000 for social studies graduates, and the overall median of ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=329))

- £26,500. In fact, according to these figures, only graduates in medicine and dentistry had higher median salaries than mathematicians.27 ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=334))

- In sum, as with our interviewees, we found strong support for the TFD among recent mathematics graduates. Almost all believed that their mathematical studies had developed skills of problem solving, logical thinking and their ability to adopt an analytical approach; and a large majority endorsed Smith’s formulation of the TFD, and accepted that “mathematical training disciplines the mind, develops logical and critical reasoning, and develops analytical and problem-solving skills to a high degree.” ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=376))

- Tarver and Franklin’s arguments are directly analogous to that made by Locke when he suggested that mathematical study was important, not because it would teach you mathematics, but because it made you a “reasonable creature”. But few subscribe to the TFD today in the context of Latin or chess. Why not? The answer is that during the course of the twentieth century a large body of opinion has built up in the educational psychology community which suggested that the TFD is simply false.34 ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=402))

- The first serious attempt to challenge the TFD came from Edward Thorndike, one of the first educational psychologists, who spent his career at Columbia University’s Teachers College. Born in 1874, Thorndike’s early work was on animal learning; he studied under William James at Harvard and James Cattell at Columbia, and pioneered the study of animal intelligence.35 His work on animal learning led him to formulate the influential ‘Law of Effect’, a precursor of the behaviourist movement in psychology. This law stated that if an animal’s action is followed by a “satisfying state of affairs” in a given situation, then it is more likely to occur in that situation in the future. Equally, if an action is followed by an “annoying state of affairs” it is less likely to occur again. In other ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=406))

- words, responses which lead to positive outcomes are more likely to occur again, and responses which lead to negative outcomes are less likely to. Thorndike also made substantial contributions to statistical methods in psychology, to the nature-nurture debate, and to the development of educational and intelligence tests. He firmly believed that introspective accounts, such as those given by Plato and Locke in the context of the TFD, should be rejected, and instead that the methods of science should be brought to bear on debates which had previously remained outside the domain of empirical data. He wrote that “anything that exists, exists in some amount and can be measured”, and that therefore it ought to be.36 For Thorndike, the TFD was of much wider interest than just mathematics. He described the issue in these terms: The problem of how far the particular responses made day by day by pupils improve their mental powers in general is called the problem of the disciplinary value or disciplinary effect of studies, or more briefly, the problem of formal discipline. How far, for instance, does learning to be accurate with numbers make one more… ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=412))

- in choosing a religious creed or in deciding whether it is best for him to get married? How far does the habit of obedience to a teacher in school generate the habit of obedience to parents, laws and the voice of conscience?37 In The Principles of Teaching, published in 1906, Thorndike set out what he called ‘the common view’, a version of the TFD which suggested that every time a person acquired a new specialist ability it would contribute to a general ability: “Improved attention to grammar or Latin would thus mean an improvement of the power to attend to any task.”38 This common view could, said Thorndike, be shown to be false. He argued that the only way of testing the TFD would be to determine the extent to which training on some specialised skill produced improved performances in other domains. In one classic experiment, Thorndike and his collaborator Robert Woodworth asked a group of adults to estimate the length of a series of long lines. Having taken this benchmark measure, they then trained their participants to estimate the length of short lines. They were… ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=423))

- Woodworth found that their participants had made little or no improvement.39 Similar results were found in other domains: skills at estimating the area of rectangles apparently did not help much with estimating the area of circles or triangles.40 Developing the ability to quickly mark verbs in pages of text did not develop the ability to quickly mark other types of words.41 Students who were encouraged to produce neat schoolwork during their arithmetic classes, showed no such improvement in their language or spelling classes.42 From all these results, Thorndike concluded that the TFD was “much exaggerated” and that it should be abandoned. Instead he suggested that transferring skills from one domain to another, even if closely related, was impossible. If this were correct, the justification for teaching a school subject such as Latin or mathematics could not be based on claims about how it develops general reasoning. Thorndike wrote It is extremely unsafe to teach anything simply because of… ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=434))

- Delving deeper into his data, Thorndike found that the academic subjects which appeared to show the highest gains did so unevenly across the different types of items in his test. So the gains showed by those studying algebra, geometry and trigonometry were very different from the gains showed by those studying Latin or French. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the group who studied mathematical subjects showed greater gains on the parts of the test concerned with numerical operations, and those studying languages showed greater gains on those parts of the test concerned with vocabulary. Thorndike concluded that his findings were consistent with his earlier studies on the ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=487))

- difficulties with transferring abilities between related domains, writing: The superior gains which we have found associated with taking certain studies are then surely not to be regarded as consisting entirely in a general improvement for thinking with all sorts of data.49 Thorndike’s conclusions, and particularly his Law of Effect, greatly contributed to the growing influence of behaviourism in psychology. This school of thought, perhaps most closely identified with the work of B. F. Skinner and John Watson, took the view that thought simply consists of responses to concrete stimuli, and that learning is merely the result of reinforced stimulus-response links. Clearly if learning is merely the consequence of responding to particular stimuli, there is no room for skills to be transferred from one context to another. While a student might be able to learn to reason logically in response to algebraic stimuli, in the presence of different, non-mathematical stimuli, this response would not be activated as the required stimulus-response link was different.

- The task that Wason became most famous for has spawned an enormous literature (which we add to later in the book). It focused on how people reason about so-called conditionals, statements of the form ‘if p then q’. The set up is simple. An experimenter shows the participant four cards, bearing the symbols D, K, 3, and 7. It is known that each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other. The task is to choose just those cards which you need to turn over in order to determine whether the following rule is true or false: “if the letter is D, then the number is 3”.55 The task, which became known as Wason’s selection task, is shown in Figure 1.3. Wason found a result quite inconsistent with Piaget’s view that adults always reason in accordance with logical rules. He discovered that the most common response was for participants to answer that it was necessary to turn over the D and 3 card. But this is not consistent with norms of formal logic: given the rule ‘if D then 3’, the 3 card is irrelevant. If there is a D on its back, then it’s consistent with the rule, and if there isn’t then it’s also consistent because ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=549))

- the rule is only about cards with Ds on. However, the 7 card is important: if it has a D on its reverse, then the rule is falsified. Overall, contrary to Piaget’s expectations, less than 10% of educated adults made the normatively correct selection of D and 7. The infrequency with which people select D and 7 on this task is perhaps one of the most robust findings in the cognitive psychology literature.56 ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=559))

- The selection task has generated an enormous literature, and quite why it is so difficult (and even whether the normatively correct answer should be considered to be the ‘right’ answer at all) has been hotly debated. For instance, some have argued that problems such as the selection task are merely ‘cognitive illusions’ that have no relevance to the real world.57 Others have suggested that while the answer seen as… ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=564))

- selection will yield more information, given certain sensible assumptions.58 We discuss some of these issues in more detail later in the book. For now, however, we report just one other important selection task finding, which is relevant to the issue of transfer of reasoning skills. A few years after introducing the selection task, Wason tried a variant where he replaced the abstract letters and numbers with real-world content. In this version, the rule became “every time I go to Manchester I travel by train” and the cards ‘Manchester’, ‘Leeds’, ‘Train’ and ‘Car’.59 Surprisingly, the majority of participants now made the correct selections: Manchester and Car. Apparently, the way in which adults reason depended on the context in which the reasoning took place. Even structurally identical problems apparently elicited different responses. This was another serious problem for the notion of transfer and the TFD: if reasoning depended so heavily on context, in what sense could one talk about ‘general reasoning skills’? In summary, psychological research for much of the twentieth century has been extremely… ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=568))

- But in the last few decades this consensus has been challenged. In the late 1980s a group of psychologists, led by Richard Nisbett, reexamined the issue and claimed that some kinds of general reasoning skills, which they called ‘pragmatic reasoning schemas’ could be developed through teaching. One of the areas Nisbett concentrated on was statistical reasoning. He gave different groups of students problems such as: Catherine is a manufacturer’s representative. She likes her job, which takes her to cities all over the country. Something of a gourmet, she eats at restaurants that are recommended to her. When she has a particularly excellent meal at a restaurant, she usually goes for a return visit. But she is frequently disappointed. Subsequent meals are rarely as good as the first meal. Why do you suppose this is?60 Nisbett found that participants untrained in statistics would tend to respond by concocting causal hypotheses concerning the restaurant industry’s high turnover of chefs, or Catherine’s unrealistic expectations. In contrast, Nisbett found that those who had received a basic undergraduate… ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=580))

- typically give high-quality statistical answers, and appeal to the phenomenon of regression to the mean.61 One statistical idea Nisbett focused on was the Law of Large Numbers, the idea that as the number of trials in an experiment increases, the average result gets closer to the expected value. The law implies, for example, that the proportion of coin tosses that land heads should be closer to one half when 100 coin tosses take place compared to when there are only 10. In a series of studies, Nisbett and colleagues investigated whether students who received tuition in the law of large numbers were able to apply it to a variety of different contexts. For instance, one of the problems concerned asking students to explain the fact that after the first two weeks of a baseball season the top batter normally has an average of around 0.450, yet no batter has ever completed a season with an average that high. Typical responses to such a question are causal: for instance, a student might hypothesise that after a run of success in the first few weeks pitchers may study the batter’s technique and adjust their tactics. But students who had received training on the law of large numbers were more likely to give a statistical answer, by asserting that two weeks was too short a time to produce an accurate average. As well as increasing the likelihood of giving a… ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=591))

- In this chapter, we have introduced the TFD, and discussed how it is viewed by two very different communities: mathematicians and psychologists. The theory, which has been supported by thinkers as varied as Plato, Locke and Vorderman, suggests that studying mathematics is valuable because it helps students develop skills of logical reasoning and problem solving. Despite the overwhelming support of mathematics graduates for the theory, and its regular appearance in policy reports, the bulk of empirical ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M6YT18H&location=622))
