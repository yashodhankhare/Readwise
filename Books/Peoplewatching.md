## Highlights
- Frequently the human animal is unaware of his actions – which makes them all the more revealing. He concentrates so hard on his words that he seems to forget that his movements, postures and expressions are telling their own story. It should be added, though, that this book is not intended as an aid to dominating one’s companions by reading their secret thoughts. A birdwatcher does not study birds in order to shoot them down. In the same way, a peoplewatcher does not take unfair advantage of his special understanding of human behaviour. True, a proficient, objective observer can utilize his knowledge to transform a boring social occasion into an exciting field-trip, but his primary aim is to come to a deeper understanding of human interactions and of the remarkable predictability of much of human behaviour.

- I have often been asked whether I can train someone to improve their body language. Is it possible, for instance, to convert a shy ditherer into a forceful extrovert, when he or she is facing an important interview for a new appointment? The answer is simple. Yes, of course, lessons can be taught in how to modify one’s body language. A composed sitting posture, incisive gestures, and other details can be drilled into the applicant to make him or her appear more assertive, decisive and impressive than they really are. A few tricks can quickly be learned and in recent years (since the first appearance of Manwatching in 1977) a number of books and agencies have appeared on the scene offering just such services. But what is the point? If the applicant is truly a shy ditherer, he or she will be totally unsuited for the employment which they have tricked themselves into gaining. They will soon be found out and removed. In which case, it is fair to ask, what is the practical advantage of gaining a better understanding of human body language? The answer lies in the self-confidence that is gained by the knowledge acquired. The more we know about the body language of other people, the more human they seem. They are no longer frightening figures that make us feel awkward in their presence. They may have become expert at concealing their weaknesses and insecurities, but our knowledge of the finer details of their body language will reveal them to us in all their human frailty. Being less intimidated, our own body language will start to change. We will feel more relaxed and assured, not because we have learned a few superficial tricks, but because we have come to understand other people so much better.

- Finally, it must be stressed that there is nothing insulting about looking at people as animals. We are animals, after all. Homo sapiens is a species of primate, a biological phenomenon dominated by biological rules, like any other species. Human nature is no more than one particular kind of animal nature. Agreed, the human species is an extraordinary animal; but all other species are also extraordinary animals, each in their own way, and the scientific peoplewatcher… ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=214))

- Yet this is what people do, tacitly accepting the irresistible need to express themselves in simple bodily actions. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=237))

- What form do these actions take, and how are they acquired by each individual? Human behaviour is not free-flowing; it is divided up into a long series of separate events. Each event, such as eating a meal, visiting a theatre, taking a bath, or making love, has its own special rules and rhythms. Between our birthday and our deathday we can expect to pass through a total of over a million such behaviour events. Each of these events is itself subdivided into numerous distinct acts. Basically these acts follow one another in a sequence of posture-movement-posture-movement. Most of the postures we adopt and the movements we make we have made thousands of times before. Most of them are performed unconsciously, spontaneously and without self-analysis. In many cases they are so familiar, so much taken for granted, that we do not even know how we do them. For example, when people interlock their fingers, one thumb rests on top of the other. For each person there is a dominant thumb in this action and whenever left and right hand interlock, the same thumb rests uppermost. Yet hardly anyone can guess which is their dominant thumb without going through the motions of interlocking their hands and looking to see which thumb comes out on top. Over the years, each person has developed a fixed pattern of interlocking without realizing it. If they try to reverse the positions, bringing the dominant thumb beneath the other, the hand posture will feel strange and awkward.

- Against this and in support of the idea that, as it was recently expressed, ‘man is pre-programmed to a decisive extent’, is put the observation that cultures are not as different as they seem. If you look for differences you will find them, but if you look for similarities you will find plenty of those, too. Unfortunately the natural inclination has been to notice the differences and overlook the similarities. It is rather like a tourist visiting a foreign ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=264))

- country. He is impressed by the many unfamiliar elements he encounters and ignores the many familiar ones. This very understandable bias has also influenced much of the fieldwork carried out by anthropologists in the past. The often striking, superficial variations in social behaviour have been mistaken for fundamental differences. These are the two conflicting views. Since no one is arguing about the fact that we do learn a great deal during our lives, the debate must concentrate on those particular actions which are claimed to be inborn. How does an inborn action work? Essentially the idea is that the brain is programmed, rather like a computer, to link particular reactions with specific stimuli. The stimulus input triggers off the reaction output without any prior experience – it is preplanned and operates successfully the very first time you encounter the stimulus. The classic example is the newborn baby reacting immediately to its mother’s nipple by sucking. A number of infantile reactions seem to be of this type and are clearly essential to survival. There is no time to learn. But what about actions that appear later on, when there has already been ample time for learning to have taken place? How about smiling and frowning? Does the young child copy these from its mother, or are they, too, inborn? Only a child that has never seen its mother can provide the answer. If we look at children born blind and deaf we find that they do indeed show smiling and frowning at appropriate moments in their daily lives. They also cry even though they cannot hear themselves doing so. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=267))

- Some intrepid research workers have scoured the globe for remote tribes in an attempt to answer this point and have been able to confirm that even Amazonian Indians who have never met white men before do indeed perform many small actions precisely as we do. But does this really prove that the actions are inborn? If remote tribesmen flash their eyebrows in greeting like we do, and like everyone else does, can we be sure that this means the reaction must be ‘built in’ to our brains before birth?

- Our Discovered Actions are unconsciously acquired as we get to know our bodies during the long process of growing up. We are not even aware of their addition to our childhood repertoire and in most cases we have no idea precisely how we perform them – which arm crosses over which, or which way our hands move as we speak.

- As a species we are strongly imitative and it is impossible for a healthy individual to grow up and live in a community without becoming infected with its typical action-patterns. The way we walk and stand, laugh and grimace, are all subject to this influence. Many actions are first performed solely because we have observed them in our companions’ behaviour. It is difficult to recognize this in your own behaviour, because the process of absorption is so subtle and you are seldom aware that it has happened, but it is easy to detect in minority groups within your own society.

- These, then, are the four ways in which we acquire actions: by genetic inheritance, by personal discovery, by social absorption, and by deliberate training. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=454))

- Discovered Actions are frequently influenced in the same way, being strongly modified by the unconscious emulation of social fashions. Sitting with the legs crossed, for instance, may be privately discovered as a pleasing, convenient posture, but the exact form it takes will soon come under the influence of unwritten social rules. Without realizing it, children, as they grow older, start crossing their legs like other members of their own sex, class, age-group and culture. This will happen almost unnoticed. Even when it is noticed, it will probably not be analysed or understood. A member of one group, mixing with another, will feel ill at ease without realizing why. The reason will be because the others are moving, posturing and gesticulating in an alien manner. The differences may be subtle, but they will be detectable and will register. A member of one group can be heard referring to another group as lazy ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=459))

- or effeminate or rough. When asked why, he will reply: ‘You’ve only got to look at them.’ The chances are that he is unconsciously misreading their actions. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=465))

- To continue with the example of leg-crossing – certain American males have been reported as saying that they find European males slightly effeminate. When this reaction is analysed it turns out to have nothing to do with the sexual behaviour of European males, but rather with the fact that they often sit with one knee crossed over the other knee. To the European this is such a normal posture that he cannot even see it as a posture. It is just a natural way to sit. But to the American male it appears effeminate because, at home, it is more often performed by his female than his male companions. The American male prefers – if he is going to cross his legs – to perform the ankle-knee cross, in which the ankle of one leg rests high up across the knee of the other leg. A valid objection to this observation could be that many European males often adopt the ankle-knee cross posture and that American males, especially those from major cities, can sometimes be seen sitting with one knee crossed over the other. This is true, but it only underlines the sensitivity of the unconscious reactions people give to the behaviour of their companions. The difference is only a matter of degree. More European males happen to behave in the one way, more Americans in the other. And yet this minor difference is enough to give a visiting American a distinct feeling that European males are in some way effeminate.

- A GESTURE IS any action that sends a visual signal to an onlooker. To become a gesture, an act has to be seen by someone else and has to communicate some piece of information to them. It can do this either because the gesturer deliberately sets out to send a signal – as when he waves his hand – or it can do it only incidentally – as when he sneezes. The hand-wave is a Primary Gesture, because it has no other existence or function. It is a piece of communication from start to finish. The sneeze, by contrast, is a secondary, or Incidental Gesture. Its primary function is mechanical and is concerned with the sneezer’s personal breathing problem. In its secondary role, however, it cannot help but transmit a message to his companions, warning them that he may have caught a cold. Most people tend to limit their use of the term ‘gesture’ to the primary form – the hand-wave type – but this misses an important point. What matters with gesturing is not what signals we think we are sending out, but what signals are being received. The observers of our acts will make no distinction between our intentional Primary Gestures and our unintentional, incidental ones. In some ways, our Incidental Gestures are the more illuminating of the two, if only for the very fact that we do not think of them as gestures, and therefore do not censor and manipulate them so strictly. This is why it is preferable to use the term ‘gesture’ in its wider meaning as an ‘observed action’. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=508))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A convenient way to distinguish between Incidental and Primary Gestures is to ask the question: Would I do it if I were completely alone? If the answer is No, then it is a Primary Gesture. We do not wave, wink, or point when we are by ourselves; not, that is, unless we have reached the unusual condition of talking animatedly to ourselves.

- So we are faced with two basic problems where Symbolic Gestures are concerned: either one meaning may be signalled by different actions, or several meanings may be signalled by the same action, as we move from culture to culture. The only solution is to approach each culture with an open mind and learn their Symbolic Gestures as one would their vocabulary. As part of this process, it helps if a link can be found between the action and the meaning, but this is not always possible. In some cases we simply do not know how certain Symbolic Gestures arose. It is clear that they are symbolic because they now represent some abstract quality, but how they first acquired the link between action and meaning has been lost somewhere in their long history. A good instance of this is the ‘cuckold’ sign from Italy. This consists of making a pair of horns, either with two forefingers held at the temples, or with a forefinger and little finger of one hand held in front of the body. There is little doubt about what the fingers are meant to be: they are the horns of a bull. As such, they would rate as part of a Schematic Gesture. But they do not send out the simple message ‘bull’. Instead they now indicate sexual betrayal. The action is therefore a Symbolic Gesture and, in order to explain it, it becomes necessary to find the link between bulls and sexual betrayal. Historically, the link appears to be lost, with the result that some rather wild speculations have been made. A complication arises in the form of the ‘horned hand’, also common in Italy, which has a totally different significance, even though it employs the same motif of bull’s horns. The horned hand is essentially a protective gesture, made to ward off imagined dangers. Here it is clear enough that it is the bull’s great power, ferocity and masculinity that is being invoked as a symbolic aid to protect the gesturer. But this only makes it even more difficult to explain the other use of the bull’s horns gesture as a sign of a ‘pathetic’ cuckold. A suggested explanation of this contradiction is that it is due to one gesture using as its starting point the bull’s power, while the other – the cuckold sign – selects the bull’s frequent castration. Since the domestication of cattle began, there have always been too many bulls in relation to cows. A good, uncastrated bull can serve between fifty and one hundred cows a year, so that it is only necessary to retain a small proportion of intact bulls for breeding purposes. The rest are rendered much more docile and easy to handle for beef production, by castration. In folklore, then, these impotent males must stand ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=676))

- helplessly by, while the few sexually active bulls ‘steal their rightful females’; hence the symbolism of: bull = cuckold. A completely different explanation once offered was that, when the cuckold discovers that his wife has betrayed him, he becomes so enraged and jealous that he bellows and rushes violently about like a ‘mad bull’. Another interpretation sees the horn sign as representing the virility of the lover who has cuckolded the husband. Making the sign at the husband reminds him of the way the lover has rutted, like a great bull, with his wife. Yet another explanation is that the hand-sign is essentially sarcastic, carrying the ironic message ‘what a great bull you are’, but meaning the precise opposite. A more classical interpretation involves Diana the Huntress, who made horns into a symbol of male downfall. Actaeon, another hunter, is said to have sneaked a look at her naked body when she was bathing. This so angered her that she turned him into a horned beast and set his own hounds upon him, who promptly killed and ate him. Alternatively, there is the version dealing with ancient religious prostitutes. These ladies worshipped gods who wore ‘horns of honour’ – that is, horns in their other role as symbols of power and masculinity – and the gods were so pleased with the wives who became sacred whores that they transferred their godly horns on to the heads of the husbands who had ordered their women to act in this role. In this way, the horns of honour became the horns of ridicule. As if this were not enough, it is also claimed elsewhere, and with equal conviction, that because stags have horns (antlers were often called horns in earlier periods) and because most stags in the rutting season lose their females to a few ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=695))

- dominant males who round up large harems, the majority of ‘horned’ deer are unhappy ‘cuckolds’. Finally, there is the bizarre interpretation that bulls and deer have nothing to do with it. Instead, it is thought that the ancient practice of grafting the spurs of a castrated cockerel on to the root of its excised comb, where they apparently grew and became ‘horns’, is the origin of the symbolic link between horns and cuckolds. This claim is backed up by the fact that the German equivalent word for ‘cuckold’ hahnrei originally meant ‘capon’. If, after reading these eight rival claims, you feel that all you have really learned is the meaning of the phrase ‘cock-and-bull story’, you can be forgiven. Clearly, we are in the realm of fertile imagination rather than historical record. But this example has been dealt with at length to show how,… ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=709))

- Firemen, crane-drivers, airport-tarmac signalmen, gambling-casino croupiers, dealers at auctions, and restaurant staff, all have their own special Technical Gestures. Either because they must keep quiet, must be discreet, or cannot be heard, they develop their own sets of signals. The rest of us can ignore them, unless we, too, wish to enter their specialized spheres. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=768))

- The most important example is the Deaf-and-dumb Sign Language of hand signals, of which there is both a one-handed and a two-handed version. Also, there is the Semaphore Language of arm signals, and the Tic-tac Language of the racecourse. These all require considerable skill and training and belong in a totally different world from the familiar gestures we employ in everyday life. They serve as a valuable reminder, though, of the incredibly sensitive potential we all possess for visual communication. It makes it all the more plausible to argue that we are all of us responding, with greater sensitivity than we may realize, to the ordinary gestures we witness each day of our lives.

- GESTURES, BY DEFINITION, transmit signals, and these signals must come across clearly if we are to understand their messages. They cannot afford to be vague and woolly; they must be crisp and sharp and difficult to confuse with other signals. To do this they have to develop a ‘typical form’ that shows comparatively little variation. And they must be performed with a ‘typical intensity’, showing much the same speed, strength and amplitude on each occasion that they are brought into action. It is rather like the ringing of a telephone bell. The signal goes on sounding at fixed intervals, at a fixed volume, and with a fixed sound, no matter how urgent the call. The telephone system treats a casual call in just the same way as one that happens to be a matter of life and death. The only difference it permits is the length of the ringing, before the caller gives up. This may seem inefficient, and one sometimes longs for a telephone bell that gets louder and louder, with increasing urgency. But the rigidity of the ringing tone is important in one major respect – it reduces ambiguity. No one confuses a telephone bell with a front-door bell or an alarm clock. Its fixed form and its fixed intensity make it unmistakable. This process is at work in human gestures. They can never hope to perfect a completely fixed intensity, like the bell, but they can and do achieve something approximating it in many ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=792))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There is another type of Gesture Variant, and that is the one that exists because a particular gesture is rather rare and is unlikely to be confused with any other gesture. It fails to develop a typical form, through lack of use and lack of ambiguity. A good example is the Italian Ear Touch. This gesture always has the same meaning throughout Italy: it is a sign that someone, a male, is considered to be effeminate or homosexual. It occurs infrequently and there are no other ear-touching gestures with which it can be confused. The result is that it lacks a typical form. The ear can be pulled, tugged, flipped, flicked or merely touched, and yet the message is always the same. The observer is not confused by these variations, as he might be with other gestures that have close similarities with one another. There is no pressure on the gesturer to narrow the action down to a precise movement. The gesture owes its origin, incidentally, to the fact that women wear earrings, the gesture representing the touching of an imaginary ear ornament and therefore implying a female trait.

- JUST AS ONE gesture can have many different meanings, so can many different gestures have the same meaning.

- There are many other gestures that signify female beauty, but this selection suffices to make the point that a message as basic as the male’s response to feminine appeal will inevitably find a wide variety of forms of expression, both within cultures and between them.

- A HYBRID GESTURE is one that combines two separate gestures, with distinct origins, in a single action. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A0JJVBU&location=951))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A COMPOUND GESTURE is one that is made up of a number of separate elements, each of which has at least some degree of independence. Many human gestures have only one element. If a man is busy working at his desk and someone asks him if the work is going well, he may answer by giving a thumb-up sign. He can do this without looking up and without pausing in his work. He merely extends a hand with the thumb raised. The rest of his body contributes nothing, and yet the message is understood. This is a simple gesture and it contrasts sharply with more complex ones involving related but discrete features. Human laughter, or, rather, what happens when a man laughs, is a good example of a Compound Gesture. When the display occurs at its very highest intensity, the laugher simultaneously: (1) emits a hooting or barking sound; (2) opens his mouth wide; (3) pulls back his mouth-corners; (4) wrinkles up his nose; (5) closes his eyes; (6) shows crinkle lines at the outer corners of his eyes; (7) weeps; (8) throws back his head; (9) raises his shoulders; (10) rolls his trunk about; (11) clasps his body; and (12) stamps his foot. Whenever you observe someone laughing, it should be possible to score them on this 12-point scale. Extreme scores are rare. It is possible to score only one point – by laughing with the mouth shut and with the body immobile – and it is possible to score a full 12 – as with uncontrollable, cheek-streaming belly-laughter. But it is much more common to observe a middle-range laugh of about 6 to 8 points. These will not always be the same elements. Even the laughing sound itself can be omitted – think of silent laughter or a picture of a laughing man – and yet the message of the display still comes across.
