- Logically, we know that doing the last thing first—asking a financial advisor for a solution before identifying the problem—makes no sense, yet that’s where the traditional financial services industry would have us start: at the end.

- Here, Tugend quotes Stanford health psychologist and lecturer Kelly McGonigal: Brain scans, [McGonigal] said, have shown that there are regions of the brain that activate when we think about other people, and other regions that activate when we think about ourselves. In cases where people don’t feel much connection to their future selves, the areas of the brain that light up when they are asked to think about themselves in the future are—guess what?—the same ones as when they think about other people.”1...

- Now, instead of buying immediately, I keep items in my shopping cart for 72 hours before I hit the checkout button. I was amazed at how quickly this changed my habit. Most of the time, the stuff sits in my cart for a lot longer than 72 hours, and I forget about it altogether.

- Over the years, I’ve discovered that figuring out what’s most important about money can require taking a hard look at the difference between what we need and what we think we need. For many of us, this process will require a rethinking of our definition of “need.” In a world where things we once considered luxuries have somehow become necessities, it can be difficult to separate needs from wants. Achieving clarity about the difference between the two may prove to be one of the biggest ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NCLPGN0&location=1164))

- On the whole, the financial press isn’t so keen on stories of people who’ve made sound investment decisions over four decades, paid down their debt, created a diversified portfolio, and reached their retirement goals on time or even a little ahead of schedule. Those stories don’t sell magazines or have a very high click-through rate. No, the stories we hear most frequently are those of the ultrarich whose investment strategies ([Location 1519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NCLPGN0&location=1519))
