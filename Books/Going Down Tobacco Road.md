- This is by no means a complete history of RJR. For those who want to learn more, I recommend two books: The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company by Nannie M. Tilley, published in 1985, is an authorized and detailed history of the company from its beginning in 1875 through 1963. Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, published in 1989 and again in 2009 with an update, was a New York Times best seller, and it is a fascinating account of the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout, detailing all the lunacy that greed can inspire. Both are thoroughly researched and weave a rich tapestry about an iconic American company. My effort does not come close to what these authors accomplished, but I hope it will fill some gaps in the story, clarify events surrounding the sale and breakup of RJR, and give some lessons worth remembering.

- Tobacco exports grew rapidly in the Tidewater region of Virginia and in Maryland, and the crop became the major export from the colonies to England. Tobacco was so important to the economy of those two colonies that, for two hundred years, it was used as currency, valued more than money. (Refer to the website post WP I.01—Jean Nicot.)

- Despite this resistance, tobacco became a universal product. It was very popular in China, where everyone smoked, reportedly even small children. Governments soon saw that tobacco was a valuable tax generator, a path they have followed down to today. Politicians remain ambivalent about tobacco—a balance between its health hazards for their constituents and a tremendous source of tax revenue.

- Tobacco planters in the colonies had a strong hand in the Revolutionary War. By the mid-1700s, tobacco was widely accepted as legal tender. To finance the war, Benjamin Franklin negotiated loans with the French using tobacco as collateral. (Refer to the website post WP I.02—Tobacco and the American Revolution.)

- Smoking slowly replaced chewing as the tobacco product of choice. America’s transformation from a rural to an urban society accelerated this change. As population density increased, spitting tobacco juice became unacceptable; in addition to being unsightly, the public began to associate spitting with the spread of tuberculosis and other diseases.

- In 1880, manufacturers in North Carolina produced 2 million hand-rolled cigarettes. Large manufacturers tried to mechanize the rolling process with little success. In 1884, James Albert Bonsack invented a machine that mechanized making cigarettes. It took several years to develop the machine’s commercial capability, but it revolutionized the industry.

- From the American Tobacco Trust, five companies emerged: R. J. Reynolds, American, Lorillard, Liggett & Myers, and British American. Now independent competitors, they would be the industry leaders for decades. In 1900, North Carolina produced 128 million pounds of tobacco, which increased to 380 million pounds by 1925. In 1920, Winston-Salem and Durham factories produced 20 percent of all U.S. tobacco products. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=275))

- In 1920, large farms still produced most of the tobacco. Smaller farms could be profitable, but sharecropping and tenant farming were common with people who had no land. They paid part of each year’s crop as “rent” to large landowners. As late as 1923, nearly half of the state’s farmers were tenants. Like most farmers, tobacco growers suffered from cycles of overproduction and low prices. But the Great ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=280))

- Depression hit farm prices especially hard. Twenty-five percent of North Carolina families were on government “relief.” Farmers compensated for lower prices by producing more tobacco, leading to even lower prices. President Roosevelt noted their economic troubles and created his 1938 Tobacco Program to include them in the “New Deal” for the American people.

- Because of the time and place where I was born and raised, tobacco has been good to me. Having said that, if I were king of the world, I would outlaw it. It’s a bad product. I don’t use it, and I don’t think others should. But I would also outlaw, among other things, hard liquor, fast food, soft drinks, SUVs, and big-time college sports. I don’t approve of them either. With that list of banned products, I doubt there’d be much support for me to be king. And even with royal authority to banish tobacco, if history is any guide, the subjects would defy a royal decree. Tsar Alexis of Russia waged the first government anti-tobacco campaign in 1634: Penalties for Smoking First offense: Whipping, a slit nose, and transport to Siberia Second offense: Execution He obviously didn’t have much success, and current regimes aren’t having much luck either. The main reason for their failure is no secret, but hardly ever mentioned: What else? Money. The industry makes money for so many people that the world in general, and governments in particular, refuse to kill it.

- remained provincial, unadventurous, with a management who liked to stay close to home. Ownership also remained “down home.” The “A” stock assured that employees owned much of the company. It would be well into the 1950s before the board had an outside director. RJR’s management could be forgiven its complacency. Camel was riding a crest of popularity and profitability that few products had ever enjoyed. Cigarettes were almost five times as profitable as any other item on store shelves. An extreme example of this was a well-located drugstore in New York in 1949. The local cigarette salesman restocked it daily, and with an average inventory of $155, the store had annual cigarette sales of $36,450, an inventory turn of two hundred times a year. Nationwide, cigarettes yielded ten times the profit per square foot of any other supermarket item. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=731))

- John Whitaker’s far-sighted leadership contributed much to RJR, but the issue of smoking and health soon overshadowed the strides he had made. This threat to the industry would rear its head in Mr. Whitaker’s last year. Management, aware of the health issue, had formed a committee to study investments in domestic non-tobacco ventures and in international tobacco, but cigarette sales remained high and, with RJR’s dominant market share, diversification had hardly moved beyond the discussion stage.

- John Helyar gave me a moment of fame on the last page of Barbarians at the Gate. He quoted my offhand comment, made while my wife and I were having dinner with him as he researched the historic leveraged buyout: “If Ross Johnson hadn’t existed, it would have been necessary for Wall Street to invent him.” John replied, “That’s a great line, and I’m going to use it in my book.” I forgot the conversation until I read his book. I believed then, and still do, that RJR’s downfall began about 1960. Management made strategic decisions that eventually left the company vulnerable to a takeover. The right time for a buyout arrived in the late 1980s, and Ross was only the catalyst; it likely would have happened anyway. Wall Street investment bankers were taking over companies all over America, and they saw RJR as a golden opportunity, at that time the largest ever—a ripe plum too tempting to resist. Even while expanding the empire worldwide, RJR was sowing the seeds of its own destruction. In 1960, its eighty-fifth year, RJR began to flex its rapidly developing financial muscles in ventures outside tobacco. Cigarette companies were a cornucopia whose cash attracted investors—and corporate raiders—like bears looking for honey. Tobacco was, and is, unique. Why did tobacco profitability exceed that of any other industry for over a hundred years? Did unique circumstances give tobacco an advantage? Michael Porter answered these questions in the Harvard Business Review. Porter’s Five Forces define the attractiveness of an industry: the threat of new competitors, the threat of substitute products, low customer bargaining power, suppliers’ bargaining power, and competitive rivalry. The cigarette industry consisted of a few giant companies, and it ranked unusually high on all these factors. It had products that consumers loved, it paid its workers more, and it had high return on equity. (Refer to the website post WP II.01—Porter’s Five Forces.)

- In 1970, when RJR bought Aminoil (American Independent Oil), a small, independent oil company with a major interest in Kuwait, Charlie Wade said, probably tongue-in-cheek, “What on earth do the bunch of us down on Fourth and Main in Winston-Salem know about oil in Kuwait, where they’ve got all kinds of intrigue and eat goat?” Wade certainly knew better, but his comment reflected local thinking. Most would have been hard pressed to locate Kuwait on a map. As a personal testimony, as late as 1989, I had little idea where Yemen was; I had only the vague notion it was somewhere in the Middle East. RJR figured out that there was more to Kuwait than intrigue and goat meat, but the Aminoil people in New York still had communication problems with the tobacco people in Winston-Salem. At one meeting, the CEO of Aminoil, Jack Sunderland, brought his exploration team for a presentation to RJR senior management about an opportunity in U.S. oil and gas exploration. They wanted to join a pool of oil companies drilling a well offshore of California. Aminoil was to be a minor investor, with ownership of only a few percent. As was common in the “oil patch,” there was a lead company, Standard Oil, and several other participants to limit the risk when drilling an exploratory well. I was at this meeting because I was a liaison between the parent company and the Aminoil subsidiary, there to be seen and not heard. But the opportunity to observe the interplay between the two groups was instructive. The oil people had maps and data, but the tobacco people (including me) had little idea of what they were talking about. They requested a million dollars or less, but the tobacco people agonized over this. These men would spend $50 million on a new plant or a half billion on tobacco inventory without batting an eye but couldn’t readily commit to this small amount for oil. One asked, “With the offshore drilling site outside the continental U.S., what recourse do we have if a foreign power seizes our drilling rig?” This was a well-meant question, but it seemed naive. We would be depending on Standard Oil’s expertise, and I figured they knew enough not to put the rig at risk to piracy. They had been dealing with international oil issues longer than RJR had been making cigarettes. Besides, exactly what foreign power did he have in mind? Was Russia or China or perhaps New Zealand going to attempt to take our rig? It would be just off the coast of San Diego where a naval fleet stood ready to repel any such pirate. Dave Peoples, our CFO, a very practical man, turned his head and gave me a wink. We Like It in America While the broad world market should have been important to RJR, it was the international tobacco business where inaction did the most damage. The company continued to focus on its U.S. interests while Philip Morris charged ahead worldwide. With hindsight, it is easy to fault the tobacco people for their stewardship, but they sat atop one of the most profitable companies… ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1041))

- To understand the tobacco dilemma, one must appreciate the forces pressuring the industry. Two landmark studies in 1950 showed a strong link between smoking and lung cancer, but these early findings hardly altered the habits of smokers. A decade later, Wall Street still believed cigarette stocks had a bright future, and security analysts labeled them “growth” stocks. Industry leadership could be forgiven for failing to recognize the serious threat to their growth. Managements had reason to believe that history was on their side. Government authorities had discouraged tobacco use for more than three hundred years without success, and tobacco continued to flourish despite attempts by various groups to stamp out the “evil weed.” Nevertheless, this warning shot across the bow of the industry opened a seventy-year war that is still being fought, although the outcome is likely to be the end of cigarettes as we know them.

- Bill Lybrook, corporate secretary and a great nephew of R. J. Reynolds, was a board member when management developed a new long-range strategy. Bill told me that he distinctly remembered a board meeting where they discussed alternatives to tobacco. With the threat that government’s smoking and health policy might make cigarettes illegal, RJR faced a big decision: They could either sell different products in the same markets they had been serving, or they could take the same products to new markets. They feared the health issue, and they opted for the prudent route of diversifying away from tobacco, but with much soul-searching. This decision shaped the company for years to come. Without realizing it, RJR had reached an inflection point. In 1960, a diversification committee studied opportunities to redeploy cigarette profits. RJR initially set out to buy consumer-product companies. Management believed that since they could successfully sell cigarettes despite the negative image of them, then they should be able to market any consumer item. This theory was tested many times over the next several years and, unfortunately, nearly always came up short in practice. While RJR made its strategic decision on new products in existing markets, Philip Morris came to a different conclusion. As a Philip Morris executive said in 1987, “The management of this company always had a more abiding faith in the future of tobacco than RJR did.” Their faith paid off. (There’s more on Philip Morris in Part 6.) Over the next twenty-eight years, RJR would expand into seven different industries. Each of these “imaginative experiments” deserves its own story of success, failure, and sometimes corporate intrigue. I will tell their stories in some detail, but before I do, I will lay out a broad perspective on that twenty-eight years, as follows.

- In 1963, Camel celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. That same year, RJR made a major diversification, Pacific Hawaiian, the first of several food companies it would buy. Pacific Hawaiian’s primary product was the popular Hawaiian Punch fruit beverage. The purchase served notice that the company was serious about diversification. The decision to move into non-tobacco businesses looked even better as pressure mounted on the cigarette business. In 1964, the Surgeon General’s critical report linked smoking with lung cancer and heart disease. Tobacco leaders now knew that the industry faced a challenge to its very survival. RJR emphasized its non-tobacco business in 1965. Archer Aluminum announced two new plants in Tennessee, and RJR made a bigger commitment to the food business, buying Penick & Ford in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Following the Surgeon General’s report and health warnings on cigarette packs, sales began to reflect smokers’ concerns. In 1966, RJR’s domestic tobacco sales posted a record annual decline. With international sales showing promise, now at 24 percent of U.S. sales, RJR opened an international tobacco office in Geneva. In 1963 to 1966, RJR bought Filler, a snack foods maker in Atlanta, Georgia, and Chun King Chinese foods in Duluth, Minnesota. RJR Tobacco formed RJR Foods, headquartered in New York City, and consolidated all food operations. Under Sam Angotti’s leadership, Archer began to rationalize its operations into a leaner, more ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1131))

- competitive division with a focus on new markets for aluminum and packaging products. Diversification continued in 1967. The Archer Aluminum Division became Archer Products, Inc., separate from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco. RJR bought three companies that emphasized non-tobacco: Filmco, a maker of industrial plastic film; Coronation Foods in Montreal, Canada; and Patio Foods in San Antonio, Texas, a producer of Mexican-style prepared foods. Tobacco unit sales in the United States continued to decline, although operating earnings from tobacco grew as price increases offset the volume decline. In contrast, international unit volume increased. Much of this growth was related to the Vietnam War and military demand. A corporate development center worked with research on ideas from tobacco, packaging, and foods. The center also had a mechanical development department to license internal tobacco innovations to other cigarette manufacturers. RJR Tobacco created an international division in Winston-Salem to manage its growing cigarette export business. While the profit margins for international sales were not as high as domestic sales, international was still desirable business, and it was growing, in contrast to a stagnant domestic market.

- By 1970, domestic tobacco sales and profits had rebounded from the slump that had followed the Surgeon General’s 1964 report, even though cigarette television advertising was banned at year end. The ban, while seen as damaging to the industry, was a blessing for the cigarette companies. It saved these companies hundreds of millions of advertising dollars that flowed to earnings.

- In his first full year as the head of RJR, Tylee Wilson continued to shape the company into a worldwide consumer goods giant. As his biggest accomplishment, Wilson made the stunning purchase of Nabisco Brands. This deal capped years of effort to build RJR Foods. Nabisco looked like a good fit, and the acquisition earned praise for Wilson as a shrewd dealmaker, vaulting RJR into the ranks of the world’s most prestigious consumer goods companies. However, with the deal came Ross Johnson, Nabisco’s CEO. He was shrewd and skillful at corporate politics. Ty Wilson had bought a powerhouse of cookies, crackers, and other goodies, but he had also unknowingly bought himself a world of trouble with Ross Johnson, and he would find that out soon enough. Simultaneously, Wilson pursued a secret tobacco project—a revolutionary smokeless cigarette. He kept his cards close to his vest, fearing a premature public announcement. He was so secretive that even his board was unaware of the project. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1255))

- end; the empire would come crashing down fourteen months later. Before I address the second wave of barbarians and the collapse, in the upcoming chapters, I will retrace our steps and look in detail at some of those “imaginative experiments,” RJR’s acquisitions, a cautionary tale about mistakes that contributed to the collapse. Then we will discuss the final days of the empire from August 1986 through 1988, when the RJR holdovers in the company must have felt that they had gone through Alice’s looking glass and were in Wonderland, so different was everything from the way it had always been. The winding path RJR traveled from 1960 to 1986 is not easy to follow. The other businesses RJR sought to incorporate into itself had unique characteristics, and it is difficult to blend them into a simple narrative. If I were to lay out the path in chronological order, the activity in any given year would be hard to follow. Therefore, we will look at each business’s history, when it became part of the RJR family, and how it separated from RJR, if it did. I’ll provide a financial scorecard for each one. Some of the seven stories have a happy ending. Others do not. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1274))

- On April 1, 1970, tobacco advertising was banned from radio and television beginning in 1971. The year before the ban, cigarettes were the biggest television advertisers, spending $230 million. Now they would be limited to print media. An era had ended. Removing the ads from the air affected Americans’ smoking not at all. The ban had a surprising positive effect on the cigarette companies’ finances. Without television advertising, it would be nearly impossible for a new company to enter the business; even an existing company found it challenging to introduce a new brand. And since the companies all quit advertising at the same time, existing brands’ market share were not relatively disadvantaged. Also of great help, this retreat from advertising reduced the anti-smoking advertisements on television as well.

- In 1972, Dr. Claude Teague, an RJR research chemist, wrote: “Thus, a tobacco product is, in essence, a vehicle for the delivery of nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and attractive form. Our industry is then based upon design, manufacture and sales of attractive dosage forms of nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or intangible, to the consumer than those of our competitors.”9 While generally unnoticed outside R&D, and not particularly controversial at the time, years later, this memo would be a major point of interest in congressional hearings on tobacco and health.

- The cigarette companies needed political allies, so in 1978, they turned to the one large group who would make common cause with them: the tobacco farmers. RJR joined an industry effort called “Pride in Tobacco.” The 1978 Annual Report declared it to be “highly successful in generating support—from small farms to governors’ mansions—from the people whose way of life depended on this crop every year.”13 ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1379))

- The industry was not totally displeased with higher taxes on cigarettes. Tobacco people knew that the more governments relied on tobacco revenue, the less likely that they would discourage cigarette sales. For decades to come, many would seek to fill their coffers with tobacco money while also condemning smoking, a love-hate relationship fostered by obscene amounts of cash.

- Still, no matter how hard they worked to promote their products, the tide was turning, and Americans were breaking their long love affair with cigarettes. The percentage of Americans who smoked peaked as early as 1950 at close to 50 percent. Even then, reports were beginning to warn about the health dangers in smoking. (See chart below.)

- smoked, but the rejection of the cigarette began to gain momentum. As Americans became more health conscious, they began to ostracize those who continued to smoke. RJR also had a demographic problem. Its big brands were popular with older smokers but were not attracting new, younger customers. Winston and Salem, the flagship brands for the last thirty years, were suffering, and in 1984, Camel, once America’s most popular cigarette, had only a 4.4 percent market share. RJR Tobacco continued to rack up extraordinary profits. More attention to brand positioning stabilized the market share and prices increased steadily even as demand fell. But beyond these improvements, a major contributor to profit growth was the Tobaccoville plant that came onstream in 1986. The annual report proudly noted: “With more than two million square feet of manufacturing space under a twenty-seven-acre roof, Tobaccoville is the world’s largest and most modern cigarette factory.

- Profits Were Great, But the Marlboro Cowboy Remained a Threat In 1987, the tobacco industry reported a return on equity (ROE) of well over 15 percent, twice the average for corporate America. But the tobacco companies invested in other businesses, none of which had the profitability of tobacco. Their annual reports showed blended results of all their business enterprises. Typically, RJR did not give detailed data by business. Reynolds Tobacco’s profitability after the Tobaccoville plant came onstream was an unheard of return on equity above 20 percent. This return is based on the cost of the plant, or book value. A business that can return a dollar of net profit every five years for every dollar that the owners invest is truly a cash- generating machine—or, in the case of Tobaccoville, seventy-two cash-generating machines under a single roof.

- realistic replacement value, the return would have been closer to 40 percent.) In 1986 the net profit had risen to $802 million, and by 1999, Tobaccoville was still producing $469 million net profit even as cigarette demand was falling rapidly. (Refer to chart II.02 on the website.) A key number is the profit per 1,000 cigarettes produced—$2.51 in 1982. In 1986 and years following, the figure rose to over $4.00 per 1,000 cigarettes, reflecting the new Tobaccoville productivity and the upgrading of Whitaker Park. The profit per 1,000 cigarettes doubled by 1988.

- In contrast, Phillip Morris showed market share figures each year in detail, and they had much to boast about. Market share was the measure that counted. And from 1962 to 1988, Philip Morris grew from a 10 percent share to a 35 percent share. Most remarkable, the Marlboro brand grew from 2.5 percent to 26 percent. RJR, which began as the market leader with over a 35 percent share, was not able to stay even, declining to a 32 percent share. (Refer to chart II.04 on the website.)

Unfortunately, the string of “experiments” had not been successful, and the market placed a discount price on the entire enterprise. The combination of tobacco’s uncertain future and the seven questionable “experiments,” with all their corporate overhead, made RJR Nabisco ripe for a takeover.

NBC developed or acquired the following: Nabisco Wafers (early 1900s), Barnum’s Animal Crackers (1902), Cameos (1910), Lorna Doones Shortbread Cookies (1912), Oreos (1912), and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924).

This, at last, was a real blockbuster deal; Nabisco doubled the size of RJR Foods. The food and beverage business now were 55 percent of total RJR sales and 35 percent of profits. RJR ranked as the nineteenth biggest company in the world with operations across the globe and sales in more than 150 countries. A list of all its name brands in food, tobacco, and alcohol filled pages, with many brands ranked number one in their market category. RJR Nabisco sold Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico in 1986 for $840 million cash. The business did not fit with the packaged goods strategy. The financials of KFC were not disclosed, but over its five-year history with RJR, it had a return on equity of 3.5 percent, based on the estimate of $962 million of the Heublein purchase price allocated to KFC.

- The Scorecard Wasn’t Impressive The results of twenty-five-years in the food business do not speak well for RJR. Reynolds made nine acquisitions, including KFC, and three divestitures. The acquisitions and later capital commitments were $10.7 billion. Foods returned $11.9 billion in cash flow and residual value, and the ROE was a disappointing 3.2 percent. Results did improve after the purchases of Del Monte, Heublein, and Nabisco. (Refer to chart II.26 on the website.) Prior to 1979, the business never achieved the critical mass needed to succeed at the grocery shelf. The ROE from the beginning in 1963 through 1978 was a disappointing negative 1.1 percent. (Refer to chart II.27 on the website.) In later years, Nabisco’s size and quality product lines added greatly to the potential for RJR Foods, but that potential was never to be fully realized. A change in management and its priorities would put constraints on RJR Foods’s ability to grow. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1868))

- Only a handful of people ever knew why RJR decided to acquire Sea-Land. I have no specific knowledge, but a story from one of the older hands in the mergers and acquisitions group sounds logical: In 1969, RJR management saw conglomerates as a very real danger. It had all the characteristics that these raiders were looking to buy—predictable cash flow, little debt, and a low price-to-earnings ratio for its stock. At the height of the conglomerate craze, the stock showed a disturbing trading pattern. Wednesday afternoon through Friday, the stock rose on trading volume. Each week this trading pattern repeated. Someone was acquiring a significant position in RJR, perhaps to take over the company. This frightened management and they needed to do something. Until now, RJR Foods, Tobacco International, and Archer had used only a tiny part of RJR’s available funds. Now management felt pressure to do something much bigger. The RJR executive committee began to talk about things like “constructive debt,” borrowing more money. Nobody ever explained why more debt would be constructive, except that it might discourage the wolf at the door. They looked for a company that had heavy debt and needed capital. Such a company combined ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1903))

- with tobacco would scare away any would-be acquirer. Management might have asked, “What will we do with such a company after we get it? And, if it makes RJR unattractive to a corporate raider, wouldn’t that also be true for existing shareholders?” However, those were probably secondary concerns. The Man Who Could Solve the Problem At this opportune time, enter Malcolm McLean, a man with a vision: containerized shipping. He had developed the concept and made it commercial, facing obstacles every step of the way, and he was to be admired for his tenacity in the face of unbelievable opposition. Against long odds, he built Sea-Land, the containerized shipping company, starting in 1956. By the late 1960s, containerized shipping was well on its way to transforming the world. The technology was promising, but Sea-Land needed new ships and facilities. And Malcolm, even with his creative ability to borrow money, knew his business could end up with more debt than it could handle. Worse, he might have to sell Sea-Land while in a weak bargaining position. With RJR, he surely knew he had a marriage made in heaven, a partner that would bring a dowry beyond his greatest ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=1912))

- hopes. He already had forty-eight ships, and he proposed that RJR build a fleet of new, superfast vessels. Winston-Salem people knew Malcolm well. He began as a truck driver in Maxton, a small eastern North Carolina town. With his brother, Jim, and sister, Clara, he built the nation’s second-largest freight carrier, McLean Trucking, in Winston-Salem. Malcolm knew everybody in town who was worth knowing; he hobnobbed with most of the city’s power structure. He had many friends, and the city considered Malcolm one of its own and something of a “good old boy.” They were comfortable with him. He was from the same roots as most RJR people. He golfed at Roaring Gap, a Blue Ridge Mountain retreat about an hour’s drive from the city, and the Old Town Club. But while his roots may have been Tar Heel, he was anything but a “good old boy.” He had moved to New York City and lived in the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue by Central Park, and he dined regularly at 21 Club, a few blocks down Fifth Avenue from his home.

- Over the fifteen years following the Sea-Land purchase, RJR pumped about $3.3 billion into ships and facilities. The total purchase price was $1 billion and cumulative net cash flow over sixteen years was a loss, negative $495 million. The company spun off at a market value of $962 million. The annualized rate of return to RJR stockholders was negative 13.9 percent. (Refer to chart II.32 on the website.) But even that poor return understates the losses the RJR stockholders suffered. Summing up all the nonstock pieces of the acquisition price and the cash it generated (including the spin-off), Sea-Land yielded $214 million over fifteen years. For this amount of money, RJR gave up 12.5 million shares of diluting stock that netted $7.9 billion to its owners. RJR stockholders, in the long run, paid out $37 for every dollar they received from the Sea-Land deal, perhaps the all-time record for a bad acquisition. The annualized return, considering the stock dilution, was negative 17.7 percent. (Refer to chart II.33 on the website.)

(This is like flipping a coin and getting sixteen consecutive heads.)

- All the buying and selling raises the question: What did RJR accomplish by diversifying? The most important measure of performance is the discounted cash flow return on equity (ROE)—the percent return to stockholders that the business delivers on the money it invests in this business. Of the nine operating businesses, some did well, while others did poorly. But what was the total score? (Refer to chart II.51 and II.52 on the website.) Tobacco, the driving force from day one, had a ROE of 19.1 percent. RJR Tobacco was 21 percent of the outlay of funds, but was 76 percent of the cash flow, contributing $15.6 billion. Three businesses produced a ROE that exceeded that of RJR Tobacco. Archer and Tobacco International (TI), ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2337))

- both tobacco-related, had superior returns, as did Aminoil. These three winners combined had only 6 percent of the investment outlay and 12.6 percent of the returns. Both TI and Archer had other investment opportunities that could have been exploited—especially TI. This was an opportunity missed, but one that Philip Morris seized by moving early into the international cigarette business. Gerry Gunzenhauser, an RJR Tobacco CFO, told me in 2017, “Salespeople in Winston-Salem managed our early international efforts. It took a long time for management to realize that doing business abroad was very different.” But very worthwhile. Packaging benefitted from the symbiotic relationship with RJR Tobacco, a good thing but difficult to duplicate with outside business. And Archer never grew big enough to have an impact, although it did well. Aminoil USA and Spirits & Wines each provided respectable returns, but they represented only 14.9 percent of the capital invested in acquisitions. The biggest acquisition components were Sea-Land and RJR Foods. RJR Foods was 45 percent of the investment outlay, yet it contributed only 5.8 percent of the return. Sea-Land’s record was disappointing, with its 13.5 percent of the outlay yielding a negative cash return over its life.

- The final tally on the total diversification was a ROE of 6.8 percent, well below stock index returns. These companies used four times the capital that RJR Tobacco used, yet they yielded a return less than a third of Tobacco. RJR Foods had a dismal overall return, largely the result of Del Monte, a commodity business. Foods showed the promise of better days with RJR’s last purchases, Heublein and Nabisco. Unfortunately, these came too late and, with Nabisco, came extra management baggage that destroyed the company. Finally, the shipping business was the poster child for acquisition disasters, giving a negative return over its entire history. (Refer to charts II.53, II.54, and II.55 on the website.) In 1988, RJR had three remaining business units—RJR Tobacco (domestic), Tobacco International, and RJR Foods. The value of the three businesses was estimated to be $17.4 billion.

- RJR considered investing beyond tobacco because management had two fears, both justified. The first was that the government might ban cigarettes. The second, at least in the 1960s, was the fear of being acquired by a conglomerate, probably the stimulus for the Sea-Land deal. But in seeking to protect the company, RJR transformed itself into a conglomerate, and not a very successful one. The acquired companies collectively had a mediocre track record. But the record of those companies is not the final bottom line. Managing a far-flung empire requires assets and people, and these cost money—in RJR’s case, a great deal of money.

- had a fair value of about $76 a share, or $17 billion, yet it was selling at only $50 a share, or about $11 billion. Why did the market discount the value of these businesses $6 billion? Two reasons: First, the corporate overhead burden punished the value of RJR stock by reducing earnings each year, but even more important, investors grew uncertain about new RJR commitments that might increase overhead; analysts were aware of the overhead’s upward trajectory as it was. It is impossible to know all the elements of investors’ thinking when they price a stock, but the overhead burden showing RJR’s propensity to spend was detrimental. A company’s share price reflects profits that investors expect to receive in years to come, but how much that profit will be can be a wild guess. This inability to forecast the future is magnified if a security analyst has no idea what kind of business the company will engage in next. This uncertainty penalized the stock value about $3 billion. The second factor that penalized RJR was the uncertainty of… ([Location 2391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2391))

RJR’s “imaginative experiments” disappointed investors. The total units of RJR had a 16.6 percent ROE as operating businesses, but with a wide variance between RJR Tobacco (19.1 percent) and everything else (6.7 percent). However, with the corporate overhead and Tobacco Liability Penalty, the disparity widens even more—a total ROE of 14.9 percent, with Tobacco at 18.8 percent and the acquisitions at negative 3.1 percent. (Refer to chart II.57 on the website.) It is arguable that the total acquisition effort conducted for twenty-eight years gave a negative return, considering the pessimistic valuation investors placed on RJR. Even if this analysis attributes too much of the poor stock price to the acquisition program, the record is still not admirable.

- that are going to happen once the acquirer takes charge. (What acquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?) A few years later, bankers, straight-faced and just as earnestly, urge spinning off the earlier acquisition to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its purported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will flourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy of the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.) If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be urged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by the banking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions, rather than transactions leading to fees.)

- Sea-Land shareholders got over half of all the RJR shares issued for acquisitions. Heublein sellers got the highest ROE, 27.8 percent, since they held their stock only six years before it soared with the buyout. In total, the new stockholders had a lofty 21.3 percent return on their stock. The companies RJR acquired with stock were quite a contrast to this with a return of negative 3.8 percent, mostly due to the large loss on the Sea-Land swap. We do not know the return generated by the RJR Foods companies bought with stock, but we can estimate that overall, they did no better than the 6 percent ROE of the total RJR Foods. With Sea-Land, we know that the ROE was negative 13.7 percent per year. However, these “for stock” acquisition stories did not end with the sale of the business because even after the operating business was no longer a part of RJR, the original stockholders were penalized by the dilution from stock paid out for the acquisitions. That stock remained outstanding and took value away from the other shareholders. What those sellers to RJR received and what RJR got contrast dramatically, especially so for Sea-Land shareholders. The stock they received gave them a 16.8 percent return on their investment. The return on the Sea-Land acquisition was an annualized negative 13.7 percent ROE.

An LBO is, at its core, just a way to finance a business. The goal is to buy a company and then make it more profitable by selling off undesirable pieces, cutting costs in operations, or both. The owner can use those profits to pay back the money borrowed to buy the business, and either run the business profitably or, more likely, sell it. We will never know when or why Ross decided on an LBO; the evidence is conflicting. ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2830))

- Ross initially didn’t like the LBO idea because bank debt would force him to rein in his spending. He needed investment bankers to raise billions of dollars, but he also knew that the bankers would control him. They would insist that he forego his high lifestyle, and he didn’t welcome such oversight. But Henry Kravis had planted the idea with Ross about how much money an LBO could make the buyers. Perhaps Ross imagined he could have it both ways. If Wall Street would not value RJR for what it was worth, then Ross would force it to full value, even if that meant carving up the company. RJR people were aware that KKR was the potential bidder most likely to buy the company, given KKR’s giant size and reputation. Ross talked to Salomon Brothers about doing a deal, but even they, a prime investment bank, were not big enough to readily assure the $17 billion that would be needed to buy RJR. KKR had never done a deal that big, but they were formidable, and if anyone could pull it off, it was probably them. Finally, Ross chose Shearson Lehman Hutton as his investment banker. But Harry Durity said, “The problem was that Ross went to the Superbowl with a ‘B’ team when he was playing against an experienced Superbowl champion in KKR.”35 Ross began working with Shearson Lehman Hutton to ([Location 2835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2835))

- bring a completed LBO proposal to his board of directors. He hoped a quick approval would prevent other bidders looking to buy RJR at higher prices. Deciding to Do an LBO The book Barbarians at the Gate opens with Ross discussing this strategy with outside counsel, Steve Goldstone of Davis Polk & Wardwell. Goldstone warned Johnson that he had no idea the forces he was about to unleash. Goldstone was savvier about the ways of Wall Street, and he could foresee the damage that this proposal would do to so many people. But Ross forged ahead. Barbarians at the Gate details the day-by-day drama as this biggest leveraged buyout in history progressed. I will confine my description to only those points pertinent to the finances and their future impact on businesses and individuals.

- This seminal moment for R. J. Reynolds had been a long time coming, but nearly thirty years of misdirection for RJR had finally brought it to this. On October 19, 1988, one year to the day after the great stock market crash, Ross approached the board with an offer. He and a group of seven RJR executives would pay $75 a share, about $17 billion. The stock was trading at $56. His terms were control of the board and 20 percent of the stock for himself and his group—valued at about $3.5 billion—without putting up any money. He gave no details of his personal share, but a fair guess would be that Ross expected 5 percent, worth more than $880 million, producing a growing cash flow for him each year starting at $60 million. Even allowing for error in valuation, the amount was staggering. Ross had done his homework. (Refer to chart III.03 on the website.) Ross’s perceived greed stunned everyone. The board members were shocked. He surely assumed that because the board had anointed him and he had gone above and beyond the call of duty to ingratiate himself to them, ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2863))

- they would bless his plan and hand him the company. But just as Steve Goldstone had warned, this audacious proposal put the board in an awkward position, and personal relationships went out the window. Directors of acquisition targets face a challenge: An offer at a new high price may not be good enough. The directors must test whether better offers are on the sidelines, and even what the company might be worth eventually if it is not sold. The RJR board issued a press release, putting the company into play while they considered their options. The board had to rely on management for most of its information about the company. But Ross Johnson was proposing to buy the company himself. Even if Ross had been forthright with them, they dared not trust him (or anyone). Too much was at stake. While they may not have voiced their concerns, the directors had to wonder, If Ross says $75 a share is the value, could he have done more to get the stock up to its “fair value?” ([Location 2870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2870))

- The directors were suspicious, and they were feeling the heat as Winston-Salem people began to rake them over the coals. The city was none too fond of Ross Johnson nor of the board that had put him in charge, and they saw this as the final indignant act, the straw that broke the Camel’s back. “This group of insiders was entrusted with the management of the RJR tobacco company. In return we are lied to, cheated and used by a small group for their own gain. I fail to see the difference between what Johnson is doing and armed robbery, except that you will let Johnson get away with it.” —Veteran RJR Tobacco worker36 ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2882))

- No Choice Except an Auction The directors decided that their only way forward was an auction. They created a special committee to entertain bids.

- immediate leap to a 20 percent premium. On November 3, Ross’s team raised their bid to $92. As these bids arrived, the board considered its liability. Richard Budd, a local Winston-Salem businessman, attended a dinner in New York with one of the RJR directors. Budd asked, “How much directors’ insurance does RJR provide you?” The answer was $100 million each. Richard pointed out what was probably already on the director’s mind: “That’s not enough.”37 RJR had eighteen directors, so the total insurance coverage was $1.8 billion. The margin for error in the RJR deal had just leaped by $3.4 billion with the new bid. Now, with many billions of dollars at stake, a questionable decision would invite massive lawsuits. But how should the directors figure out what the company was really worth? Standard methods of security analysis put the value at about $75 a share. But the issues went beyond price. If the buyer laid huge debts on the balance sheet, the bond ratings would drop. That would punish RJR’s existing bondholders.

- Johnson group raised its offer to $100 a share, KKR raised its bid to $94, and a new bidder, First Boston Group, made a complex offer valued at between $105 and $118. The First Boston bid looked best, but it had structural shortcomings. Also, First Boston had not yet received all the confidential company information that Johnson and KKR had, so First Boston’s assumptions might not have been realistic. On November 29, Johnson upped his bid to $101. KKR bid $106. First Boston offer was valued at $103 to $115.On November 30, the special committee had two final bids. The Johnson group claimed its bid was worth $112 a share, but the committee thought it was worth $108. KKR said its bid was worth $109, but the committee thought it also was worth $108. (Neither offer was all cash, and there was difference of opinion on the noncash portion.) The board declared the two bids equal. The directors accepted KKR’s bid. Their official reasons: KKR offered more equity and planned to keep the tobacco business and much of the food business, whereas the Johnson group would sell the food business. KKR also promised benefits to terminated employees and the Johnson group would not. The board also had an unofficial reason for their choice: they resented Ross’s first low offer and the big payoff for him and his team. The public interpreted the choice as a final snub of Ross Johnson, the man who had created such controversy for two years. The bidding, with the constant pressure of time deadlines, brought confusion and mixed signals as all the teams attempted to get the deal done. One such confusion, early in the bidding process, was a hastily called meeting of thirteen strategic business unit heads of Tobacco International around the world. It was to be a special meeting at the Essex House suite in New York to announce that the Ross Johnson team had won the deal. Unfortunately, that was premature, and the meeting was very short. They considered a possible follow-up meeting, but of course it never… ([Location 2902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2902))

- this served to make cookies and crackers or cigarettes better or cheaper for the customers. Headlines during the six-week battle for RJR would lead readers to think that it was all about money. But the participants played this game for many reasons; money was only a way to keep score. That is the strange world of Wall Street and high finance. One investment bank considered negating the whole deal over something as seemingly trivial as a newspaper ad. When a deal was completed on Wall Street, the participants would place an announcement (called a “tombstone ad” because of its simple design) in the Wall Street Journal and other financial journals listing all the banks that financed the transaction, sometimes ten or more names. But the bankers considered top billing to be the upper-left corner. Reportedly, Salomon Brothers learned that they might occupy the top right while their hated competitor Drexel Burnham Lambert would be on the left.

- would be inconsequential to most of us, but it was critical to the bankers. Peter Cohen at Shearson Lehman Hutton was intent on landing the deal and improving Shearson’s prestige. He was so determined that he extended concessions to Ross Johnson that made no economic sense, agreeing to give the Johnson group 20 percent of the company for nothing. If Shearson and Johnson bought RJR for $75 a share, this meant that the buyers of the other 80 percent would have to pay $93.75 for their shares. And as their offer rose to $112 a share, the 80 percent owners would have paid $140 a share, an astronomical and entirely unjustifiable price under any circumstances. (We do not know if Shearson renegotiated its terms with Johnson as the price rose.) John Greeniaus, the operating head of Nabisco, knew many areas that could be made more profitable and he resented what Ross Johnson had already done to Nabisco. He began to undermine Johnson’s group by giving KKR critical information that let them know that Nabisco had more value than they realized. Money was not Greeniaus’s motivation. He took pride in having a well-run company and wanted an opportunity to continue to make it so.

- him than cash in his pocket. He was not even interested in “winning” hundreds of millions of dollars if that required dialing back his fun. He famously declared, “I’m telling you, we’re not going to start running a pushcart operation here. I don’t want a bunch of your guys coming around saying we should have five jets instead of six . . . I don’t want my lifestyle to change.”38 The bidders were motivated not necessarily by money but by prestige and ego. Professor Bulent Gultekin, in his course at Wharton on this case, wisely points out, “Almost everyone involved was already rich, by conventional standards. Although huge amounts of money changed hands in the deal, there may not have been a single person actively involved whose standard of living changed as a result of winning, or losing . . .”39 Normal, work-a-day people find it hard to grasp that people who already enjoy riches most of us can only imagine would engage in such a titanic struggle when the outcome means nothing to their lives, or that they would commit such enormous sums of money to an enterprise with no productive end in view yet would disrupt the lives of countless employees for little or no economic reason. Whatever their motives, the LBO caused aftershocks that continued for years. To this day, Ross Johnson is vilified in Winston-Salem. As it turned out, RJR Nabisco was the height of the LBO craze. What the Winning Bidder Bought To win the bidding war, KKR paid $25 billion, $8 billion more than Ross Johnson’s initial offer. But the rocky buyout road highlighted how difficult it is to value a company. We are not privy to the valuations of the Johnson group or KKR, but some estimates of RJR’s value are instructive, so we’ll explore these before we move on to the aftermath—the dark ages—that followed the deal. At $75 a share, the Johnson team would need $16.8 billion to buy all the stock. But the buyer had to consider other costs as well. Preferred stock outstanding was worth $135 million. RJR already had debt on its books of $4.6 billion. The two liabilities did not have to be paid immediately, but they were still a cost to the buyer. In total, the company would cost $21.6 billion. Financing fees to the bankers who would raise all this cash would add an estimated $150 million. What would the buyer get? The prize that the Johnson team wanted was the domestic tobacco company; it generated $1.2 billion of cash each year. Their plan was to sell all the other pieces. The value of those pieces was $18.6 billion, based on their past performance. If ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2939))

- the Johnson team could sell these parts quickly enough, they would have not only R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, but also nearly $2.5 billion in cash left over. The unknown was whether they could sell all these parts, and how quickly. If the Johnson team could not turn these potential sales to cash soon, the carrying cost would require them to borrow much more money. But at $75 a share, they had a good margin for error. Unfortunately for Ross Johnson, the board did not accept his first offer, and events quickly spun out of his control, just as Goldstone had warned. At a price of $92 a share, the assets in the deal remained the same, but the extra $17 a share meant that the buyer needed an additional $3.8 billion to buy the outstanding stock. And this in turn meant more borrowed money and more banker fees to raise that money. The margin for error had now shrunk to a less comfortable level. The auction had many moving parts. The buyer would not know what some of the assets were worth until they tried to sell them, and the bidders seemed to ignore this… ([Location 2960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=2960))

- A leveraged buyout is simply buying a business and paying for it with borrowed money that will be repaid by the business’s future profits. This is like buying a rental property with borrowed money, except that there are more moving pieces that require a great deal of work to make it a success.

- KKR put only $16.3 million of its own money into the purchase, a mere 0.06 percent of the entire deal. KKR was the general partner of a $1.5 billion limited partnership yet had complete control of RJR. The rest of $1.5 billion (5.1 percent of the deal) came from the limited partners—pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutions. The remaining 95 percent of the money was debt and preferred securities. RJR already had about $4.5 billion in debt. Adding the existing debt, preferred stock, banking fees, and other obligations, RJR was a $30 billion investment. KKR, in its initial round of financing, borrowed $19 billion, soon followed by $6.2 billion of preferred stock and convertible stock. (See chart below.)

It was an odd choice, yet his appointment had a sad logic, and with hindsight, Goldstone was an excellent choice for the job. Over the next several years, fending off lawsuits was management’s top priority. At the end of 1998, the tobacco industry entered the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). A watershed event, massive settlements between the four major tobacco companies and all the states’ attorneys general required these tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars over a multi-year period to the states. Its main advantage to the industry was that it removed some of the cloud surrounding tobacco health litigation. Goldstone played a leading role in the 1998 settlement of this landmark class-action lawsuit. By most accounts, Goldstone showed great industry leadership in the MSA. The people who worked with him said he was a good businessman, a clear and rational thinker, a sound decision-maker, and a good negotiator.

- cut cigarette prices by 20 percent. They knew that RJR would have to follow and that it was far less able to take the profit hit. RJR cut list prices on its premium brands, making it difficult to sell its mid-price brands, but increased prices for lowest-tier brands. For the year, net dollar sales declined from the impact of price reductions for premium brands. For the second half of 1993, Tobacco’s margins were squeezed between “new” product prices and “old” costs. Tobacco’s workforce was reduced in 1993 by 11 percent. The company streamlined the sales force, revamping reporting, systems, offices, and administrative functions. Such draconian measures were mandatory. Again, the debt placed the company between the proverbial rock of battling Philip Morris and the hard place of needing cash to retire debt. Tobacco had to give up nine cents of every sales dollar to meet the interest charges on its LBO debt, against only three cents that Philip Morris had to allot to debt service. For Tobacco, 1994 was a comeback year spurred by renewed stability in the domestic market after the damaging impact of the 1993 price war. Tobacco reengineered its business, cut costs by more than $650 million, and restored margins to within two points of pre–price ([Location 3374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=3374))

This was an impressive profit performance, given that net sales were 8 percent less than the prior year and shipment volume declined 7 percent. To counter Marlboro Friday, Tobacco invested substantial resources—particularly during the second half of 1994 to improve share performance of full-price brands and to stabilize share in the savings segment. Although total retail share declined about two points from 1993, the core brands’ share improved. For the rest of the decade, Tobacco operations followed a consistent pattern of increasing prices and decreasing unit sales, but profits declined about 10 percent a year.

It did nothing to improve the industry’s image. On the legal front, RJR and the industry faced challenges old and new. The company and the industry continue to defend successfully against lawsuits brought by individual smokers and cases brought by nonsmokers concerning secondhand smoke. But two new legal challenges emerged in 1994: additional class-action suits and, most threatening, three state governments sued the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid and other costs paid by those states to treat diseases allegedly related to cigarette smoking. This threat would completely change the industry in the next five years. In the shorter term, RJR Tobacco faced a problem unique to itself. Its image suffered after the American Medical Association concluded that children were attracted to the company’s advertisements featuring cartoon character Joe Camel.

- Shortly thereafter, the tobacco industry received a devastating legal blow. RJR, Philip Morris, Lorillard, and British American Tobacco (BAT) were sued by dozens of state attorneys general for the costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses. Although they agreed to a settlement in 1997, the deal disintegrated during the congressional approval process. In the meantime, the tobacco companies raised cigarette prices significantly, preparing for a potential large settlement payout. Finally, late in 1998, the cigarette makers agreed to pay states $206 billion. Although the final amount was less than agreed to before, the companies did not win protection from private class-action suits, a condition for which they had lobbied strongly. In March 1999, the Federal Trade Commission dropped its Joe Camel suit against R. J. Reynolds, saying the 1998 tobacco settlement had accomplished the goals of their litigation.

- Settlement Agreement, Goldstone’s priority became selling the international tobacco business: “We wanted to find a value for our shareholders that was high enough to fix the balance sheet of our domestic tobacco business.”57 On May 12, 1999, in the first of four bold moves, the parent sold Tobacco International to Japan Tobacco for $8 billion. The proceeds were used to pay down debt remaining from the original LBO. Second, on May 18, 1999, the parent announced that it would spin off RJR Tobacco to shareholders, and in June, it gave a third of a share of RJR Tobacco to the RN shareholders for each share of their stock. RJR Tobacco was again a separate company and responsible for any smoking-related claims in the United States. At this point, three companies—the parent RJR Nabisco (RN), RJR Tobacco domestic (RJR), and Nabisco foods (NB)—all traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Most of the ninety or so employees at the parent’s headquarters in New York were laid off. The sale and spin-off removed parent RJR Nabisco from the tobacco business. But it continued to own 80.5 percent of Nabisco, and unfortunately, the parent was still potentially liable for tobacco-related legal claims if the RJR Tobacco company were to go bankrupt. Then in a third move, in June 2000, the parent sold its ([Location 3668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=3668))

The problem for Philip Morris was that the parent carried with it the taint of potential tobacco lawsuits; Nabisco did not. “I’ve got enough of my own legal troubles without buying any more,” said Geoffrey Bible, the Philip Morris CEO.58 Fourth and finally, on December 11, 2000, RJR Tobacco acquired its former parent, RJR Nabisco, now a non-operating public shell company with no material assets or liabilities other than $11.8 billion in cash. RJR paid $30 for each outstanding share, $10.3 billion. Net cash proceeds to RJR Tobacco shareholders was $1.5 billion, after transaction costs and payments to parent stockholders for their shares. The parent shareholders accepted this $1.5 billion discount on the shares because of the potential tobacco lawsuit liability. RJR Tobacco was not concerned about more lawsuits; it was already totally exposed to the liability anyway. ([Location 3678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=3678))

- In the first half of 2003, RJR’s sales dropped 18 percent from a year earlier to $2.6 billion, while operating income fell 59 percent to $275 million. In a critical move, in October 2003, RJR merged with Brown & Williamson Tobacco, a division of British American Tobacco (BAT). Each RJR share was exchanged for one share of the new company, Reynolds American (RAI). British American got 42 percent of the new company. BAT also got the right to buy the balance of the new RAI that it did not own (58 percent) at some future date. (Refer to chart V.07 on the website.) Reynolds American began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange as RAI in August 2004. The two operations were fully integrated by 2006. (Refer to the website post WP V.01—Brown & Williamson). RAI acquired Conwood, the second-largest U.S. smokeless tobacco company, in May 2006 for $3.5 billion in cash. (Refer to chart V.08 on the website.) Conwood manufactured moist and dry snuff, loose leaf, plug, and twist chewing tobaccos. At the time of the acquisition, 70 percent of Conwood’s sales came from the growing moist-snuff segment with the fast-growing Grizzly brand. Grizzly’s continued growth after 2006 made it the best-selling brand in the moist-snuff category. Conwood’s name was later changed to American Snuff Company. Seeking an entry into the alternative nicotine product market, RAI acquired Niconovum AB, a Swedish-based nicotine replacement therapy company for $44 million in cash, in December 2009. (Refer to chart V.09 on the website.) In July 2014, Reynolds American, Inc. announced it would buy Lorillard Tobacco for roughly $27.4 billion of cash, stock, and assumed debt. The deal also included the sale of Kool, Winston, and Salem brands to Imperial Tobacco for $7.1 billion.The merger became official on June 12, 2015. Newport, Lorillard’s flagship premium cigarette brand, was the top-selling menthol and second-largest selling cigarette in the United States. Lorillard also had four additional cigarette brand families—Kent, True, Maverick, and Old Gold—and a leading global electronic cigarette company. (Refer to chart V.10 on the website and the website post WP V.02—Lorillard.) Two key sales helped RAI finance the Lorillard purchase: a $4.7 billion investment from British American Tobacco so that BAT kept a 42 percent ownership stake in Reynolds American and $4.4 billion in after-tax proceeds from Imperial. Reynolds assumed $3.5 billion in Lorillard debt. ([Location 3739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=3739))

- Following the transactions, RAI had more than $11 billion in annual revenues and approximately $5 billion in annual operating income, and it had key brands across major industry categories: Newport, Camel, Pall Mall, and Natural American Spirit in combustible cigarettes; Grizzly in smokeless tobacco; and VUSE in the vapor market. Only two major domestic cigarette companies remained, Reynolds American and Philip Morris, now renamed Altria. RAI’s new market share was 32.4 percent, compared to 24.6 percent pre-deal. RJR Tobacco Disappears In 2017, Reynolds American agreed to sell to British American Tobacco for $49.4 billion. That July, BAT exercised its purchase rights and bought the balance of RAI, creating a wholly owned subsidiary. The RAI shareholders received a combination of cash and BAT stock. (Refer to chart V.11 on the website.) After 142 years, the Reynolds name and the company passed into history. The eighteen years following Tobacco’s independence in 1999 continued to be a time of extreme competition between Philip Morris and the rest of the industry. The other major tobacco companies came to understand that their only chance of survival was through consolidation. If they remained independent, it would be much easier ([Location 3758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=3758))

- This was in a period of headwinds for the tobacco industry. Government taxes and fees on cigarettes (excluding income tax) started at $3.4 billion and ended at $7.3 billion. These various stakeholders in the tobacco industry were receiving a third of the gross profit from cigarettes. The costs of these payments started at 54 cents per pack of cigarettes in 1999 but steadily increased and reached $3.16 a pack in 2017, an escalation of 10.3 percent a year. All this occurred at a time when total cigarettes smoked dropped from 419 billion to 239 billion, negative 3.3 percent a year. The economic term “inelasticity of demand” certainly applied to cigarettes. Throughout the period, enough “hard-core” smokers were willing to pay ever rising prices.

- Philip Morris combined Nabisco with Kraft to form the second biggest food company in the world behind Nestlé. The Nabisco price was a rich twenty-five times earnings, but Philip Morris projected that the merger would bring cost savings of $600 million in 2003, reducing the purchase multiple to eighteen times earnings. The combined company had a broad array of products. To the union, Kraft brought renowned brands such as Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Post cereals, Maxwell House Coffee, Kool-Aid, and Jell-O. Nabisco had a complete line of snacks and handheld foods that Kraft coveted to round out its product line for the supermarket shelves. Kraft’s CEO said, “There is ‘no better fit.’ It gets us into snack foods, which are growing at twice the rate of the total food market.”63 Kraft employed 65,000 people worldwide, and Nabisco had 53,000.

Food makers had to become more efficient to maintain profit margins. Kraft’s plan was to acquire and then trim overhead. In June 2001, Philip Morris sold 16 percent of the new Kraft in an initial public offering (IPO) to retire debt. The IPO of 280 million shares at $31 a share raised $8.7 billion, giving Kraft a market value of $54 billion. After the merger, Nabisco’s performance could no longer be tracked accurately. In 2010, Kraft Foods bought British candy maker Cadbury. In 2012, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business to a new company called Kraft Foods Group.

Here were the two men who were “present at the creation.” Goldstone talked about the problems with the company, and they thought back to that October day in 1988. Johnson made an ironical comment, “Once you get north of (bid above) $92 a share, you’re never going to be able to run this company (successfully).”64 Ross had the number pegged about right. The question is, was it hindsight or did he really have a feel for this during the bidding? Given the comments from those who knew Ross well, he was a genius with the numbers, and we should assume that he did recognize the $92 ceiling back in 1988.

- FTR’s cash flow was dramatic because of its unique tax position. U.S. cigarette companies acted as excise tax collectors. They had a cash flow benefit unique to the industry, since cigarette taxes were much higher relative to prices than on almost all other products. The government did not require cigarette manufacturers to turn over these taxes from wholesalers for weeks or sometimes months. Thus, the manufacturers had a cash reserve to help meet their daily costs of doing business and to reduce the amount they would have otherwise needed to borrow. This benefit was even greater in Europe because cigarette tax rates were so much higher than in the United States.

- On Friday, April 2, 1993, the price of Philip Morris stock dropped an astounding 26 percent. This came to be known as Marlboro Friday. It shook investor confidence not just in Marlboro but in the idea of brands themselves. With its radical makeover, by 1993, Marlboro was the world’s best-selling cigarette. But Philip Morris announced it would cut the price of a pack by a huge 40 cents, shocking investors. Why would the world’s best-selling cigarette do that? The reason: competition. Discount brands and smokers who consumed fewer cigarettes had heated up cigarette competition, and Philip Morris had made a preemptive strike. It was feeling pressure from RJR but knew that it had the upper hand in a price and marketing war. RJR was still weak from its LBO four years earlier. It needed every dollar it could raise to retire debt and had no extra advertising money to counter Philip Morris.

- But the message to the stock market was doubly bad when investors learned that Marlboro would invest even more in advertising. The market was irrational as it often is on surprise news, asking, “What if branding, like the name Marlboro, is worthless?” Of course, this was not the case. Philip Morris, renamed Altria a few years later, continued to be one of the best stock investments of all time. The black Friday in 1993 was a great buying opportunity. Philip Morris was selling one and a half times the number of cigarettes RJR was selling by the 1990s—by 1995, it was selling twice as many—and RJR, still owned by KKR, was preoccupied with reducing their immense debt before it crushed them. And, finally, in 2000, after the implosion of RJR, Philip Morris bought much of the old Nabisco. However, the Philip Morris management must have seen the “culture clash” between tobacco and food, and they spun off their food business into a separate company. In 2003, Philip Morris changed its name to Altria, and it spun off its giant overseas tobacco division, PMI, in 2008. Investors saw this as a bullish development for both companies. Over time, both Altria and PMI began to trail key domestic and overseas rivals in profit growth. From 1991 ([Location 4250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=4250))

Marlboro units declined only slightly and captured a 44 percent share, up from 25 percent, but Philip Morris competitors merged and maintained or increased profitability through economies of scale. (Refer to chart VII.01 on the website.) PMI operated in more than 100 countries with a 25 percent market share outside the United States, excluding China, but RJR’s international business, now out of its dark age and with a new owner, Japan Tobacco, was beginning to mount a challenge.

Governments have levied excise tax on cigarettes for decades. They also collect income tax on the profits of the tobacco companies, their suppliers, cigarette wholesalers, and retailers. But, in addition, in 1998, the cigarette companies cut what some called a “deal with the devil” to make multibillion-dollar payments to various claimants. The larger of these payments was not for a finite time but rather to perpetuity. Contradiction and Hypocrisy The laws and settlements that extract taxes and fees from the gold leaf underscore the contradiction.

Tobacco found itself with few friends; its historical supporters deserted it, their loyalty fading when they saw it was far better to get a share of the Midas-like riches from the cigarette manufacturers. With an ever-increasing appetite for tobacco cash, over a period of thirty years these groups managed to become full partners in the tobacco business, getting at least 56 percent of the total dollars that U.S. smokers spend, while at the same time denouncing tobacco as evil.

- The Deal from Hell One RJR official describes this settlement from RJR’s perspective as “the deal from hell.” He thought the tobacco companies gave away far too much. The deal included not only direct monetary payments but also significant changes in the way the tobacco companies conducted business. They agreed to close the Tobacco Institute and other lobbying efforts and severely limit media advertising. Such “standstill” measures favored Philip Morris over the other cigarette companies. Philip Morris had about 50 percent of the domestic market, and the restrictions imposed by the MSA made it hard to alter market share going forward—a good deal for Philip Morris and a bad deal for everyone else. Pro-business politicians considered the settlement one-sided and criticized the tobacco companies for not fighting harder. They saw the huge settlement to attorneys as funding their “enemies.” The lawyers now had a war chest to go after other product liability targets. Steven Goldstone, RJR’s CEO, resisted, but he could do no more than fight a holding action on the MSA. One RJR officer believed that, when setting up the MSA, the attorneys left a hole you could drive a truck through. They allowed a competitive advantage to startup cigarette companies that would not be bound to make payments. At the time the MSA became effective, the OPMs controlled about 97 percent of the domestic cigarette ([Location 4355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=4355))

At least forty-one such companies sprang up around the country, and it took eight years to close the loophole and bring them to equal footing with the majors. Many of these startups ran afoul of myriad regulations as well as potential MSA payments. Some went broke, and others had an even more onerous outcome involving fraud and tax evasion. One such company started in 1994 and grew to sales of more than $50 million and nearly 140 employees. Its rise and fall was tragic, and the founder went to jail for violating tax laws. The MSA for all states was $40 billion for the first four settling states and $206 billion for the remaining forty-six states. The four manufacturers would pay the $246 billion during the first twenty-five years in annual installments. The total is likely to be somewhat less than the stated $246 billion until 2024 due to reduced tobacco sales volume, but the payments will continue for decades or until cigarettes are outlawed in the United States.

- Smoking and health is a one-dimensional issue: cigarettes are a deadly threat. But the argument gets muddied when enormous amounts of tobacco money influence decisions on the issue. The solution to this problem is still being worked out all over the world. On the one hand, if we know tobacco is harmful, do we not have a moral obligation to close the industry? Yet many other products, perhaps not quite as harmful, still cause damage to health. Where do we, as a society, draw the line in dictating people’s choices to “protect” them? Too much fat in fast-food burgers? Too much sugar in soft drinks? Should they be heavily regulated and forced to limit advertising? America performed such a social experiment in the 1920s with alcohol prohibition, and that did not end well. Philip Morris’s CEO Joseph Cullen III famously said, “I have no problem selling a legal product to adults if they have been warned of its risks. And they have certainly been warned!” Perhaps he has a point. Looking back at the more-than-a-hundred-year history of cigarettes, we can see the ambivalence toward its use. Most of the conflicting views arose from the money involved and those who wanted to get their hands on that money. From the 1930s through the 1950s, cigarette companies engaged in advertising that was at the very least misleading and that in the latter years showed an “in-your-face” disregard for the overwhelming evidence linking cigarettes to lung cancer. However, in those same earlier decades, the advertising of other products made claims that were just as ambiguous and ridiculous. Soap that was “99.44 percent pure”—purer than what? A “tiger in your tank”—really? Cigarette advertisements in those early years were justified to a degree because manufacturers did not really know how dangerous cigarettes were, a position that could be called into question by 1959 and 1960. But to give some context, even then many doctors still supported the view that there was no link between cigarettes and lung cancer. They refused to acknowledge the new damaging health data, probably because they themselves were heavy smokers, and, human nature being what it is, they did not want to give up a product they loved or admit that there could be a connection between smoking and bad health. For them, no less than those millions without medical knowledge, ignorance ([Location 4497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08G2K6S6T&location=4497))

- was bliss. With this kind of opposition or indifference, meeting the health issue in a meaningful way was a slow process that took over twenty-five years. Where does this leave the Tar Heel State today? Aside from a small cigarette manufacturing presence and a few large tobacco growers in the coastal plain, its tobacco culture has passed into history and probably will soon be just a memory kept by a few people who will also soon pass into history. Some say, “Not a minute too soon.” And from an ethical perspective, they are surely right. But for those of us of a certain age, that does not diminish our memories of the decades when we did not see the gold leaf as a clear and present danger to health, when nearly half the people in America smoked, and when it afforded a living for people like my family and me in a time and place where there were few alternatives. As we look back at tobacco, we need to judge those involved not by today’s standards and with today’s medical knowledge, but in the context of their times.
