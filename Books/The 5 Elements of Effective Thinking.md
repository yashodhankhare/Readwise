- Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success. Make mistakes: Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers—they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination. Raise questions: Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What’s the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air—the right questions will bring them out and… ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=189))

- milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs. These four building blocks are basic elements for effective thinking, and we devised an easy way for you to remember them. You only need to recall the classical elements that were once believed to be the essential parts of all nature and matter. Those elements, which predated Socrates and influenced Renaissance culture and thought, are Earth, Fire, Air, and Water. So to help trigger your memory and enable you to apply these techniques, we associate each classical element with one of our strategies for effective thinking, learning, and creating: Earth ↔ Understand deeply Fire ↔ Make mistakes Air ↔ Raise questions Water ↔ Follow the flow of ideas By mastering these strategies, you can and will change. The classical elements of nature included a fifth special element—the quintessential element—that was the changeless matter from which all the heavens were made. Ironically, here in our context of thinking and learning, the quintessential element is change. The Quintessential Element ↔ Change Change: The unchanging element is change—by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning. In any movie, play, or literary work, media scholars… ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=200))

- Your challenge is to make these elements a part of your daily routine. We urge you to read this tiny book slowly and then reread it. In fact, we thought of literally repeating the entire text three times (making the book three times as long); however, our publisher refused to embrace our innovative idea. Instead we suggest three readings, as follows: First read: Take it all in and don’t mind the details—Throughout the text, we provide exercises where we invite you to pause, look back, contemplate, and experiment. However, during your first read-through, don’t necessarily pause to attempt these exercises. Instead, get a global sense of the entire story we are telling. Second read: Give it a test drive—Return to the beginning and slowly reread the book, this time stopping to think about and to apply the suggestions and exercises to your life. Third read: Make it your own—You have now tried the exercises and reflected on the elements twice. In this third reading, work toward letting those methods become second nature. We encourage you to revisit chapters again and again—different elements will resonate with you at different times. The more you absorb and practice these elements of thinking, the more you will get out of them. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=226))

- In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases. Once is never enough. As you revisit fundamentals, you will find new insights. It may appear that returning to basics is a step backward and requires additional time and effort; however, by building on firm foundations you will soon see your true abilities soar higher and faster.

- The simple and familiar hold the secrets of the complex and unknown. The depth with which you master the basics influences how well you understand everything you learn after that. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=325))

- To learn any subject well and to create ideas beyond those that have existed before, return to the basics repeatedly. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=331))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Whenever you “see” an issue or “understand” a concept, be conscious of the lens through which you’re viewing the subject. You should assume you’re introducing bias. The challenge remains to identify and let go of that bias or the assumptions you bring, and actively work to see and understand the subject anew.

- To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see—no matter how mundane or obvious—rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=482))

- Once you’re open to the positive potential of failure, failing productively involves two basic steps: creating the mistake and then exploiting the mistake. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=663))

- You may not know how to do it right, but you can certainly do it wrong. A good way to generate useful mistakes is simply to tackle the issue at hand by quickly constructing the best solution you can with little or no effort. Like magic, suddenly many useful errors will appear. Here’s a practical means by which to create ideas. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=747))

- Finding the right question to the wrong answer Sometimes when your attempt fails to resolve one issue, you might discover that you have actually found an imaginative answer to a totally different question. That is, your bad solution to one problem might lead to a different project altogether—a project suggested by the accidental virtues of your mostly bad attempt. Junk bonds. At 3M Research Laboratories, if someone says “scotch,” coworkers think “transparent tape” rather than “adult beverage”—and for good reason: 3M is one of the leading manufacturers of all that is sticky. In 1970, 3M scientist Spencer Silver was working hard to create an even stronger adhesive. His creation was a resounding failure. In fact, the bond was actually weaker than other 3M products of the day—it was so weak it could be stuck to objects and then easily lifted off them without a trace. Oh, well. Silver did not come unglued over his failed attempt, and 3M did not fire him. Wise move, since four years later, when 3M scientist Arthur Fry was trying to devise a way of placing bookmarks in his hymnal so they would neither fall out nor damage the pages, he recalled his colleague’s weak mixture. Fry coated part of his bookmarks with Silver’s superweak adhesive and thus accidentally gave birth to one of 3M’s most lucrative products: the Post-it note. It all arose out of a failed attempt. Seeing a mistake as possibly a correct answer to a different question puts our thinking on its head. We look at a mistake not as a wrong answer, but instead as an opportunity to ask, “What is the question to which this is a correct answer?” Two reactions to mistakes. So when you see or make a mistake, you have at least two actions to take: (1) let the mistake lead you to a better attempt, and/or (2) ask whether the mistake is a correct answer to a different question.

- Final thoughts: A modified mind-set Mistakes and failure are not signs of weakness; instead they are opportunities for future success. Failure is a sign of a creative mind, of original thought and strength. In fact, at Williams College one of the authors created a course entitled Exploring Creativity, in which students found themselves facing unfamiliar and uncomfortable intellectual challenges. To succeed in that course, students were required to push themselves hard to take risks and create wildly without fear of failure. A person who is willing to fail is someone who is willing to step outside the box. Being willing to fail is a liberating attribute of transformative thinking. Failing is progress; it’s not losing ground. Often a mistake or the revelation of error is the most important step toward success. A colossal error may be just millimeters away from a great insight. When you’re stuck, and you don’t know what to do, don’t do nothing—instead, fail. Making a specific mistake puts you in a different and better position than you were in before you started. And it’s a forward step you know you can actually take. A ship in port is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for. —Admiral Grace Murray Hopper Let’s be honest: failure can be frightening and uncomfortable—a true trial by fire. Thus it is with the element Fire that we associate the strategy of failing on the way to succeeding. Problems that require truly creative solutions are problems that you simply do not yet know how to solve. This book is all about being successful—even if and often because you fail first.

- How answers can lead to questions Every scenario and circumstance can provoke an endless list of valuable questions. Asking questions should not be reserved for moments when you don’t know an answer. Even when you do know the answer, asking, “What if … ?” is a great way to see more and delve deeper. If ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=923))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- you gained nothing else from your formal education but the mind-set of always asking, “What if … ?” then you would have benefited tremendously from your schooling. “What if … ?” questions invite you to see the world differently because those questions force you to challenge the status quo and to explore the limits of your understanding. The habit of framing questions helps you see what’s missing and thus see what needs creating. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=926))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Confident leaders in every profession are not afraid to ask the stupid questions. “Stupid,” of course, is not the appropriate adjective for these questions—we actually mean basic questions: the questions to which you may feel embarrassed about not already knowing the answers. A transformative but challenging personal policy is to never pretend to know more than you do. Don’t build on ambiguity and ignorance. When you don’t know something, admit it as quickly as possible and immediately take action—ask a question. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=939))

- If an exam is looming in your future, prepare by writing the test itself. Well beforehand, compose a list of good exam questions, put it away for a few days, and then later dig it out and take that mock test. Contemplating questions that you think should appear on the test will force you to ask, “What are the central ideas here and do I truly understand them?” And metaphorically write your own exam in other circumstances in which you are sharing information or skills, such as in preparing for an interview or a presentation. This “create-a-test” exercise is an excellent one to employ before you face an audience for a Q&A session. Do you know the material so well that you know what the good questions are? If you don’t, then you do not understand the material well enough, and you need to go deeper. The questions will help you uncover weak points as well as place what you are saying into a larger context. Remember: If you can’t create the questions, you’re not ready for the test.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Sadly, many people spend their entire lives focusing on the wrong questions. They may pursue money, when they really want happiness. They may pursue the respect of people whose favor is really not worthy of being sought. So before you succumb to the temptation to immediately spring to work on the answer, always stop and first ask, “What’s the real question here?” Often the question that seems obvious may not be the question that leads to effective action. Personal questions such as “How can I be successful?” or “How can I ace my exam?” or societal questions such as “Why do African Americans underperform on math tests?” are important, but they are not effective questions. Effective questions turn your mind in directions that lead to new insights and solutions. They highlight hidden assumptions and indicate directions to take to make progress. So what’s wrong with the previous three questions, and how might we fix them? “How can I be successful?” is vague, and, until you first carefully define “successful,” it is unanswerable. You should first ask what success means for you and then pose questions that lead to action. When you ask about success, are you really asking about making money? If so, are you making a hidden assumption? Is a Wall Street banker who is fabulously wealthy, but unhappy, successful? Is an artist who lives in poverty, never sells a painting, but loves his art, successful? You must define success for yourself. Only then will you be able to ask the right ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1043))

- questions about how you can be successful. The effective questions you will ask about success will lead you to explore and develop core values, habits, and skills that will make a difference. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1054))

- The right questions clarify your understanding and focus your attention on features that matter ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1066))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “Why do African Americans underperform on math tests?” Billions of dollars and much frustrating effort are spent trying to answer questions such as this. But it’s the wrong question. This question draws our attention to the wrong variable, namely, race, rather than the variables that actually impact the performance of any student of any race. Pertinent variables might include teaching methods, available resources, the amount of constructive help a student receives, the level of encouragement and motivation, study habits and attitudes, time on task, feeling of belonging and confidence during instruction, and the student’s history of success or failure. Questions concerning these themes and their relationship to any student’s success direct our attention in constructive ways. They point our minds toward features of reality that may have an impact on individual student performance, and that can possibly lead to useful interventions directed not at racially profiled populations, but at underperforming populations that include students of all races and ethnicities. Effective questions expose the real issue Seeking the right question forces you to realize that there are at least two kinds of ignorance: cases in which you know the right question but not the answer, and cases in which you don’t even know which question to ask.

- Improve the question From a student’s point of view, the question “How can I get better grades?” is not the most effective route to higher grades. Questions such as “How can I learn to think better and understand more deeply?” “How can I learn to communicate better?” “How can I increase my curiosity?” are far more constructive. For the questions below that are relevant to you, and more importantly for the ones you will create, craft more focused questions that might lead to a productive conclusion. Try to create questions that expose hidden assumptions, clarify issues, and lead to action. “How can I better manage my time?” “How can I land that dream job within the next four years?” “How can I attract this potential client?” “How can I quit a bad habit?” “How can I get my students to perform better?” Apply this exercise whenever you are confronted with a question in your own life—that is, constantly question your own questions.

- Final thoughts: The art of creating questions and active listening The right questions can be incredibly powerful tools for understanding and learning. Great questions can lead to insights that will make a difference. You can create great questions using concrete and straightforward techniques—questions that guide you and arouse your curiosity. Questions give us a breath of inspiration and insight; thus we associate the art of questioning with the element Air. Constantly thinking of questions is a mind-set with tremendous impact. You become more alive and curious, because you are actively engaged while you are listening and living. You become more open to ideas, because you are constantly discovering places where your assumptions are exposed. You take more effective action, because you clarify what needs to be done. Be your own Socrates. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1134))

- A way to provoke effective thinking … Think back Whenever you face an issue—whether an area of study or a decision about a future path—consider what came before. Wonder how the issue at hand landed in front of you. Ask where and what it was yesterday, a month ago, a year ago, and so forth. Everything, everyone has a history and evolves. Acknowledging that reality will allow you to generate new insights as well as create fruitful directions in which to move forward.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- in fact, only tiny variations of what has been thought before. If we look back on the history of inventions or the evolution of ideas, it may appear that there were moments of lightning-strike inspiration that led in totally new directions. But, as we saw with the birth of calculus, essentially every important brilliant idea can easily be seen to be the result of someone’s understanding what was already known and taking a small step to reveal the next idea—another variation on understanding simple things deeply. The difference between those who have great insights and those who don’t is that the first group actually take those baby steps. Students who embrace the mind-set that better ideas are literally right next door and that “one more small step will get me there” outperform those who believe that only the great minds make great progress. Taking these little steps can have tremendous implications for everything from writing essays and performing lab experiments to launching the next Internet craze.

- A way to provoke effective thinking … Extend ideas Take a good idea from any arena—work, society, or personal life. It need not be an idea you yourself originated. Now engage with that idea and extend it. The key is not to wonder whether the idea has extensions; it does. Your challenge is to find them.

- A way to provoke effective thinking … Once you have it, see if you can improve it Take an essay you’ve written or a solution to an issue and create a different, better one. Assume there is a mistake or omission or missed opportunity in your work—there always is! Now find it (yet another example of the insights we can gain by failing). This activity is much more challenging than it might at first appear. We are biased and limited by what we already know—especially since we know it works. However, moving beyond that bias can lead to new answers that, in turn, can lead to new insights and more effective solutions. People who make this evolutionary iteration a standard practice are far more successful in their education and in life than those who see an answer as an end.

What beliefs, cultural habits, opinions, or actions that are completely accepted today will be viewed as ridiculous by our grandchildren? What are some possible candidates?

- By analogy, your life has many major features—family, friends, education, professional situations, possessions, and more. Each of these elements is in flux. So you should not expect the “normal” state of affairs to be one in which everything is finished, perfect, and performing well. In reality, the normal state is one in which some features of life and learning are problematic and need attention. Acknowledge that reality and try to identify opportunities for improvement and growth.

You may dream of creating that one new idea that will solve lots of problems (and lead to fame and fortune). But the better dream is to see yourself standing on what seems to be the summit and climbing higher by taking one small step after another. That modest habit of effective thinking will help you accomplish things you never dreamed possible. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1396))

- It recommends that you adopt the habit of constructive change. Don’t be afraid to change any part of yourself—you’ll still be there, only better. Our colleague, Bill Guy, told us a story about an administrator who wanted to change a school. One year this headmaster decided to try to improve the instruction by having experts on teaching talk to the faculty members every month. After six months, the headmaster noticed that one of the teachers was not attending the sessions, so he called him in and asked, “Why haven’t you been attending the required seminars on how to teach better?” To which the teacher replied, “There’s no need for me to attend. I already know how to teach better than I do.” The first four elements enable you to think better than you do; learn better than you do; and be more creative ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1431))

- than you are. The fifth element recommends that you actually do it. Just do it. Adopt the habit of improvement, whether using our four elements or by any other methods that you find. If the ability to change is part of who you are, then you are liberated from worry about weaknesses or defects, because you can adapt and improve whenever you like.

- And now for something completely different. Grab a piece of paper and a pencil. Close your eyes tightly and write the sentence “I am writing as neatly as I can and any mistake I make is unintentional.” Now open your eyes and look at what you’ve written … it’s not perfect. Now repeat the exercise but this time with your eyes open. Your result will (hopefully) be much better. Writing with your eyes open is a different (and easier) task than writing with your eyes closed. There is a subtle perspective about improvement and about better performance that can alter how you approach the task of changing yourself. Namely, people who perform better can be viewed as actually doing a different task, rather than doing the same task better. If you play tennis, go to a court and have someone hit you a tennis ball. First, close your eyes and hit it back. Next, have your partner hit you a ball and watch it intently while you swing until it hits your… ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1441))

- doing the easier task of hitting the ball while watching it, rather than the more difficult task of hitting the ball by estimating its future location based solely on where it was at the moment it flew over the net. When plug-and-chug physics students apply formulas with no sense of what they mean or why they are true, those students are doing a difficult task—doing physics with their eyes closed. Students who understand the ideas behind the formulas are doing a different task. They are working with their eyes open. The better students are doing an easier task. Understanding the meaning and reasoning behind the formulas sometimes strikes students as an unnecessary and diversionary step. In reality understanding leads directly to easier future work and better results. When average students of history sit down to study for a test on the Second World War, they may be faced with memorizing facts such as lists of countries that were allied with each other. The country names may be just words. The groupings may seem arbitrary. But if those students learned what led to that moment, if they saw the maps, if they understood the transportation and communication methods of the time, if… ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008JUVDUE&location=1449))

- facts rather than the original smaller list of historical events of World War II. However, our point is that learning the flow of history—or any subject—makes each part far more stable and meaningful. Ironically, memorizing a smaller number of isolated facts is harder. Suppose you had to memorize the following list of words: HORSE ORDER BECAUSE EASY IN WE BEFORE SENTENCE A DID LOGICAL IS Wouldn’t it be easier and faster to memorize the following longer list of words? THIS SENTENCE IS EASY TO REMEMBER BECAUSE THE WORDS APPEAR IN A LOGICAL ORDER; THAT IS, WE DID NOT PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. The answer is, yes; because the surrounding context gives meaning to the otherwise meaningless, discrete words. Individuals who are more successful at anything are performing their task with their eyes open; that is, the activity they are doing is different from the activity that less successful people are undertaking.

In a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks. —Warren Buffett To become more skillful and successful, you might think in terms of altering what you do, rather than thinking in terms of how well you do it. Instead of thinking, “Do it better,” think, “Do it differently.” If you want to learn a subject, instead of memorizing rules and facts, concentrate on truly understanding the fundamentals deeply.
