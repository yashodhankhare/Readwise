## Highlights
- IS THERE ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT MEN? The question is provocative today, because hardly anyone dares to suggest that men are superior to women in any respect. Political correctness permits us to say that women are better than men at one thing or another. But it’s mostly taboo even to suggest men are better at anything more important than opening jars and killing bugs. In this book, I develop a somewhat radical theory about men and women. It holds that differences are rooted mainly in tradeoffs. If one gender is better at something, the superior ability will probably be linked to being worse at something else. Otherwise, it would be reasonable to expect that nature would have made both genders equally good at most things. That is not the main point, however. I intend to go far beyond the questions of who is better at what. We want to know not just what men are good at—but also what men are good for.

- One of the most important traits that make us human is our ability to create and sustain giant social systems that can evolve and adapt and compete against each other. These systems are called cultures. I shall suggest that cultures routinely exploit men in certain ways, which is to say cultures find men more useful than women for certain tasks. We shall ask what those tasks are and why cultures pick men for those. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=68))

- To simplify broadly, two main explanations have been put forward for why men have dominated culture and ruled the world. The first was accepted nearly everywhere until the twentieth century: that men were naturally superior to women. The forces that created human beings, whether they involved a divine power or the natural processes of evolution (or some combination), made men to be better and created women to help and serve men. The second explanation was a reaction against the first. It said that women were not inferior to men on any meaningful dimension. Possibly women are superior, but definitely not inferior. Therefore, the difference in social standing had to be explained as oppression. Men must somehow be working together to keep women down. Men devised a clever system for themselves, called patriarchy, and they used it to share rewards and to oppress women. This book offers a third explanation.

- It’s not that men are smarter than women (the first theory). It’s not that men are wicked conspirators against women (the second theory). It’s about some basic likes and dislikes. It’s rooted in how men treat other men, and how that is different from the way women relate to other women. It’s about how culture works. Due to an accident that just happened to be lucky for men, culture grew out of the way the men related to each other, more than out of women’s relationships. There were crucial tradeoffs: Women’s relationships were vital for some other things. Just not for constructing large systems, like a market economy, or a large team. Because culture grew out of men’s relationships—including competition, trading and communicating with strangers, and ample doses of violence—men were always in charge of it. Gradually things are changing. Women have asked, and occasionally demanded, to be allowed into the giant systems that men built, and to varying degrees they have been let in. Meanwhile, there are hardly any places in the world where men are asking (or demanding) to be allowed into giant social systems built up by women. That in itself is not surprising, because such systems hardly exist. But the lack of such female-created social systems is something worth pondering.

- If there is a message, it’s that it would be better for men and women to appreciate each other’s contributions more. Men and women have been partners throughout human history, mostly working together for the good of both. As partners, they have often done quite different things, thereby making different contributions to each other’s welfare. That, after all, is how nearly all partnerships work. A bit of mutual gratitude would be quite appropriate. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=110))

- Feminist theory has had the unfortunate side effect of accustoming us all to thinking of gender in terms of conflict: mainly men oppressing women, and men being threatened by female successes. Instead, I think men and women for the most part work together. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=117))

- Quite possibly both the old and the new views have something to them. In her book Who Stole Feminism? Christina Hoff Sommers argued that the feminist movement had indeed changed from a men-welcoming, idealistic movement promoting one kind of utopia into an antagonistic and often stridently anti-male movement.

- Rather, my argument is with a certain stereotyped feminist outlook. I am arguing not with actual feminists, but with feminists as they are perceived by men. Let me therefore introduce a character, the Imaginary Feminist, who will crop up from time to time to remind us of the established wisdom. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=177))

- Again, I freely admit she doesn’t speak for all feminists (as if anybody does). She represents the sorts that men notice the most. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=183))

- The same logic applies, with roles reversed, to the way men today perceive feminists. No doubt there are many women who identify themselves as feminists yet who do not hate men and may even like them, who may believe in equal opportunity for everyone rather than advancing the cause of their gender at the expense of men, who believe in telling the truth even if it is not favorable to their cause, and who do not resort to moral intimidation to silence men and dominate any debate. Yet these are not the feminists who stand out to men. The confrontational minority of feminists act as if they represent all feminists (indeed all women), and men have had much more contact with them than with the more harmoniously and peaceably inclined ones, precisely because they are outspoken and confrontational. It is with their views that I will occasionally need to take issue. They are the ones for whom the Imaginary Feminist speaks.

- What they said, and what research evidence also shows (if anyone had bothered to look before attributing parental choices to sexism), is that girl babies are generally easier than boy babies. Not always, of course, but often enough to account for the pattern we are describing. Many couples are apprehensive as the birth of their first child approaches. How will their lives change? Will they be good parents? Will they be able to cope? And then a sweet little girl baby arrives. A bit of adjustment here and there, and the couple thinks, hey, this is not bad at all! What was everyone warning and complaining about? Having a baby is easy and so very satisfying. Let’s have another! Boy babies are more trouble. They scream and cry more often than girl babies, and louder too. (Incidentally, this well-documented finding has been recognized as an important challenge to the conventional claim that females are more emotional than males.) Once they start crawling and walking, they get into things. They make bigger messes. They climb the furniture and pull the draperies. They fight with other kids. Parents who have boys think, this is difficult. Let’s not have any more of these. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=232))

- My Chinese colleagues pointed out that Chinese tradition and law stipulate that a son is responsible for taking care of his parents in their old age. A daughter is not. If your son does not provide for you, you can sue him, and there were such cases in the courts, as reported in the newspapers I read while I was there. You cannot sue your daughter, though. In a society that does not have reliable pensions, Social Security, and other provisions for the elderly, this is extremely important. The desire for a son is not necessarily a sign of some irrational bigoted hatred of the female gender. It may simply be a prudent concern with who is going to feed you when you are too old to work. You can’t count on your employer or the government to do it. You can’t even force your daughter to do it. But you can force your son to do it. The law and tradition are themselves quite relevant to one theme of this book. Males are required to support their parents, while females are exempt from this requirement. This is not to say that Chinese society is full of laws that favor females across the board. But it is one small sign of what we shall focus on in this book, namely how societies choose to use men. If that law applied to women and not men, our Imaginary Feminist would quickly use the word “exploit,” as in society is exploiting women by making them do things that it does not require men to do. If we want to understand gender and culture, we need to have our eyes open to how society exploits men as well as women. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=247))

- I shall propose that men and women are different in some basic ways and that some cultures—successful ones—capitalize on these differences to outperform rival cultures. The Imaginary Feminist asks, why not matriarchy? Why can’t women rule? I say, yes, why not? Whatever works is likely to be tried, eventually, and what works best will prevail over rival systems. It has been tried. Unfortunately, those matriarchal cultures and societies did not stand the test of time. There is probably a good reason. In fact, I shall suggest that women can rule, and even quite effectively. But usually they don’t. It’s not a matter of competence or capability. More likely, it has to do with the willingness to take the risks and make the sacrifices that are involved in competing for power. To understand why men and women have the lives they do, it is necessary to move beyond thinking of them as enemies. A more useful way of thinking will include at least three entities rather than the duo of men against women. The third is the cultural system itself. The system is not exactly an independent force. But humans use systems to make their lives better. In other writings, I have gone so far as to conclude that culture is humankind’s biological strategy. It is how people attempt to solve the basic biological problems that all species face: survival and reproduction. We have culture, a system that shares information, coordinates different tasks, and increases wealth. In general, we live vastly better in culture than we would live if we were suddenly left by ourselves in the forest and had to scrape by with our own muscles and wits.

- The system uses people in different ways. People put up with this because, mostly, they are better off with it than without it. True, the system is created by people, but they also experience it as beyond their power to control. We may try to change our culture by voting, but that exercise reveals how little control we really have. You can vote in every election all your life and still remain dissatisfied with your culture. This book seeks to understand the relationships and interactions among men, women, and culture. Even that simple triangle is not a complete explanation, however. Most cultures have had to compete against other cultures. To survive, a culture has to do more than provide decent lives for the men and women in it. It may have to accumulate the wherewithal to compete against other cultures. Competition can be economic, military, technological, or intellectual. Often it has been simply demographic: Larger groups typically prevail over smaller ones. In short, cultures have challenges. To survive, they must use their men and women effectively. That does not necessarily mean using men and women in the same ways. In fact, most cultures have used men and women in somewhat different ways.

- The Imaginary Feminist gets quite angry at any insistence that culture victimizes men, and she would point to evidence of male rule. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=294))

- Hence the question, once again: How can you say men are exploited, if they run everything? The answer to this is important, because it opens the door for many of the other points this book will make. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=299))

- The mistake in that way of thinking is to look only at the top of society and draw conclusions about society as a whole. Yes, there are mostly men at the top. But if you look at the bottom, really at the bottom, you’ll find mostly men there too. These are the worst outcomes society has to confer. And in each case, men far outnumber women.

- Men are more expendable than women, at least from the perspective of the cultural system. Actually, this will be one of the keys to understanding the different ways that culture uses men and women. The idea has several roots, some as deep as the basic ability to make babies for the next generation, to enable cultures to compete simply by outnumbering their rivals: a culture needs only a few men but as many women as possible.

- Yes, there are more men than women at the top of society, but there are also far more men than women at the bottom. The two are related. Society uses men and women differently. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=342))

- Probably the one-sided conventional view had its roots in the feminist critique of society as patriarchy, which is to say a conspiracy by men to exploit women. Feminists have acknowledged that they look at the world from women’s point of view. Sitting there, they looked up toward the top. They saw men at the top, and they thought, men are in charge of things, wow, it must be great to be a man. Society must be set up to benefit men.

- They are right that men are generally in charge of things. These men may have some problems, but it is quite fair to say that they enjoy a large share of the rewards society has to offer. In that sense, some men really do have it good. It is even correct to say that throughout most of history (things may be slowly changing now), the men at the top have enjoyed rewards and benefits better than those women could hope to attain. But the other conclusions —that it’s therefore great to be a man, and society is set up to benefit men—are biased by the error of ignoring the downside. One of the most interesting books about gender in recent years was by Norah Vincent. She was a lesbian feminist who with some expert help could pass for a man, and so she went undercover, living as a man in several different social spheres for the better part of a year. The book, Self-Made Man, is her memoir. She is quite frank that she started out thinking she was going to find out how great men have it and write a shocking feminist expose of the fine life that the enemy (men) was enjoying. Instead, she experienced a rude awakening of how hard it is to be a man. Her readings and classes in Women’s Studies had not prepared her to realize that the ostensible advantages of the male role come at a high cost. She was glad when it was over, and in fact she cut the episode short in order to go back to what she concluded was a greatly preferable life as a woman. The book she wrote was far different from the one she planned, and any woman who thinks life is better for men will find it a sobering read.

- The fact that men outnumber women at both the top and bottom of society is an important clue to how culture uses the genders differently. Although in modern society women can be found in just about all walks of life, men still outnumber them at the extremes, and in the past this difference has been even greater. It is simple but misleading to focus on one aspect and concentrate on that. Unfortunately, that’s what conventional wisdom has done. If you follow the popular media, you see and hear plenty about the gender gap in pay and the general unfairness about women earning less than men. Meanwhile, you will see and hear very little about the gender gap in occupational death. I have yet to see anyone writing that it’s unfair for men to be killed so much more often than women. Very likely, those two gaps have some link. Society has to pay people more to take dangerous jobs. All else being equal, would you take a job that carried a significant risk of being killed or maimed, rather than a job with no such risks? Of course not. But there are such jobs, and the culture needs somebody to do them. It knows nobody will choose such jobs if all else is equal—so it has to make all else not equal. The standard way to do that is with pay. Society increases the pay for dangerous jobs in order to get people to take them. This is called a tradeoff. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=369))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Tradeoffs will be important throughout this book. In fact, I think gender theory needs to acknowledge tradeoffs much more than it has. Consider, then, the tradeoff of money and danger. Suppose you were contemplating two jobs, identical in most respects, but one of which had a higher risk of injury and death. On that basis, as I’ve said, any rational person would choose the safe job. But now suppose the employer for the dangerous job was willing to increase the salary. How much more money would you want to compensate you for a slight increase in risk? Most likely, you would accept a slight increase in risk for a huge increase in salary. (After all, every time you drive on the highway you accept a slight risk of being killed, but the anticipated benefits of the trip make it worth it.) Therefore, the question becomes one of trading off money against risk: how much more money versus how much increase in risk. Confronted with such tradeoffs, men and women tend to see different tipping points. I’m sure it is possible to pay the average woman enough extra to make her willing to take more risk. But the average man will take that same risk for a smaller increase in salary. And so the employing organizations tend to stop there. Many research studies have shown that men put more emphasis on money when choosing jobs and careers than women do. As a result, these men earn more than the women who took the safer careers. As another result, some of these men will end up injured or killed, more so than the women who took the safer careers. Taking and doing those dangerous jobs is thus one thing men are good for. That is one way that most cultures use men more than women. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=379))

- To be sure, men still outnumber women as top achievers in some domains. Does that mean that in some respects men are better than women? Hardly. We have all been taught to dismiss superior male achievement as evidence of prejudice and oppression. Some do feel bad for the men, especially the young guys today, because they can’t win. When men do worse than women, people say it’s because women are better at this or that. When men do better than women, people say it’s because women are oppressed, presumably by men, and so men are evil. Either way, men end up looking bad.

- The point is that in the past, most people thought men were better than women—precisely the opposite of now. No doubt, the endless stream of stories about female superiority are still feeding off of this (increasingly quaint) assumption of male superiority. In essence, we have been rebelling against the assumption of male superiority by going to the opposite extreme. After all, one of the great themes of the women’s movement has been that women aren’t inferior to men. Going back a bit in time, both men and women shared the assumption that men were superior. The most optimistic advocates of women thought that women could be almost as good as men at most things. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=453))

- This idealistic belief in how to fix parental prejudice led to one of the great surprises of my generation. As students, we learned and embraced the idea that gender inequalities and even gender differences were all due to socialization and so that if we simply treated our sons and daughters the same, they would grow up the same. A generation of modern, enlightened parents tried this as best they could. Surprise! It didn’t work. In one fairly typical story, two of my professional colleagues gave their five-year-old daughter a truck and their two-year-old son a big doll for Christmas, thereby reversing any stereotypical influences and teaching them that it was all right to play with different toys. The parents congratulated themselves on how progressive and forward-thinking they were, but it didn’t last long. “They just swapped,” as the adults tell the story with a mild laugh and shrug. Apparently there wasn’t even any negotiation or discussion between the two little ones. Each just immediately preferred the other toy and somehow knew the other was feeling the same way. Since the late 1970s, the field has largely taken the view that women are superior, and men are an inferior copy. In essence, it is the same approach that was used before 1960, but with the genders switched. Now women are the model and the ideal, and men are seen as the flawed version of the human species. So we have had three different prevailing theories: men better than women, no difference, and women better than men. These require a bit of comment before we get to the fourth possible theory.

- Obviously, an aspiring science such as psychology loses credibility when it just shifts from one theory to the opposite without convincing evidence. How could psychology jump from men being superior to women being superior? Part of the answer is that psychology’s switch mirrored what was happening in the society at large, but that doesn’t really answer the question. To begin with, how could society switch so fast? The answer will provide a valuable first lesson about one important, basic difference between men and women. The next several sections will develop this point.

- The main research finding toward which his detractors can point, I believe, is that on average, women and men are equally intelligent. Average IQ scores are about the same in men as in women. (Throughout childhood, girls score higher than boys, and then the boys catch up and move very slightly ahead in adulthood.) Anyone who says that on average men are meaningfully smarter than women overall is wrong. Depending on which studies you cite and how small a difference you will accept, there is either no difference at all or such a small difference that it is meaningless for practical purposes.

- But Summers did not actually say that men are smarter than women. Nor did he say men are better at math and science than women are. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=528))

- Math and science ability, like intelligence generally, is distributed along a continuum, with plenty of average people in the middle and small numbers scattered at the extremes. What Dr. Summers said was that at the high end—where the math and science genius-level intellects are found—there are more men than women. This doesn’t mean that men are on average smarter than women, though it could have meant that. After all, if men and women are found in roughly equal numbers all along the distribution except at the genius level, then the male average IQ would be higher. But a surplus of men at the high end could also mean that there are more men at both extremes. It is possible to have more male than female geniuses even if the average IQ for men and women were exactly the same to the tenth decimal place—provided there are also more men than women at the other extreme, that is, with very low intelligence. In other words, it is statistically possible that there are more super-smart men than women, if there are also more hugely stupid men than women. The crucial test case, therefore, is to look at the extreme low end. No one in the Summers debate brought this up or even asked whether there are more males at the bottom of the IQ distribution. The data about low intelligence are indisputable, and far more definite than the data on genius, simply because researchers study mental retardation far more than they study giftedness.

- There are more mentally retarded boys than girls. No matter what test or population you study, there are always more males. There’s no way around it. At the extreme low end of intelligence, males outnumber females. In fact, as you move from the mildly retarded levels to the most severely retarded, the gender difference gets bigger—further evidence that it’s a real effect. And, crucially, that is the same pattern found with genius: as you go from mild to moderate to extreme, there are fewer and fewer girls relative to the number of boys. Super-genius and severely retarded are both mostly boys’ clubs, though a few exceptional girls do show up too. All those retarded boys are not the handiwork of patriarchy! There is no conspiracy by men to make each other’s sons mentally retarded. Somehow it just happens that there are more retarded boys than girls. Nor is it some unlucky stereotype or the product of biased socialization. Nobody tries to bring up their children to be retarded. No parent wants to have a mentally handicapped child, whether a son or a daughter. The familiar litany of… ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=540))

- If the oversupply of retarded boys is not the result of men defending patriarchy, then quite likely the oversupply of genius boys isn’t either. The most likely explanation is that some strong influence of Mother Nature produces both extremes. Something in the biology of maleness produces more cases at both extremes. (More about that later.) Now, let’s not overstate the case. There are plenty of female geniuses, just like there are plenty of mentally retarded females. Women can be found across the entire spectrum of intelligence, from the very top to the very bottom. But, in general, women cluster more in the middle, whereas men are spread out a little more to the extremes. On this, Dr. Summers was quite right, at least in the sense of having a solid scientific basis for what he said. Put another way, the average man and the average woman are almost exactly… ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=550))

- Men and women are thus alike in that both are distributed with the greatest numbers in the middle range and fewer at the extremes. But there are more men than women at the extremes. (And so there are slightly fewer men than women at the middle.) This pattern will be found repeatedly, when you measure many different things. Though it sometimes does not occur, it is there often enough that we need to be alert to it. What causes the male extremity pattern? We revisit the question later. It has roots in both nature and culture, and it has implications for the differences in how culture exploits men versus how it exploits women.

- In point of fact, in America today, women score higher grades than men in college and earn lower salaries. It is possible that there could be different causes. But that is all the more reason not to leap to conclusions. When these differences are mentioned in the mass media, they tend to get treated as if they point toward very different conclusions. It is common to infer from women’s better grades that women are better students and perhaps even smarter than the men. Meanwhile, the higher earning power of men is not taken to mean that men are better workers than women. It is usually ascribed to some kind of evil conspiracy by men (patriarchy), and many people quickly think the gender gap in salary is proof of male wickedness and the oppression of women. Some argue that laws are needed to require women to earn as much as men. Maybe. Let me point out that, in principle, one could just as well draw the opposite conclusions. Suppose someone were to say that women do better in college because colleges and the schools leading up to them discriminate against the young men and try extra hard to benefit the young women. The same person could say that men get higher salaries because they perform better than women in their jobs, or that they choose jobs that pay more, or because they work longer hours, or whatever. My point is that neither conclusion is really justified. Until we rule out the very serious possibility that male extremity alone produces those differences, we cannot and should not conclude for certain that something else is responsible. Both the lower grades and the higher salaries of men could be nothing more than a statistical quirk stemming from male extremity.

- The Theory We’ve Never Tried So theorizing about gender differences has featured three of the four possible theories. Once upon a time, and not so very long ago, it embraced the view that men were superior to women. The currently dominant view is that women are superior to men. And at times there have been strong arguments that there are no real or innate differences, just stereotypes and superficial differences caused by different upbringing. What’s missing from that list? Different but equal is what hasn’t been tried. In this view, neither gender is superior to the other across the board. But there are real differences. It’s just that the differences cancel out in important ways. This may sound like a namby-pamby compromise designed to please everyone. It is nothing of the sort. My argument for equality is an important basis for my broader argument about how culture exploits men. Cultures exploit men and women differently. And they do this for a practical reason. Men and women are different and hence are useful to culture in different ways. If there were no differences, then men and women would be interchangeable. Even if it were established that having different gender roles is helpful and useful for a culture—which I think is correct—it wouldn’t really matter which gender played which role. Suppose most cultures needed somebody to fight in battles and also needed somebody to take care of the babies, and suppose (perhaps for obvious reasons) these tasks don’t mix well, so it is best to assign them to different genders. We’d expect that some cultures would use men to take care of the babies and the women to fight the battles. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=647))

- But if the genders are different, then successful cultures will figure out which gender is better suited to which of its tasks, and assign them thus. The “different but equal” is a radical theory of gender equality. It gets to equality not by sameness but by tradeoffs. Differences survive because of these tradeoffs, in which a particular trait is well suited for one kind of task or contribution but its opposite has value for a different kind of task or contribution.

- The battle and baby issue is just one example. I don’t mean to link everything to that. But it is chosen to illustrate an important point: tradeoffs. My strong impression is that modern social scientists, and probably modern citizens in general, do not adequately recognize how pervasive tradeoffs are. I can’t prove it, and it’s only an impression. But there is a relentless quest to find the right fix, the right mix, the single solution to any problem. Why do we keep needing new laws? Shouldn’t there be enough laws by now? But fixing one problem often creates another. Often there is no single correct solution to a social problem. That is because of tradeoffs. The better you make things in one respect, the more of a problem you create in something else. My radical theory of gender equality is based on tradeoffs. It means that there are real differences in the abilities of the two genders. But they are linked. Specifically, being better at one thing is linked to being worse at something else.

- Every time you hear of one gender being better at something, stop to think what is on the other side of that coin. What inferiority is tied to that superiority? ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=688))

- The tradeoff theory of gender says there are real, innate differences between men and women, including differences in capabilities and in inclinations. To say the differences are innate means that they are rooted in biology, that people are born with these differences (at least as tendencies). Perhaps these inborn tendencies can be overcome in some cases, but men and women start off different. Culture can reduce the effects of nature, but in most cases, culture builds on nature. Small natural differences in inclination may become giant differences in society, such as ones in which women are all kept at home to care for children and men are all required to earn a living. Biologically based differences are put there by evolution. Evolution proceeds across generations, because the more successful versions do better than their rivals. They live longer and better and, most important, they reproduce more. This is why it is implausible that one gender is innately better than the other across the board. When there is a good way to be, everyone will be it. Two legs are better than one or three, and so everybody has two legs. (Across multiple species, there are of course many four-legged and six-legged varieties, but I know of no mammals having an odd number of legs.)

- Evolution thus naturally eliminates differences in favor of making every member resemble the better version. Evolution will, however, preserve differences across many generations under one very specific condition: when there is a tradeoff. If it is always better to be A than B, then gradually the members of the species with trait A will survive and reproduce better than the ones with trait B, until eventually most or even all the newborn babies have trait A instead of B. However, if the A trait is better for some things while its opposite, B, is better for others, then there will be no permanent evolutionary victor. Both A and B will continue to reproduce and occur in each new generation. Every time you hear that one gender is better than the other, ask yourself: Why would nature make one gender better than the other? Why would it preserve that difference, especially since the two genders mix their genes every single time a baby is made? Again, if there is a difference, most likely it is tied to a tradeoff. Nature will make one gender better at one thing, and keep it that way, if not having that ability makes people better able to do something else—indeed, something else that is too valuable to give up. We are almost ready to start asking what these differences are. Then we can survey the differences between men and women with an eye to asking what nature and culture are likely to find men good for.

- Things heated up in the late 1960s and especially in the early 1970s, as the women’s movement and other changes called more attention to women. A landmark in the field was the publication in 1974 of Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin’s book The Psychology of Sex Differences. Those two scholars had combed through volumes of studies and collected the many findings of gender differences that had been reported, often without much comment, in study after study. The effect was something like having somebody go out searching for a few coins underneath the seats at a movie theatre and return with thousands of dollars’ worth.

- The new analysis allowed them to ask, how big is that difference? The tables turned rather abruptly when the new tool was applied to gender differences. Yes, as Maccoby and Jacklin had documented, there are many gender differences to be found, because men and women are different in a vast number of ways. But most of these differences turned out to be quite small. Often gender accounted for only 3% to 5% of the variation in behavior. It was rare for a difference to reach 10%.

- Elizabeth Aries put this succinctly in her 1995 book that was a sweeping reappraisal of gender differences based on the size of the effects. She noted the popularity of works by authors such as Deborah Tannen and John Gray, who treated men and women as opposites—indeed, in the case of Gray’s works, as from different planets (men from Mars, women from Venus). “Why have we constructed polarized conceptions of men and women when the similarities between them outweigh the differences?” Aries asked.

- The new view, therefore, is that men and women are different in many respects—but most of these differences are so small as to be scarcely worth talking about. Even in important, sensitive domains like mathematical aptitude, effect sizes changed the discussion. It was true that across the USA, the results from many thousands of SAT tests showed that boys on average have a higher aptitude for math than girls—but the difference was only about 3%. That’s hardly enough to justify a company saying they would prefer to hire a man rather than a woman for a numbers-crunching job, or even enough reason to advise your daughter to take biology instead of physics.

- How well someone performs a task depends on two things about the person (plus some external factors such as luck). One is the person’s ability. The other is how hard the person tries. The latter, effort, is largely a reflection of the broad category of motivation. In plain language, motivation means wanting. Thus, in a nutshell, performance depends on two things, ability and motivation. Ability is what you can do. Motivation is what you want to do. All the ability in the world won’t lead to success in, say, basket-weaving or race-car driving, if you aren’t interested in engaging in that sphere of endeavor.

- Motivation is somewhat neglected in psychology these days, for complicated reasons that have little to do with its importance. The field of gender differences is likewise more attuned to abilities than motivation. It carries on hot debates about whether men or women are better at something. Somehow, the question of whether men or women differ in what they like to do is not debated as often or as intensely.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So before we go too far down the path of analyzing gender differences as traded off abilities, let’s look elsewhere. Where might that be? As we have just seen, performance depends on not just ability but also on motivation. So perhaps if men and women don’t differ much in ability, they will differ more in motivation. There are several advantages to focusing on motivation when we talk about differences between men and women. For one thing, it’s less poisonous to discuss. If men and women do different things, it’s more a reflection of what they like and want to do, than of what they are capable of. Policy implications are also muted. If you thought women were less competent than men at something, you might be justified in not wanting to hire one. But if the differences arise because most women don’t like to do something, then the one who’s applying for your job is obviously different, and you don’t need to worry.

- It’s worth revisiting the Lawrence Summers scandal with motivation in mind. The outrage that greeted his remarks is one sign of how sensitive people are about ability. The remark that caused so much trouble was the one about ability: He suggested that there were more men than women with the high innate ability needed to do physics at the level of a Harvard professor. He also said a little about motivation. Specifically, he suggested that fewer women than men were willing to put in the long hours and make the other sacrifices required for success in a highly demanding, highly competitive field. As far as I can make out, this comment didn’t attract much attention except a bit of grumbling about how tough it is for women to do that kind of work without adequate daycare or partners who share the housework. I didn’t see anybody talk about the basic idea of motivation to do math and science. And this is most likely where the biggest part of the problem is. (I use the word “problem” tentatively, because I’m not really convinced that the shortage of female physics professors at Harvard qualifies as a real problem. What, exactly, is the downside of having equations solved and neutrinos tracked by more men than women?) Almost everything said against Dr. Summers, and what little was said in his defense, as well as what was said subsequently by people attempting fresh and balanced approaches to the issue of women in science, focused on the question of whether women have less native ability than men to study science. Always ability. The whole argument about Summers and what he should be permitted to say and think was about ability. What if the lack of women in top science jobs isn’t a result of differences in ability after all? Could it be motivation? Maybe women can do math and science perfectly well. Maybe they just don’t like to. After all, most men don’t like math either. Only a small minority of people find it satisfying to work with numbers and equations and such things. Think about the people you know who do like that stuff. Most of them are guys. A few years ago, researcher Patricia Hausman, speaking to a meeting of the National Academy of Engineering, expressed a politically incorrect conclusion about why women don’t make their careers in the natural sciences. It’s neither because of a lack of ability nor because prejudice and oppression stop them. Her summation was apt: “They don’t want to.” If ability differences explained the shortfall of women in science and math, while motivation levels were the same, here’s what we’d see. Boys and girls, and later on men and women, would sign up for science classes in equal numbers (because signing up shows that they are interested). If abilities were different, then the females would flunk out while the males garnered the top grades and moved on. But that’s not what happens. Instead, it’s motivation. When women do take math and science, they generally do fine. But mostly they don’t sign up. That shows the… ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=817))

- Motivation, it concluded, was first and foremost: Women who have the ability to do well in math typically prefer non-science fields. Second, more men than women score in the top ranges on the major math aptitude tests. To the dismay of the Imaginary Feminist, the researchers concluded that evidence for discrimination (oppression) was mostly weak, dated, and anecdotal, and the more reliable data suggested this was not much of a factor, if any. The overall conclusion was that women’s preferences are the single strongest factor. To quote Professor Hausman again, “Wherever you go, you will find females less likely than males to see what is so fascinating about ohms, carburetors, or quarks.” She said that she finds people endlessly fascinating, just like other women do. But as for things, well, “things bore me!” And that’s the main reason women don’t flock into engineering, physics, chemistry, and other fields that seek to learn how things work.

- The point of this chapter is that differences between men and women— that is, the big, meaningful differences that have an impact on what happens in the world—are in motivation rather than ability.

- So, let’s ask first, is anybody making money off of gender differences in abilities? It’s hard to think of any. This is one clue that there aren’t a great many such differences. If women really had a seriously different level of ability for math or foreign language or whatever, there would be more classes aimed specifically at them, with different teaching styles. Ditto for men: there would be specialized classes, or perhaps products to address these problems. What about motivation? Here, it seems, plenty of people are making heaps of money based on the belief that men and women want and like different things. The entertainment industry is an under used source of clues to learn about motivation. Leisure and entertainment show what people like to do when they have no obligations and can just satisfy their own desires. In a sense, the entertainment industry ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=869))

- caters strongly and carefully to what people’s motivations are. Entertainment is based on motivation. Start with the magazine industry, which is a highly competitive field. To be sure, there are magazines that everybody reads. Still, there are also men’s magazines and women’s magazines. There are in fact plenty of both. Oddly, both of them tend to put pictures of women on the cover. Beyond that, however, the content is different. If men and women wanted to read about the same things, there would be no market for specialized magazines aimed at one or the other gender. There is, however, demonstrably a very big market. You can probably guess, and probably correctly, which types of stories go with which gender’s magazines: fashion tips; ball sports; celebrity gossip; power tools; guns; diets and recipes; home décor; and on and on. Magazines are hardly the only way that people make money off of gender differences in motivation. There are separate cable television channels aimed at male and female audiences, some even explicitly calling themselves “the women’s channel” or “entertainment for women.” Advertisements and commercials often aim at different genders. (If a woman mainly watches television by herself or with her female friends and then one day sits down to watch a ballgame with her husband, she’ll be surprised at how many beer and car ads there are.) Let’s not overstate the case. Men and women do have many similar motivations, and certainly the entertainment industry has plenty of gender-neutral offerings, from TV dramas to sea cruises. But the fact that there are many differences shows that gender differences in motivation have significant economic reality.

- Sex is another revealing and important sphere of behavior. People do complain a bit about a general lack of skill or technique in one or the other gender, but I doubt there is any far-reaching difference in sexual ability. In motivation, there is a difference. We’ll take a closer look at this in a later chapter devoted to sex. For now, the crucial point is simply that there are gender differences in sexuality, and they mostly involve motivation. As the critics of Lawrence Summers would be pleased to hear, there is not much evidence to argue that men and women have innately different abilities for having sex. The differences are to be found in desire. Men want sex more often than women. If anything, one can argue that women have a higher natural ability than men for sex. Women are more capable than men of having multiple orgasms. Women can have intercourse without being aroused, whereas men cannot. Women can continue performing sexually immediately after orgasm, whereas men must wait out a refractory period before they are ready to go again. If one chooses to regard these as ability differences, then they all suggest that women have higher ability. But men have higher motivation. Thus, one of the most basic and universal human motivations—the desire to have sex—differs by gender. This particular motivation is stronger among men than women. That’s probably why men still pay for dates, even in this modern era of ostensible liberation and equality. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=902))

- The phrase “glass ceiling” became popular for a while in discussions of differences in levels of business success. Hillary Clinton used it in 2008 to explain her failure to become President of the United States. The idea of a glass ceiling is that there are hidden conspiracies (a glass ceiling is an invisible barrier) among men to keep women down. There is no evidence that such conspiracies exist, apart from the lack of women at the top of many organizations. Moreover, most serious social scientists recognize that conspiracy theories are generally wrong, and this one should be considered quite dubious.

- Professor Fischer smiled and shrugged. It’s pretty obvious what’s going on, she said. Men and women start working as equals, but more men than women want to make it to the top. The people who make it to the top, both men and women, have those strong ambitions and care deeply about succeeding in their work—enough to make the personal sacrifices that are necessary. Some women care that much, and they do succeed. There’s no glass ceiling, she said, other than women’s own widespread unwillingness to put in the long hours of planning and working to make it to the top. Women who are willing to pay that price succeed too, just like the men. Recent research points increasingly to the same conclusion. The pharmacy industry, for example, is generally recognized as having essentially zero sex (or race) discrimination. Part of the reason is that there never seem to be enough people to take all the jobs, so anyone, male or female, can get the training and then pick, choose, and negotiate a job to his or her liking. Though men and women go into the field at similar rates, they tend to pick different kinds of jobs and careers. Women favor easier jobs with minimal travel and with fixed hours that can be accommodated to family life. Men tend to pick the jobs with greater responsibilities, longer hours, less flexible demands, but with higher earnings. Hence in this field, like many others, men on average earn 27% more than women. Actually, there are additional factors that have nothing to do with either glass ceiling conspiracies or hours worked. For one, men choose their jobs on the basis of money more than women do. Would you take a highly stressful and unpleasant job that paid a huge salary? More men than women say yes to this question. For another, men are more likely than women to negotiate for higher salaries. Multiple studies have documented this. When women get a salary offer, they tend to accept it. When men get one, they tend to bargain for a bit more. The same thing happens each year when raises are handed out. Men are more likely to make an argument about why they deserve more. Sometimes they succeed with this argument, sometimes not. But if you don’t try, you never succeed. Over the years, these small differences add up. All these things reflect motivation. Men want to succeed more, they work longer at it, they care about money more, they make decisions based on money more, they are more willing to make sacrifices to succeed, and they negotiate more extensively for money. No wonder they earn more. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=960))

- Remember the numbers on death on the job in Chapter 1? At last count, 93% of Americans killed on the job in an average year are men. That means that men take more dangerous jobs than women do. Do you think men like jobs that get them killed? More likely, they accept the danger because it comes with a higher salary. Societies everywhere have to pay people a bit more to get them to do dangerous jobs. It’s a tradeoff: safety versus money. And on average men and women trade it off a bit differently. It’s the motivation for money that is higher in men. Men will accept more risk than women in order to get a higher paycheck.

- Our tour of various motivational differences has been somewhat haphazard. The point was just to establish the conclusion that the differences between men and women are most likely based primarily in motivation. If culture is to use men and women differently, it will likely do so on the basis of the differing inclinations and preferences that men and women have. That raises the question, then, of what the centrally important differences are. The next two chapters will develop two big and key motivational differences.

- Here’s a riddle for you: What percentage of our ancestors were men? ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1001))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Let’s return now to the question of what percentage of our ancestors were women. Yes, each baby has one mother and one father, so each baby’s parents were 50% male. But some of those parents had multiple children, and not necessarily always with the same partner. Every baby’s parents are 50% male, but you can’t extrapolate from that to conclude that today’s human population has an ancestry that is 50% male. The correct answer has recently begun to emerge from DNA studies, notably those by Jason Wilder and his colleagues. They concluded that among the ancestors of today’s human population, women outnumbered men about two to one. Two to one! In percentage terms, then, humanity’s ancestors were about 67% female and 33% male. To illustrate how this could be possible, imagine a desert island at the start of time with just four people: Jack, Jim, Sally, and Sonya. Thus the population is 50% female. Let’s assume Jack is rich and handsome, while Jim is poor and unattractive, so Jack marries both Sally and Sonya. Thus, Jack and Sally’s baby, Doug, has ancestors who are 50% female (i.e., Jack and Sally). The same can be said for Jack and Sonya’s baby, Lucy. But if you take Doug and Lucy together, their combined ancestors are 67% female (because their total ancestors are Jack, Sally, and Sonya). Most people are surprised to hear that humankind today had twice as many female ancestors as male ones, because they thought it would be closer to 50:50. When experts hear about this, they are surprised too, but often for the opposite reason: They thought the imbalance would be even more severe. That is, they thought it would be maybe 75% to 85% female. Probably it was more severe through much of history, and especially prehistory. In many animal species, close to 90% of the females but only 20% of the males reproduce. The way the human population has ballooned in recent centuries means that most people who ever lived are either alive today or were alive recently, and in modern times the rule of monogamy has spread over large parts of the globe. In past eras, when polygamy (one husband, multiple wives) was the norm, the reproductive imbalance would have been even more severe. Hence whatever conclusions we draw about the differences between men and women based on the two-to-one ancestor difference are probably understatements. If we had done the research even just a few centuries ago, the ratio might have been three female ancestors to every male one, or four to one.

- What does it mean that we are descended from twice as many women as men? It can be explained like this. Of all the people who ever reached adulthood, maybe 80% of the women but only 40% of the men reproduced. Or perhaps the numbers were 60% versus 30%. But one way or another, a woman’s odds of having a line of descendants down to the present were double those of a man. Also, crucially, the majority outcome is different—the most common outcome of normal life. Most women who ever lived to adulthood probably had at least one baby and in fact have a descendant alive today. Most men did not. Most men who ever lived, like all the wild horses that did not ascend to the alpha male’s top spot, left behind no genetic traces of themselves. That’s a stunning difference. Of all humans ever born, most women became mothers, but most men did not become fathers. You wouldn’t realize this by walking through an American suburb today with its tidy couples. But it is an important fact. I consider it the single most under-appreciated fact about the differences between men and women. In Chapter 3 I mentioned that the crucial differences between men and women are more likely to be found in terms of what they want (motivation) than in their abilities. The dramatically greater proportion of women among our ancestors provides a vital basis for understanding some of these motivational differences. To appreciate these, it is necessary to consider exactly how evolution works. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1055))

- The term “survival of the fittest” is often erroneously repeated as a one-line summary of Darwin’s theory. The phrase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer, not Darwin. More important, though, it has now become regarded as misleading. Survival has come to be regarded as secondary by the recent generations of evolutionary theorists. Reproduction is the key. It’s all about reproduction. The bottom line in natural selection, which drives evolution, is reproducing., Actually, even that isn’t even quite precisely right. Oak trees produce thousands of acorns every year, but not all of them become trees, and many that start growing don’t survive to make more acorns and more trees. The real bottom line is making new babies who will succeed in making more babies. If you do that, you are a success in evolutionary terms at passing along your genes, regardless of how long you live. Followed to its extreme, we can look at the world population of human-kind today as the result of evolution. Many people have walked the Earth in the past couple hundred thousand years. Some of them passed along their genes, which continue to be reproduced in today’s population. Others were dead ends. Either they didn’t have children, or their children died before reproducing, or their grandchildren did. ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1073))

- The difference in reproductive success is crucially important. It provides a powerful basis for understanding why men and women act differently. Remember, if evolutionary theory is right about anything, it’s right about reproduction. That’s the core of the theory. Nature will most favor traits that lead to success at reproducing. But for thousands of years, men and women have faced vastly different odds and problems in reproducing. The psychology of men and women, at least as set up by evolution, thus starts from very different prospects. Nature made life to seek to create more life. On this basic task, women faced good odds of success, whereas men were born to face looming failure. We are descended, obviously, only from the women and men who succeeded, that is, the ones who passed on their genes. But men and women had to take different routes to success. It would be wrong to say it was easy for women, because childbirth and nursing placed heavy demands and took their toll. Nonetheless, throughout human history, women have seen the odds in their favor, while men have seen the odds against them. Nature molded the psyches of men and women accordingly. That’s a powerful basis for saying that men and women are built to want different things, in different ways. The men and women who lived before us may not have thought about it in those terms of success and failure, but nature was choosing among them by whether they succeeded, and today’s humankind is descended from the men and women who succeeded at passing on their genes. Today’s humanity therefore has the traits that went with success at reproducing. These traits would be different by gender. For a woman, the path to success seems to have been fairly straight. There was little reason to take chances or strike out on her… ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1086))

- Thus, most women who ever lived faced relatively favorable odds, and their psyches were correspondingly adapted to these favorable circumstances. Play it safe, be like everyone else, and there would be sufficient chances to become pregnant. She just had to choose a good offer, such as a man who could and would provide for her and the children. Life has handed you a good thing; don’t blow it. That’s nature’s message to women. Therefore, crucially, there was no need for nature to instill particular traits in a woman to increase her chances of having a baby. Nature didn’t have much need or opportunity to select among women in favor of traits that promoted having babies, because most women had babies. No extra drive, no special motivation, was needed. In contrast, the average man was destined for reproductive oblivion. The option of playing it safe and doing like everyone else would have been a foolish one. Most of the men would fail to reproduce, and if you failed to surpass them, you would fail too. That’s why we are descended from playing-it-safe women and risk-taking men. Later in the book we shall have occasion to consider questions like, why was it so rare for fifty women to band together to build a ship and sail off into unknown seas to explore? The fact that men instead of women did this is a cause of gender differences in wealth, power, and other things, as we shall see. But remember the most underappreciated fact. From the perspective of nature and evolution, reproduction is the bottom line. Women who sailed off into unknown parts were probably less likely than others to pass on their genes. It would be foolish for women to take such chances. They might drown or be eaten by cannibals or succumb to strange new diseases. Instead, stay home and act like the rest of the women, and you will get to have your babies. But for men the calculus was different. For the man to stay at home and play it safe was not playing it safe, because the average man was not destined to reproduce. Yes, many men who sailed off to explore unknown seas ended up drowning, or being eaten by cannibals, or dying from disease, and they lost their gamble. But gambling was still the best strategy perhaps, because staying at home for them also meant losing. Some men did come back from their travels rich enough to improve their chances of getting a wife or two and supporting a pack of youngsters. You can argue, philosophically, which life was preferable: to stay at home, safe and reasonably comfortable, go through life, not reproduce, and die peacefully, versus go out into the world and risk much and suffer, yet, as one of the lucky ones, come home rich, take a wife or two, and have sons and daughters. But which life is preferable is not the point. People today are descended from the men who did take the gamble (and who won). The psychology of men who live today, to the extent it has any genetic or biological basis, leans toward the highly ambitious man. To put it another way,… ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1102))

- Let us suspend value judgments for a moment. This impulse to compete, to try to best the other at some physical task, seems to come more naturally to the male than to the female of the species. Assuming both men and women have sound reasons for feeling the ways they do, why might that difference exist?

- But that is what it means to be male. It has its roots in the most underappreciated fact. Most men who ever lived have been genetically erased from the human population. The men who didn’t care about outdoing other men, who were content to take it easy and go along easily and let others push ahead (the way many women are content)—those guys did not reproduce. The men who pushed ahead were more likely to reproduce, and today’s men are descended from them. To leave offspring, you had to outdo other men. Women did not face those long odds. To the extent that women competed with each other, they competed to get a better versus less desirable mate. And they did this not by besting other women at physical tasks, but by being more beautiful and sweet and lovable than the others. The relentless competitive urge is one difference we notice about the sexes, and I certainly concur with the general impression that the relentless male competitiveness can be downright annoying. Women seek to make friends and make others feel good and get along. All that is much nicer than trying to outdo each other on every little task that comes along. But men are descended from men who did manage to outperform other men. The sad fact, as we have seen, is that the nice guys often did not pass on their genes. The men who competed ruthlessly managed to get to the top of the hierarchy, where they could have their pick of the females (and maybe have several). They produced sons (and daughters). The nice guys who were pleasant and easygoing and who didn’t care so much about outdoing the other men achieved less, attracted fewer females, and left behind fewer descendants. We saw in the first chapter that pretty much everybody likes women more than men. My theory is that women really are more lovable than men. Men can be lovable too. After all, most men do persuade women to love them. It’s just they don’t always want to be lovable. For women, being liked and loved is a top priority most of the time. Men would like to be liked and loved, but they have other goals too, and sometimes those other goals take priority. Men want to fight their way to the top. Don’t get me wrong. Women would like to be at the top of the hierarchy also. It’s just that when there is a choice between being nice and lovable as opposed to battling one’s way to the top, women are more likely to choose being nice and lovable, whereas more men would opt for fighting to the top. All of this, I suggest, is rooted in our evolutionary history, especially the most underappreciated fact. Women had babies whether they fought their way to the top or not. Being lovable is what enabled women to have better quality babies. In contrast, men had more babies and better quality ones if they fought their way to the top. Being lovable may have mattered for men too, but not as much. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1176))

- For today’s man, the link to reproduction has been severed. Monogamy and other factors ensure that less successful men can have children, while even the most successful men, because of the monogamy laws, may have only one or two. Perhaps ironically, or as a spiteful victory of culture over nature, today’s downtrodden, unproductive, and feckless men often produce more children than sophisticated, wealthy, well-educated, successful men. Of course, individual men don’t regard making babies as their overriding goal, even if evolution has molded them to do things that happen to produce more children. Biology has not made men want children as much as they want sex. Biology managed to get men to participate in reproducing the species by making them desire sex, regardless of babies. Acting on that inclination, men have invented ways of having sex without making babies (another victory of culture over nature!). Successful men do not necessarily want to have a hundred babies, but they often do want to have sex with a hundred women. And the culture they have created cooperates. Today’s highly successful men have multiple sex partners (perhaps not a hundred, though some do), but often they carefully avoid having a bumper crop of babies. Indeed, the norms and laws that promote monogamy mean that successful men must conceal their sexual dalliances, and toward that end preventing pregnancy is vital. So natural selection and the tough reproductive odds have ensured that modern men are descended, not necessarily from men who wanted to have dozens of babies, but from men who wanted to achieve greatness and rise above other men. The men who lacked the impulse to seek greatness did not pass on their genes very successfully. As a result, the passion to seek greatness flows in the blood of today’s men. Women reproduced regardless of whether they strove for greatness. The women who did not strive for greatness had just as many babies as those who did. If anything, striving for greatness has often demanded (and still demands) a dedication to work and career that is difficult to reconcile with having a large brood of children. Hence, that passion for greatness may not be as deeply ingrained in the psychology of today’s women. The motivational difference in terms of striving for greatness is the main point of this chapter. The final sections develop various implications of it. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1238))

- In the last chapter, we pondered the difference in creativity. Men and women seem to have equal creative abilities and creative potential, at least when they are tested. Yet somehow, throughout history and all over the world, men seem much more passionately driven to create than women are. My best guess is that this reflects the result of the most underappreciated fact. Something deep inside a man, the product of centuries of evolution, nudges him along to try to create something new and different—and not only to create it, but to use that creation to make his mark in the broader society, to set him apart from and possibly above other men. After all, he is mainly descended from the men who did succeed in rising above others. The men who, like women, may have had creative ability but did not feel any deep passionate urge to make something different were less likely to pass on their genes.… ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1260))

- So ambition is likely to be more pronounced in men than in women. Women didn’t need ambition in order to reproduce. Men did. Or at least, all else being equal, men with ambition left behind more children than men who lacked ambition. More of today’s men are descended from the forefathers with ambition. The sex drive is another likely consequence of the most underappreciated fact. Nature built men to live ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1276))

- with the reality that they very well might not reproduce at all. Hence, it became crucial to capitalize on every opportunity. A young man who refused an offer of intercourse on a chance meeting with a comely lass in the woods might have passed up his only chance to have a child. Those concerns don’t apply to women. Mostly, women throughout our history could expect to have many more opportunities for sex than they needed to produce babies. (This is still true today, for those who may not have noticed.) For a woman, the game is about finding the best quality mate, someone with good genetic quality and who will stick around to support her and the children. She doesn’t need to be biologically wired to leap at every opportunity for sex. He does. Or at least, having that sexual eagerness would likely pay off in terms of more offspring. It might help him beat the odds and avoid extinction. Or it might give him an additional child or two on top of his legitimate heirs. Either way, being easily aroused would be a biologically rewarded strategy for men much more than for women. Why Men Go to Extremes The most underappreciated fact may have something to say about the pattern discussed in the opening chapters, namely that men go to extremes more than women. Nature plays the dice more with men than women. Men are nature’s playthings, nature’s guinea pigs. This argument is speculative. I have discussed this with various experts and mostly they think it is likely somewhat true, though it is far from a proven fact (and genuine experts tend to be quite cautious about making statements beyond what is definitively known). Here’s one reason men may be more likely to be genetically extreme than women. Think of a mutation, that is, a novel and unusual combination of genes, as an experiment: trying out a new trait to see how it fares. That’s what drives evolution. Inevitably, most of these experiments are failures. Unlike human experiments, which are carefully planned and thought out, nature’s experiments are designed at random, just producing a new genetic combination to see what happens. Evolution is very much about hit-or-miss trial and error, and there are many more errors than successes, more misses than hits. The optimal vehicle for a genetic experiment would have two characteristics. If the experiment is a failure, it should be quickly eliminated from the gene pool, so that the bad mutation doesn’t contaminate the species for many future generations. On the other side, if the experiment is a success, ideally it should spread quickly through the gene pool. ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1279))

- Put more bluntly, if the mutant is a loser, it should have no babies, and if it is a winner, it should have lots of babies, who in turn should have lots more babies. I say “should” in terms of what will yield the best results for the species and gene pool. (There is no moral “should” here.) Males are much better suited for this role of nature’s guinea pig than females. Remember, a woman can give birth only about once a year, whereas a man can father many different children in the same year. Meanwhile, many males have no offspring, while most females do have at least one child and usually more than that. Consider the wild horses again. The dominant male that summer has sex with all the females. The females have one foal each. He has a whole crop of them. The other males in the herd have none, or almost none. A few years in the future, when that summer’s crop of foals is grown to adulthood, that stallion’s sons compete for the top position, and the winning son gets to have sex with all the stallion’s daughters. His other sons are again left out. To make the point extra clear, suppose there were four mutants in that crop of newborn horses: two sons and two daughters. One of each is superior to all the others, maybe stronger or faster, more good-looking, and with better hearing. The other two mutants are biologically inferior specimens to all the others: weak, sickly, stupid, unattractive, partly deaf. The superior son, boosted by his advantage, has a better-than-average chance to win the competition to become the alpha male. As a result, he will have sex with all the females. Hence the next generation in that herd will all have his traits, including those that made him a superior specimen. The loser son will most likely not have sex at all. His mutation will die with him. In this way, the next crop of foals will be superior to the previous one. Due to nature’s experiments with the males, the genetic quality of the herd will have improved. Now consider the two mutant daughters. The superior daughter will have one foal that summer. But so will the inferior one. The genetic quality of the herd will not change much. Put in terms of nature trying out experiments, the experiment with the sons brought about significant progress in the species: the superior trait quickly spread through the group, while the inferior trait was flushed out of its gene pool within one… ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1298))

- One common way of understanding these patterns is to say that women are simply more social than men.

- I think men compete mainly against other men. That has been the basic fact and driving force in the historical progress of human culture. The actual data in the “Male warrior effect” work fit that view. It isn’t about men against women: It’s about men against men. In historical fact, men have always competed against other men. It is still happening. Often men competed for women, thus regarding women as the prize for victory, an attitude that probably goes back quite far through our evolutionary history, into other species where the alpha male (who got to the top by besting other males) was the only one that was allowed to have sex. But seeing women as the prize is quite different from seeing them as the enemy. I don’t think men see women as the enemy. If anything, I suspect most men like women more than they like each other. I do, as I already said. If this is true, the idea that men in general conspire together against women is dubious.

- The picture that emerged from this review was that women are concerned with connecting with other people—with forming and maintaining close interpersonal relationships. Men aren’t. Men seem content to break bonds, push people away, and strike out on their own. Cross and Madsen made a good case. In fact, their article was published in one of the most prestigious and competitive journals in all of psychology. As one of the experts who helped evaluate it, I voted for publication— even though I realized that someone might draw a different conclusion from all their evidence.

- There was something wrong all along with the conclusion that women are more social than men. In the first place, men need other people just as much as women need other people. No humans are designed by nature to go it alone. All over the world, people live in small social groups, usually embedded in larger social groups. And men have mostly formed and run those groups, especially the large ones. Hello? How does that square with the idea that men aren’t social? The “need to belong” is one of the most basic and influential human needs. That was the gist of a major review article the internationally acclaimed scholar Professor Mark Leary and I published in 1995. Doing the research for that article took several years and changed the way he and I thought about the world. Probably most psychologists had had some idea that people are driven to connect with others, but few had anticipated how much that need is behind seemingly every corner of the psyche and all manner of behavior. (I know neither Dr. Leary nor I had realized how powerful that was when we started the project.) In the dozen years after that article was published, it was listed in the bibliographies of more than a thousand other journal articles, plus many books. That is an indication that plenty of experts were influenced by it. Just to give you an idea: the need to belong drives both thinking and feeling. In fact, most increases in belongingness bring positive emotion, and most decreases bring negative emotion, which is a clue that the whole emotion system is geared to make you connect with others. That may not be the only function of emotions, but it is obviously a major one. Even physical health is strongly tied to belongingness. People who are alone in the world are more likely to die, and at an earlier age, from just about every known cause of death, as compared to people who are connected to others. When loners get sick, they are less likely to recover, and if they do, it takes them longer. This is true for everything from a cut on their finger to tuberculosis and heart attacks. And it isn’t just physical health: mental health shows the same pattern. People who are alone in the world (and even those who just feel more alone) suffer from a broad range of mental illnesses, more than people who are socially connected. The picture of the human being that emerges from that work is that humans are strongly, deeply, basically programmed to connect with others. Everything about the human psyche—its wants, its needs, its preferences, its capabilities—pushes it to belong. The need to belong is not limited to women. Men have it too. If belongingness were mainly a female goal, the data would have been much weaker overall. But all those facts apply to men. Men who are alone in the world get sicker and die younger than men who have strong social networks, just like women. The conclusion that “men don’t care about relationships” is at odds with a large mass of research findings. ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1420))

- Women are indeed more social if you define “social” only in terms of one-to-one close, intimate relationships. But if you look at bigger groups, then men are more social than women. Thus, the simple ideas that men are poorly designed humans, or that they somehow lack the need to belong, are silly. To understand the difference between men and women, it is necessary to recognize two different spheres of social interaction and two different ways of being social. Women are designed for the small, intimate sphere of close relationships in which people connect one to one. Men are better designed for the large sphere in which there are more connections to more people. These connections aren’t as close or as intense, by and large, as the intimate relationships at which women specialize. But they are important in other ways.

- Women don’t hit strangers. That’s where the big gender difference in aggression is to be found. Thus, the difference between male and female aggression has nothing to do with close relationships, contrary to what Cross and Madsen mistakenly thought. The difference lies in distant or stranger relationships. And so the difference in aggression is not based on women’s reluctance to risk a close relationship. It’s because of a difference in the kind of relationship that people care about. Women care about what intimate partners think, and so they will fight there. Men will too. Women don’t care as much about what strangers or distant acquaintances think, and so they won’t fight them. Men care, and men will fight them.

- The real reason most research finds men to be more helpful than women is that most research looks at interactions between strangers, usually unacquainted members of a large group (like fellow students at the same university). A typical lab experiment will stage-manage a fake emergency and see whether the research participant (who doesn’t know it’s staged) takes action to help the apparent victim. In these settings, men help more than women. But that’s helping a stranger. Meanwhile, though, if you look at helping within close relationships, the difference vanishes or reverses (just as with aggression). Who cares for the sick, comforts the upset, sacrifices one’s own career prospects in order to take care of someone else? Yes, some men do, but women probably do it more. Within close relationships, women are as helpful if not more helpful than men. Thus, the same pattern is found with both helping and aggression. People help and hurt more in the relationships they care about. Both men and women do these things in close, intimate relationships, but women do them a bit more. In the broader sphere of weaker social relationships among a larger group, men do these things more than women.

- What all this points to is that there are two very different ways of being social that correspond to two different types of relationships. The genders differ as to which one they specialize in. The one sphere involves close, intimate interactions. The main type of relationship is made up of two persons, who interact on a one-to-one basis. The technical term for this kind of interpersonal structure is the “dyad,” which is based on the Latin and Greek words for “two.” Another common term is the “pair bond.” The other sphere involves less intimacy but more people. Its main type of relationship is made up of larger groups, which can range from three to millions of people. Most commonly, think of groups ranging from half a dozen to a couple thousand people. Psychology, and surprisingly even my own field of social psychology, tends to focus mainly on the first kind. Research articles and books about interpersonal relationships are about intimate interactions, indeed mainly romantic relationships.

- If you take the usual, somewhat myopic focus of most psychologists, you emphasize the one-to-one pattern of intimate relationships: the pair bond.

- The crucial point is that these require tradeoffs. You might say that the ideal human being would be good at both intimate relationships and large group interactions. I agree! But perhaps that is not so easy for nature to arrange. Perhaps being good at one means being less good at the other. After all, when the kids have only one hour on the playground, they have to choose between spending the whole hour playing with the same one best-friend playmate or instead playing with lots of different kids. Once we get past the poisonous question of which gender is better, we can start to see the tradeoffs. And these may extend far beyond than how to pass an hour on the playground. They go deep into the human mind. The same traits that make someone better at close relationships may make one less well suited for large groups, and vice versa. Because both are important, nature preserved differences. In a nutshell, that’s a major reason why there are some average personality differences between men and women.

- But in large groups, emotional expression can make you vulnerable to rivals, who can spot and exploit your weaknesses. In economic transactions, like haggling over the price of a shirt or a used car, showing your feelings can weaken your bargaining position. And in many other ways, wearing your heart on your sleeve is not the most effective strategy for working your way up to the top. To function effectively in a large group, it is probably more useful to be somewhat reserved about showing your feelings, and likewise it may be prudent not to leap to the conclusions about others, who may likewise be playing close to the vest.

- Fairness is important in all human social relations, whether large or small. But there are two different kinds of fairness. Experts call these equity and equality. Equality means treating everyone the same (obviously). Equity means giving out rewards in proportion to what each person contributed. Under equity, the person who contributes more or better work gets a proportionately bigger share of the reward. Suppose you were to see an ad offering $400 to paint somebody’s garage, and you team up with three other people to do it. Everyone agrees to get started at 9 A.M. on Sunday and stay till it’s done. You’re there at 8:45 and you start setting up. When two of the others arrive at 9:30, you’re already painting. The fourth person gets there at 11, helps a little, takes frequent breaks to talk on the cell phone, disappears for an hour at lunch time, and then has to leave early. One of the others also leaves early, so you and the last other person finish the job. Should the money be divided equally ($100 each), or should you get a bigger share while the slacker gets a smaller one? Both outcomes can be considered fair, but one is fair based on equality, while the other is based on equity. Researchers have developed laboratory methods to test for these differences. Typically, a group of research participants will be set to work on some task. At the end, the experimenter will tell one participant that the group has earned a certain amount of money and it is up to that person to divide it up. You can keep it all for yourself or spread it around in any way you think best. What would you do? The typical finding is that men and women react differently. And no, very few people decide to keep all the money for themselves. The women tend to divide the money equally, giving an identical share to each person. The men divide it up equitably, which means that those who worked harder and produced more get a bigger share of the money. Which is better? Which is fairer? Neither is inherently the better or right way. Rather, the two systems reflect different ideas of fairness. You can’t do both at once. Equity relies on unequal rewards, which is the opposite of equality. Hence, there is a tradeoff: more of one means less of the other. Intimate relationships tend to work best with equality. There are so many forms of interaction that it is hard to keep track of who is doing more in what sphere. One earns more money, the other does more housework; one cleans the yard, the other makes dinner. Trying to decide whose contributions are worth more is divisive. If the other people in the garage-painting example were your brothers and sisters, probably you would lean toward an equal division of the money, though there might be some grumbling about the slacker. But in large groups, equity works better. If the people in the garage painting example were distant acquaintances, and if they insisted on dividing up the money with equal $100 shares for everybody, that would probably be… ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1590))

- And so people who are designed to function in large groups are likely to lean toward being competitive. Male competitiveness is much mocked and maligned. Sometimes it is frivolous, as when the boys on the beach try to skip the stone more times than each other. But it probably has a sound basis in biology. In our evolutionary past, the males who didn’t compete hard enough to make it to the top didn’t get to have sex and therefore didn’t pass on their genes, so their descendants are not among us today. Meanwhile, the ones who cared passionately about competing, even the ones who were unpleasantly competitive, were more likely than others to make it to the top, and their descendants are everywhere today. We inherited their genes—and the urge to make it to the top along with them. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1647))

- Communion refers to merging with others, caring about them, being closely linked to them, and other related desires and behaviors. The term agency comes from being agentic, as in being someone who acts. In personality terms, it denotes initiative, autonomy, and generally regarding oneself as responsible for getting things done. When researchers first began to survey the results of all the different trait and behavior patterns they found between men and women, many turned to this distinction as the best way of summing things up. Men were more agentic than women, while women were more communal than men. This distinction has stood the test of time reasonably well.

- Another familiar and well-documented difference concerns how people think about and describe themselves. The classic Ingmar Bergmann film Scenes from a Marriage dramatized this. Early in the film, the interviewer asks them to tell a bit about themselves. The man rattles off a list of his traits, focusing on what his special qualities are. The woman seems unsure of how to respond and simply reiterates her love for her husband and their children. Although men and women are in some ways becoming more similar to each other with the passing decades, there are still differences in what is emphasized in their self-concepts. Women are more likely to view themselves and describe themselves in terms of what are called relational traits, that is, traits that focus on being related to other people. Their identities are bound up in their social connections. Men, meanwhile, emphasize traits that make them stand out from others, and they think of themselves more than women do as separate units. In fact, this difference was cited by Cross and Madsen (the researchers we discussed earlier) as another sign that women were more social than men. In their view, men’s self-concepts focused on themselves as independent and unique and thus apart from others, whereas women’s self-concepts were based on connections to others.

- A mother doesn’t have to learn the trombone to win her baby’s love. Her child will love her regardless. (If anything, the baby might prefer that she not play the trombone!) Her husband will also love her without her being a trombone virtuoso. And so developing specialized skills and unique attributes is much less relevant for the kind of social life that women favor. But it is an important and valuable basis for connecting with others in the large social groups favored by men.

- Take an extreme case, perhaps, such as knowing that your child has performed some horrible crime. Would you report your own child to the police? It is conceivable that a man would be more likely than a woman to report it. If so, that would fit Gilligan’s theory: Men are swayed more by the abstract principles and rules, whereas women come down on the side of taking care of their own. At present, we do not know the answer. But let us assume that there was at least a shred of correctness in Gilligan’s theory. Again, it seems to fit the general thrust that men and women orient toward different kinds of social relations.

- The crucial point is that men and women have a basic motivational difference in the kinds of social interactions and relationships that they cultivate. The differences we observe between men and women in personality traits can, to some extent, be understood as tradeoffs. The different kinds of social relationships require different kinds of traits, and so there are some tradeoffs. The two ways of being social provide keys to understanding many of differences between men and women. They also provide a basis for understanding what men are good for. The next couple of chapters will ponder the value of these large networks of shallow relationships. What is more important to you, having a few close friends or having a large number of people who know you? Most people say the few close relationships are more important. As we have seen, the bias in favor of close relationships is widely shared, and there are some valid reasons for it. Close relationships have a strong impact on mental and physical health, among other things. Close relationships are more satisfying than casual acquaintances. But we shouldn’t necessarily regard men as second-class humans just because they specialize in the less favored type of relationships. There are benefits to the large networks of weak ties. Ultimately, such networks are what culture is built upon and what it emerges from. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1768))

- This book is about how culture exploits men. We are nearly ready to examine some of the specific ways culture finds men most useful. But that discussion won’t make sense unless it’s clear what culture is, and how it works. To say that culture exploits men (and that it exploits women too, which it certainly does) is to say that it uses people for its own goals. And that suggests it has goals. So we have to understand how a culture can have goals—and what those goals are. Before we can say anything like, “culture wants women to breed babies, and it wants men to be soldiers,” we have to agree on how it can “want” anything. Technically, a system can’t really “want” things. It’s just a system: an abstract set of relationships. But those abstract relationships are powerful engines for making life better.

- The “potato washing” story has become emblematic of animal culture. Monkeys on a Japanese island ate potatoes they dug from the ground. Unfortunately, these came out of the ground with dirt stuck to them. Having no choice, the monkeys ate the dirt too, which tasted bad and was hard on the teeth and bad for their digestion. Eating clean potatoes would have been a little better for survival, but they didn’t have that option, so they ate the dirty ones. One day researchers noticed that a female adult monkey made a discovery: She rinsed her potato off in the water, thereby getting the dirt off. This became her regular practice. Other monkeys in the tribe saw her and copied the potato-washing trick, which then spread throughout the tribe (except for the power elite, the oldest males). There was no sign of active teaching, but mimicry was enough, and the youngsters picked it up quickly. Years later, after that monkey and all her contemporaries had died, that tribe of monkeys was still washing its potatoes, whereas other groups of monkeys of the same species did not. Researchers call that culture: It was a learned behavior pattern based on information shared throughout the group and passed along to subsequent generations. Notice what their little bit of culture did for the monkeys. It made their lives better. Probably by eating less dirt they were a bit healthier, and so it may have improved their survival. At least, it made their food taste better, and for the most part tasting good is a sign that something is good for you. Setting aside ice cream and similar oddities of advanced (or, if you prefer, degenerate) culture, things taste good because they promote survival. There’s a reason potatoes taste good and dirt tastes bad: potatoes promote survival and dirt doesn’t. If there were ever monkeys that liked the taste of dirt better than the taste of potatoes and other nutritious food, they didn’t survive long enough to reproduce. If the monkeys had had more culture, it might have provided more benefits like this for them. Look what culture does for us. Food is there, without most of us having to grow it or kill it. Culture provides remarkably effective health care and superb quality shelter. (Even low-rent apartments are nicer than living in trees or caves.) With its laws and police, culture makes sure nobody is too mean to anybody else. That’s one key to culture. It’s a system to provide for material needs. It manages the large group of people. To appreciate what culture does, it helps to try to imagine what life would be like if culture were immediately canceled. Suppose, suddenly, by magic, our culture ceased to exist. All the people would be there, and you’d wake up in your same bed, but what would you do? There would be no job for you. In fact, there would be no laws telling you what to do and what not to do—as well as no laws protecting you from what others might do to you. Money would cease to exist. There would not even be language. Your supply… ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1821))

- Thus, a big part of what culture does is to provide these things. Now introduce one more wrinkle. Let’s say a tribe of apes has a nice life in their little corner of the jungle. There were some fruit trees to feed them, shaded places to rest, and a pretty waterfall to give fresh, tasty drinks. But then another group of apes moved into the area and wanted all of those same things. What happens? Do they share? Do they fight? Do they just annoy one another until one group leaves? And which one ends up the winner? With apes, probably the bigger group is going to be the winner. The relative number of bodies is also one crucial factor when human groups come into conflict, also. But with humans, there are additional factors. Monkeys don’t have much culture, so culture isn’t likely to make much difference in their conflicts over territory. But suppose one group of monkeys did have culture. Suppose they had a system for working together, sharing information, dividing up tasks, and making decisions collectively for the best of the group. And suppose the other group didn’t have anything like that. In that case, the tribe with culture probably would prevail over the other, even if the group sizes were similar. In human history, small groups with more advanced and powerful culture have sometimes prevailed over much larger groups. A couple of hundred Spanish soldiers overthrew the vast and mighty Inca empire. The soccer game example that began this chapter was intended to make a similar point. We should resist calling one culture better than another. But one culture can be more effective, especially at winning a conflict against a rival culture. One culture can be stronger than another. One culture can take over another and replace it. What Culture Is We are now ready to articulate what culture is. The difference can be seen by comparing the group of apes (or people) who have culture against the group who doesn’t. Culture is a system. It coordinates multiple parts and helps them work together. A group with culture is more organized than a group without culture. Culture is something a group of people has. You don’t have culture by yourself. A society (organized group of people) has culture. Culture is partly made out of information. There are at least two main types of this information. One is a set of shared beliefs and values. The other is shared knowledge of how to do things. Culture consists of both. The central importance of information is a vital reason that all human cultures have language. Anthropologists, who study different cultures, love to discover ways that make each culture different, special, unique. But they’ve never found a culture that doesn’t have language. It would be quite a feather in someone’s cap to discover a human culture without language, and the anthropologist who made such a discovery would probably win prizes and promotions. But don’t count on finding such a culture. Language is the best all-purpose tool ever discovered, and it… ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=1843))

- The monkey example leaves out one even bigger advantage of this: progressive accumulation. Each human generation can learn what its parents knew. Therefore it can start from there and add to it. Its creative efforts can take things even another step or two farther. In general, each new generation of animals starts over, facing the same problems and trying to solve them, just as its parents and great-great-grandparents did. Each new human generation, in contrast, can take up where its parents left off. Only one person has to invent a car, or a light bulb, or a computer, for example. Then that person’s invention is owned by the group. The knowledge resides there in the culture. The next generation doesn’t have to invent it again. The next generation can start with what that person did and maybe make it better—a safer car, a brighter light bulb, a more powerful computer.

- Exchange is another key to culture—another source of system gain. When I first began reading economists, I was baffled by their claim that trade increases wealth. How could this be? If Joe and Bob trade their shirts, there still aren’t any more shirts. Swapping doesn’t make more. But of course the economists are correct. Swapping shirts is a misleading example. A better example would be this: Suppose I have a garden full of tomato plants, and suddenly in August I find myself up to my ears in tomatoes. I eat all I can and freeze some for the winter, but I still have more than I can use. Meanwhile, Jeremy goes fishing and comes home with a truckload of fish, indeed more than he could use. If we don’t trade, I eat only tomatoes and the rest go to rot, while Jeremy eats only fish and lets the rest of them spoil. But if we swap some of our surplus, both of us eat both tomatoes and fish. Both of us are better off—effectively richer. Trade works even better in combination with the cultural benefit covered in the preceding section, namely specialization and division of labor. Different people specialize in making different things. If they put in the time and effort to learn to make them really well, the products can be better, but because they need many different things to survive, they have to trade them. The expert at hunting rabbits, the expert at making pots, and the expert at building roofs will all be best off if they trade their handiwork for each other’s.

- Culture exists in groups. And large groups are better than small groups for this. Hence culture will thrive most effectively in a large group. The preceding sections made several points about the huge advantages culture can offer. Accumulation of knowledge, division of labor, and trade are all vital means by which culture can make life better. But all of these advantages will operate more effectively in larger groups. Consider the accumulation of knowledge. The more people there are who solve problems and share them with others, the faster the group’s knowledge base will build up. The group’s stockpile of information will grow faster if fifty people share what they learn than if only three people share what they learn. Likewise, specialization and division of labor can be most effective in a larger group, because people can specialize more narrowly. And trade, too, will improve life to a greater degree if the trading network is larger. More people with more different products can create a more efficient market, which means that all the individuals have a better chance of trading what they have to give to get what they most need and want. That’s why globalization is coming, whether we like it or not. Some people will suffer from globalization, but more people will benefit. If you have something that a woman in China wants, and she has something you want, you’re both better off if you can make the deal than if you can’t. These mutual benefits will prove irresistible in the long run. ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2033))

- The value of larger groups of people for sharing information and so forth may seem obvious. It is, however, highly relevant to the issues of gender politics. As we have seen, men and women specialize in different kinds of social relationships. Women are better designed by nature to create and sustain close, intimate, caring, one-to-one relationships. Men are more designed to function in larger groups and systems. Therefore, culture is more likely to emerge from groups of men than from groups of women. Put another way, men are more likely than women to create the kind of groups that will produce culture and its gains. The differences are probably deeply rooted in the brain. Remember the point about the female brain being made for empathy and the male brain for systems?… ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2045))

- Let me reiterate that I think gender differences are more about motivation than ability. Women can think quite effectively in terms of systems, and men are very capable of empathizing with intimate partners. But when left to their own preferences, the two genders will tend to create different kinds of relationships. The women will prefer to create the close, intimate, supportive ones. The men will prefer to create the large groups, along with their systems. This will be highly relevant to the next several chapters. It offers a new basis for understanding gender inequality in culture (and hence the question with which the previous chapter ended, namely why are women victims of culture?). It also points the way to addressing the core questions about how culture exploits men. After all, culture originated as a system to get the most out of a group of men, so as to enable them to outperform and defeat other groups of men with other systems,… ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2052))

- What do cultures want? As I have said, the idea of cultures wanting anything is just a convenient figure of speech. It might be more precise to say, what do successful cultures (i.e., cultures that survive and flourish and can fend off hostile rivals) encourage their people to accomplish? But the shorthand is that cultures want things. Here’s a useful beginner list of what cultures want. It may not be exhaustive. But it is sufficient to understand the sorts of things that a culture needs in order to be successful—and on that basis to begin asking what men are good for. (Women too.) First, a culture needs to provide for people’s basic material needs. A culture is a system that belongs to a group of people, and those people have needs. They also have wants, which can increase. The line between needs and wants continues to blur. A recent survey asked people to characterize various products as either luxuries or necessities. You might think necessities would stop at food, water, and shelter, but a majority of Americans now regard cable television as a necessity, and at least one car. Computers did not exist until after the Second World War, and no individuals owned them until the 1980s. Yet now the majority of Americans consider them a necessity. Even cell phones are rated as necessities by almost half the population. In any case, providing for the basic needs of life is important, and this can be subsumed under the broader category of creating and increasing wealth. A culture in which people remain poor is not doing well and is in danger of being overrun by others. Rich cultures enable their people to live in peace and comfort—or, if they choose, to dominate their neighbors. The issue of dominating the neighbors brings up the second cultural need, namely military strength. In isolation, a culture might not need much in the way of military power. But given the relentless growth of world population, the good places to live soon attracted different groups. Conflict between groups, like conflict between persons, is an almost inevitable part of human life, as long as the different ones live in the same area and compete for some of the same resources. War is one way of resolving those conflicts. Hence a successful culture usually needs an effective military capability. A culture needs at least to be able to defend itself. This includes some soldiers and some weapons for them to use. It may include considerably more, such as spies, a weapons industry, research and development of new battlefield technology, logistics, computer networks, and planning. The next two needs, stability and progress, seem like contradictions (staying the same versus change), but this is misleading. Most people want both stability and progress. Stability refers to internal social relations that are peaceful, predictable, and harmonious. Human life is change but yearns for stability. People are happier and healthier if they know where they will sleep tonight and where their next… ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2092))

- Culture is gender-neutral in theory. In practice, women gravitate toward close one-to-one relationships, which offer only limited opportunities to benefit from the advantages of systems. Men are more oriented than women toward large groups. Hence culture will tend to grow from groups of men more than from groups of women.

- The upshot is that human culture emerged mostly from the men’s sphere. The pattern of relationships in the women’s sphere is profoundly important for health, welfare, and the continuation of the species across generations. For nurturance and social support, that style of relationship was and still is superior to most of what was found in the men’s sphere. But the men’s sphere was better suited for creating culture. The larger groups can accumulate more information and build up more knowledge (as compared to a two-person relationship). They offered much more scope for division of labor and specialization. Competition, sometimes friendly and sometimes cruel, allowed different ideas to be tried out against each other, so that the group as a whole could benefit from what the winner came up with. The losers in these competitions suffered various costs and punishments and deprivations. More important, the losers’ approaches or strategies were discarded, while the rest of the group copied the successful strategies of the winners. In this way, the male competition advanced the group. The women’s sphere did not create losers in the same way, which undoubtedly made it more agreeable to live in—but without losers, there were also no clear winners, and progress was slower. Incidentally, I suspect that that’s why many women today ultimately don’t “get” sports—that is, why most women don’t ever really care about sports the way men do and don’t really understand why the men are so interested in sports. Most women don’t resonate to the fundamental importance of proving who’s better at doing things, even, or especially, doing things that are pretty useless from a practical or biological standpoint, like pole vaulting or throwing a curve ball. That’s what gets men interested in sports, the proving of who’s better, because that’s what male social life is like. That’s what a large group is like. Women don’t socialize in large groups, so they aren’t attuned to that kind of competition, and often it strikes them as silly. I have always thought that the biggest difference between male and female interest in sports would be found not so much in watching games or enjoying them (though there are probably differences there) but rather in whether they check the scores. How often do you make the effort to find out the final score of a game you didn’t watch? I’ll bet that men do this much more than women. It matters to men, because the final score is one bit of proof about which side is superior. The male psyche is attuned to competition between groups, to one group pushing ahead of another and dominating it.

- One dramatic and revealing contrast concerns giving birth. What could be more feminine than giving birth? The birthing process has always been central to women’s lives, and for the thousands of years when men and women had separate social spheres, giving birth was quite definitely in the women’s sphere. Usually, men were completely excluded. They were not welcome and usually not even not permitted to be present. All the information and knowledge about the birthing process were kept to women alone. And then something curious happened. Gradually, after a long time, men were permitted access, and by using the male methods of pooling information and letting rival theories compete, men discovered ways to make the birth process safer. Male medicine has been able to change the birthing process so that many mothers and babies survive who would otherwise have died. It was mainly men, developing their theories about medicine and germs and painkillers and how the body works, who ultimately figured out ways to make childbirth safer, less painful, and less lethal for women and their babies. Indeed, these improvements came relatively fast, when contrasted with the thousands of years during which women held a monopoly on information about birthing. A similar point could be made about the health of young children. Again, taking care of offspring is almost always central to the women’s sphere and something they have done for centuries. One sad fact was that a great many young children died. Again, it was the progress in research by men that led to extraordinary reductions in the death rate of small children. In the 1700s people routinely expected some of their babies to die before the age of 5. Women were intellectually capable of solving this problem, but they did not, whereas progress in the men’s sphere eventually did. These days, at least in Western countries, a child’s death is a rare and tragic event, not an everyday occurrence as it once was. That’s how things went. The type of relationships that women prefer and create are vital to the human race and are, all things considered, more satisfying than the relationships men create. But remember my point about tradeoffs. Each advantage is likely compensated elsewhere. The superior intimacy and benefits of women’s relationships is based on things that make those relationships less suitable to the development of cultural progress. The men’s relationships—large groups working together and against each other, competing, striving, experimenting with innovations that might help them best their rivals—gradually drove the progress of culture.

- I like this example of birthing because it has nothing to do with the idea of men and women as enemies. Instead, it shows how men and women depended on each other and did things for each other. More important, it shows the value of the men’s networks even where one might least expect it. Women had owned all the information and knowledge about childbirth for thousands of years. Yet when the men were finally allowed into the picture, they were able to make significant additions and improvements. Again, this has nothing to do with differences in capability or intelligence or concern. It is simply a product of the different kinds of relationships that men and women create. When the women had their monopoly on information about childbirth, they passed it on via their one-to-one contacts and relationships: from mother to daughter, and sometimes from one midwife to her client or to another individual woman training to be a midwife. And as I said, this was sufficient to get the job done, and successfully in general. But the large male networks of shallow relationships, marked by competition between men with different theories and by other men paying attention to who won these competitions, were able to make progress in ways that intimate one-to-one relationships were not.

- Perhaps you are not persuaded by the birthing example. Let’s look for some kind of broader influence. How about checking the very things that drive the culture forward and make progress: innovations? Innovations require creativity. We considered creativity earlier, with the discussion of jazz musicians. Based on research using psychological tests of creativity, the conclusion was that women are just as creative as men. But based on the historical difference in creative output, I proposed that men are more interested than women to use their creative abilities to make their mark in the giant social structure and thereby to contribute to cultural progress.

- Investment banking is all about risk. Who goes into that field? According to the most underappreciated fact about gender, namely the difference in reproductive odds throughout evolutionary history, men are more willing than women to take risks. Hence that field should attract more men than women. It does. Recent evidence has confirmed over and over that more men than women go into investment banking. The difference is not one of discrimination—rather, it seems to depend on individual choices and on the male hormones that influence them. A recent study measured testosterone among male and female students at a prominent business school (the University of Chicago), and then it tracked their careers after they got their MBAs. It also measured, in the lab, their willingness to take a financial risk right away by asking them how much money they would choose as a sure thing rather than participate in a lottery that had a 50–50 chance of getting nothing or a big ($200) prize. The men were more willing than the women to take the risk on the lottery. For the women, even a very low sure thing was preferable to taking a chance. The men were more willing to take their chances on the lottery. Testosterone levels also predicted willingness to take a risk, with higher testosterone associated with more risk. Likewise, the willingness to choose a career in the risky field of finance (e.g., investment banking) was higher among men and among women who had high testosterone levels. Thus, men are more willing than women to take the kinds of chances on which financial progress depends. This does not mean that their decisions are correct.

- As a result, as the centuries went by, the men’s sphere became rich, powerful, and influential. The women’s sphere stayed mostly where it was. Can you name achievements by large groups of men? That is rather easy. Ships explored foreign lands. Banks financed new ventures. Armies conquered territories. Teams of scientists came up with discoveries and innovations. And how about achievements by large groups of women? This is difficult. One has to search hard through history to find instances of, say, a large group of women building or buying a ship and sailing off to explore foreign lands, or forming a conglomerate to make and sell goods for profit. Remember my point that gender differences are mostly in motivation, not ability? I think a group of a hundred women would have been just as capable as a group of a hundred men of building a ship and sailing off to explore. The difference is not one of ability. Women could have done it if they wanted to do so. But they did not want to do so. Women mostly do not do things in big groups. Indeed, the main thing women have done in large groups is to protest and complain about the men and the men’s activities. On this, women have been useful and successful in collective work. I refer here not only to the feminist movements from the suffragists onward, but also to various campaigns to protest men’s drunkenness, to reduce vice such as by getting men to stop using prostitutes, and the like. Women’s groups were also active in campaigning against slavery. In general, though, large groups of women were not an engine of cultural progress. They have functioned only as a reaction against the problems and excesses of the men’s activities, and that only intermittently. The topic is sensitive, and I don’t want to be misunderstood. The fact that throughout history women collectively achieved so little, measured in terms of cultural progress, could be misconstrued to argue that women are inferior in some way. I wish to be most emphatic that that is not what I am saying. Women are not inferior. Instead, that fact derives from the social organization of women’s lives, as I have said. Women were busy doing vital things for keeping the human race alive: creating and sustaining close, loving, intimate, nurturing relationships. These center on cultivating close, intimate, one-on-one relationships. It was just an unfortunate fact that progress in culture is best facilitated by larger social groups, of the sort that the men naturally favored in their sphere.

- The stereotype of female inferiority, in this view, resembles one of the classic findings in my own field of social psychology. It has several names such as correspondence bias and the fundamental attribution error. Essentially, it means interpreting someone’s behavior as stemming from inner traits when in fact it is caused by external circumstances. Women did not create intellectual achievements in their sphere, not because of any lack of intelligence, but because the social relationships in their sphere were not conducive to the competitive battle of ideas and accumulation of knowledge across generations. But people made the standard mistake of attributing the lack of intellectual achievement to a lack of intellectual ability.

- And What About Oppression? I have shown how we can understand the lower status of women as a result of how society and culture evolved. We don’t have to assume it was the result of men oppressing women. Does that mean there has been no oppression? The answer, I think, is that there probably has been some, but probably only a fraction of what has been accused and assumed. The amount by which men have oppressed women has been grossly overestimated, but it is not zero. ([Location 2467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2467))

- The more commonly cited evidence is ambiguous too. The fact that most world leaders and CEOs of large corporations are men does not prove that men oppressed women. Women start plenty of small businesses, indeed more than men do, but they do not build them up into large ones. They could. It is hard to imagine consumers refusing to buy an item simply because the CEO of the company that manufactured it was a woman. How many shoppers even know who made the products on the shelves? As for government leaders, well, men lose far more elections than women, so you could just as easily argue that the electorate is biased against men. The plain fact is that running for high political office is a risky career choice that has always attracted more men than women and probably always will. When both candidates are men, the winner is going to be a man, and this does not indicate bias in the electorate. Again, one can just as easily make contrary interpretations. In his book, The Myth of Male Power, Warren Farrell offered telling examples relevant to the story of oppression. The standard line goes that men are the masters and women are their servants or slaves. OK, says Farrell. When a master and slave are ready to go out for the evening, who holds the coat for whom, and who assists whom in putting it on? Who, master or servant, opens the door for whom and lets the other walk through it first? Who is served first at dinner, while the other waits? Who, master or slave, toils to make the money to support the other’s protected life inside the comfortable home? If danger arises, who, master or slave, must face the risk and possible sacrifice of life and limb to protect the other? Thus, over and over, the male and female roles can be analyzed in ways that indicate the man is equivalent to the slave, while the woman is equivalent to the master. No doubt one can generate some contrary examples. Nonetheless, painting a picture of human social life that feature man as master and woman as servant or slave is a highly selective, one-sided, biased interpretation.

- Regardless of whether you agree with feminists or not, one thing they have done extensively is criticize nearly every type institution in Western culture as biased against women. Corporations, universities, the mass media, the church, the police and legal system, and many more have been thus criticized. Can you think of any type of organization that has not been criticized, other than the few that have been set up expressly to articulate feminist protests and help women? As one reads these critiques, it is difficult to avoid the impression that many women, and especially women who claim to speak for all women, regard everything in the culture as built in ways that are unfriendly to women. Why do these women think the whole culture is built in such ways? We now are ready to answer that question. Women find culture is biased against them, in large or mostly small ways, because it was made by men for men. Things have changed considerably now. Most institutions now recognize the need to make changes to accommodate women. Changes have been made. Yet things never seem to be satisfactory, and the demand for more changes shows no sign of coming to an end. Perhaps it will never end: Women will never feel quite at home in large organizations. But part of the reason for this is that the female brain excels in a close, intimate, empathic interaction with another human being, more than by becoming a single cog or part in a giant system. Moreover, large organizations will continue to be built mostly by men. Large international ventures, large corporations, new global networks: These are mostly going to be initiated and built up by men, though women are perfectly competent to play any role in them. Let’s Be Fair to Both Let’s be fair to the women. They do need affirmative action, preferences, and other special programs. Culture is against them, as the great lesson of feminism taught. But let’s be fair to the men too. The reason culture is biased against women is not that men conspired to make culture as a way of oppressing women. It’s because women didn’t make culture or its big institutions. The men built these. Eventually the women showed up and asked, or demanded, to be allowed to participate. Let’s be fair to women. It’s not that men are noble in some way, altruistically making culture for the good of all. Men made culture to compete with each other, partly to win the hearts and spread the legs of women. They made it so their own group could live well, preferably better than rival groups of men. And once more let’s be fair to women. It isn’t because they aren’t capable of it. Women have performed superbly on the grand stages of culture. It’s just that women collectively were more devoted to building the crucial intimate spheres of love and support, individual by individual, and were never really to accept the brutal competition and human suffering that go into creating large social structures. Women are fully capable of performing well in high-powered jobs… ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2561))

- In this case, it also meant relatively poor men. Very few rich men would spend much time down in the coal mines. That case is not unusual. The culture values men’s lives quite differently, some far more than others. Rich men’s lives are valued more than poor men’s lives. Right now U.S. society is struggling with this in terms of race: If you kill a white person, your prison time tends to be longer than if you kill a black person. This violates the American sense of fair play, which means that all lives should be valued equally. It is deeply troubling that in any sense black lives are valued less than white lives (though much of that difference comes from the fact that people mainly kill members of their own race, and so if we are lenient toward black defendants, we end up being lenient to the killers of black people). Yet we don’t mind the fact that men’s lives are valued much less than women’s. America’s Declaration of Independence asserted that “all men are created equal”—and we still resonate with that phrase. Today it means that all men should be equal to all other men but less valuable than women. As usual, with the male extremity pattern, there will be more men than women at both extremes. Probably a few male lives get more elaborate protection than any woman’s. But plenty of men are valued far less. And most men know that in an emergency they would be expected to die willingly so that a woman could be saved. This is one case where the male and female averages aren’t equal. Men’s lives are valued much less than women’s. This lesser valuation is one key to understanding how culture uses men.

- When the news media report some disaster, they sometimes use the phrase “even women and children” if such are among the victims. What exactly does that mean? The phrase expresses the point that men’s lives are valued less. “Even women and children’ is short for, “it’s kind of bad that grown men get killed, but it is much worse for a woman or a child to be killed. It would have been better if only men had been killed.” Every time you read that phrase, it reminds you that your culture places less value on the life of a full-grown man than on anyone else’s life. A man who reads the newspapers will see that phrase probably once or twice a month, and each time it subtly tells him that his own life is worth less than the lives of other, more precious beings. Life in general may be cheap or dear, but men’s lives are cheaper than women’s. ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2637))

- But we all assume that young men are expendable. The question up for debate is whether a strong country with a nominal commitment to gender equality can expend some of its young women in the same way. The expendability of the young men is taken for granted, without question. And thus has it ever been. To be sure, some parameters change. The battles of Rome or, indeed, of prehistory had less deadly weapons, but then again the medical care was poorer also. And it was always uglier than what you see in the movies. In films, for example, soldiers who are shot by arrows typically fall down and die right away or else they manage to recover nicely, but in reality arrow wounds typically bring a slow, painful death. Either you bleed to death over the course of several hours, or, possibly worse, the wound becomes infected (it is almost impossible to get the arrowhead out of your body) and you die miserably from the infection. Your best option after being shot with an arrow was to have someone cut off the arm or leg that was hit. This operation would generally have been done without anesthesia, using some kind of metal blade chopping or sawing through your skin and muscle and the bone. The famous British hero Horatio Nelson was shot during a naval battle and had to have one of his arms cut off right away. He was an admiral and therefore had a bit more influence than most casualties. After the operation, which of course was performed with a metal saw and no painkiller whatsoever, he reflected that his suffering had been made slightly worse because the blade that had sawed through his living flesh had been very cold. He issued an order that henceforth the surgical tools should be warmed up a bit before they cut off the arms and legs of injured young men. In such small ways does a culture make progress, even as it uses its male population to best its rivals. ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2803))

- Why do cultures regard men as more expendable than women? In this line of questioning, it is helpful to keep value judgments to a minimum. Yes, culture has been hard on many men, and hard on many women too, and for various moral or other reasons one might wish things could be different, but that is not the point. We want to understand how and why culture exploits men in particular ways. A culture is not a moral agent but an unfeeling system that is fundamentally pragmatic. With issues such as capital punishment, it is fine for humans, as moral beings, to debate whether it is right and proper to put people to death under particular circumstances, but that is not the approach here. Instead, we would ask whether it is pragmatically useful: Will the culture be more successful if it executes certain members? In the Second World War, multiple cultures and systems clashed, and they needed to sacrifice the lives of many of their people in order to achieve their goals. All sorts of people were killed, but young men were sent to death more than any others. All the societies involved in the war lost many lives, though only some of the systems survived and prevailed. The victorious societies can remember their war dead with honor and gratitude, because the young men who died helped save the culture. The losers have a harder time making sense of it. Many mothers who painfully gave birth to baby boys and lovingly nurtured them into young manhood had to accept that their sons’ deaths in a losing cause accomplished nothing. From our perspective in our modern, supposedly enlightened culture, each new baby boy or girl is a precious life full of promising possibilities and endowed already with rights and entitlements. From the perspective of the culture as an abstract system, however, things may seem different. By the culture’s perspective, I do not mean what the ruling elite officially proclaims that it values and believes. Rather, I refer to what will enable the culture to succeed at continuing to exist, which often means making various forms of progress to outpace its rivals. In that view, each crop of babies is less a collection of precious individualities than a collective set of opportunities—and it would probably be more accurate to say two sets. To the system, the baby girls represent first and foremost the wombs that will produce the subsequent generation. Reproduction is the key to collective success in most cases of rivalry against other systems, and so the system needs the next generation to be bigger than the present one. That means it would prefer every girl to grow up and have babies. Each woman can raise only a few successful babies, probably around a dozen at the very maximum, more commonly about half that as an upper bound. The culture can’t afford to lose very many of its women, if it wants to sustain the population and ideally increase it. The baby boys are a different matter entirely. There is much less need to preserve every one. If war is… ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2817))

- Polygamy has been practiced in most cultures in the history of the world, and the current enforcement of monogamy can be seen as relatively unusual. There is a feminist protest against polygamy, as if polygamy puts women at a disadvantage. The objection seems purely symbolic, however. It is hard to see how women are worse off under polygamy than under monogamy, if all else is equal. Many women might prefer to be the second or third wife of a rich, successful man rather than being the only wife of an unskilled laborer or even of an assistant manager of a convenience store. She and her children might live much better being supported by the wealthy man. Even a woman who wants, for whatever personal reasons, to have a husband all to herself is better off under polygamy. Polygamy creates a shortage of wives and a surplus of potential husbands, and so the woman who wants a monogamous husband has far more men to choose from under polygamy. To illustrate, imagine a village with a hundred men and a hundred women. If ten of the men each marry nine wives, that leaves ninety single men and ten single women. Those are very nice odds for those women, even if they want monogamy. The main legal safeguard for women under polygamy would be to forbid the man to take new wives without the consent of his current ones. This could easily be required. And I suspect many women would prefer to let their husband bring in a new wife without his having to divorce them first, which is the practical upshot of the current system and enforced monogamy. After all, many men today do marry multiple wives—they just have to divorce each one before marrying the next one. Are we sure the previous wife is always better off by virtue of laws that require him to divorce her? Polygamy gives women more options and more choices. Why, then, has polygamy mostly been banned? The real losers under polygamy are the multitude of men. This isn’t immediately obvious, but that is because of the same kind of focusing mistake we saw in Chapter 1. The error that time was in thinking society was set up to benefit men, and it came from looking only at the top, at the lucky and successful men. Critics of polygamy make the same error. The minority of rich, successful men may do well and have multiple wives and large families. But that means that most men get none. Remember the village example I just gave, in which… ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2857))

- Explaining Male Extremity The expendability of males in nature (complementing and underlying the cultural version of male expendability) may well be linked to a pattern we saw in the early chapters, namely the tendency of males to be more extreme than females. Nature rolls the dice with men more than with women. It produces more male geniuses and more retarded men than women. It produces wider variation in intelligence, in height, in some aspects of personality, and other factors. You can think of extreme traits as experiments. Nature combines the genes in novel ways, experimenting randomly as to what might create a new, improved version of a human being. Most experiments will be failures, in that the random combination of genes (the mutation) will turn out to be less, rather than more, suited to success in that environment. Hence experimenting will mean more bad cases that, for reasons of biological selection and species survival, will have to suffer and die, preferably without reproducing. Consider the example of intelligence. For human intelligence to evolve, nature had to produce changing combinations of genes to try out different versions of the brain. Some, probably most, of these would not work and would in fact produce inferior brains. Ideally, if the species is to adapt and improve, these individuals should not pass on to future… ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2880))

- Meanwhile, most men do not reproduce. Only the most successful men do, and the retarded fellows are unlikely to make it into that elite group. So the experiment ends right away if it is done on the male. The unfortunate male’s genes are flushed out of the gene pool, whereas the unfortunate female’s genes may persist for many generations. Thus, already, nature gets a better result by experimenting on males than on females. The experiments that turn out badly are quickly erased from the gene pool. The other side of the coin is what happens with successful experiments, or in this example, baby geniuses. Here too the logic of male expendability promotes using men to experiment with. A genius baby boy is probably more likely than other boys born the same year to become a big success in his life. Because successful men can have multiple wives and many children, his genes will spread rapidly in the gene pool. In contrast, a baby female genius will still probably have only a few children, and so even though her genes are terrific, they can spread only slowly through the gene pool. (If the species is especially lucky, the female… ([Location 2892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2892))

- Expendability is a central but underappreciated aspect of the male role. It contributes more than we realize to misunderstandings between men and women. It may be difficult for women to appreciate this aspect of the male role. It undoubtedly contributed to some of the negative reactions women had when they moved into men’s roles and the men’s world. They were shocked to find themselves treated as expendable, not valued and respected automatically. Norah Vincent, the lesbian feminist who disguised herself to live as a man for months, acknowledged the problem. She had expected it would be great to be a man. Her plan was to sneak into the male world, enjoy the privileges of being a man, and then write an exposé to let women know what they were missing. Her book turned out very differently. Instead of male privilege, she found herself in a rough world where you have to justify your own presence and existence by your achievements. When you are in trouble, people don’t automatically come forward to lend a hand or take care of you. Sink or swim. Instead of glorying in her life as a male and writing a tell-all exposé, she cut short her life as a man and returned with happy relief to her life as a woman.

- First off, and most obviously, cultures benefit from having people whose lives can be sacrificed in battle. Obviously, people are not usually asked directly to die for their country or cause (though suicide missions are not unknown, and they have always been assigned more to men than women). People are asked to take the risk, however. Some thinkers imagine that the goal in war or battle is to kill all the enemy. That is wrong, as the philosopher Elaine Scarry explained in her thoughtful book, The Body in Pain. War stems from incompatible ideas. Two countries have different ideas about where the border should be drawn, or how they should be treated by each other, or which one has the best political or economic or religious system. Faced with disagreement, they are willing to put some of their people’s lives and limbs, and some of their wealth, in jeopardy so as to force the other to agree. The opponents likewise think they’d rather risk some of their people and their stuff in order to win the argument. During the battles, both sides lose people and other resources (blood and treasure, in the usual phrase) in service of the ideas they favor. Almost no battles or wars are pursued until one side is totally wiped out. Rather, at some point, one side decides that it would rather give up on some of its ideas rather than lose any more of its lives and wealth. It yields.

- War is thus a mixture of the material and the symbolic. The symbolic ideas of territorial or economic claims, religious beliefs, or whatever, are tied to the physical quantities of blood and money. Both sides lose blood and money until one side agrees to relinquish its symbolic claims. The culture is invested in certain ideas, such as those regarding its rights, its land, and its system. When these ideas are challenged by an enemy, the culture needs to fight battles and wars. These involve sacrificing blood and money. Most cultures in world history have relied on their men to furnish that blood and money. Thus, the culture maintains its ideas by virtue of the sacrifices of men, including those who risk their lives in battle. Again, the culture does not usually have to ask specific men to give their lives. Rather, it asks a large number of men to take a chance by going into combat, where some of them will die. Warfare is not an isolated case. The most persuasive and relevant figure, I think, is the one on dying on the job, which I have already mentioned in this book. In the United States, only slightly more men than women work, but thirteen men die in the line of work for every woman who does. The dangerous jobs go to men. Again, death is almost never an explicit part of the job description or a formal obligation, but the culture needs many people to take jobs that carry a slight risk of being killed. Over time, those accumulated risks take their toll, and a small percentage of the people in those jobs do end up dead. In America, as in nearly every other country, those people are mostly men. In both work and battle, then, the culture needs to request not a specific death per se, but a willingness to put one’s life on the line in a way that is likely to bring death to a few who take the chance but, it is hoped, not to most. The culture has a job to do, and it will take a certain number of deaths. The job may be a battle to be fought and preferably won. Or it could involve a… ([Location 2994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=2994))

- The economist Arthur Okun wrote an influential book entitled Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff. It is couched in economic jargon and full of formulas, but the key point can be translated into plain speech by saying that inequality has its benefits. In large groups in which everyone is equal, the system does not work as effectively and hence the total wealth and other benefits produced by the system are relatively small. In contrast, inequality can lead to greater productivity. In a sense, the Communist experience showed that pushing for equality essentially made everyone equally poor.

Basically it can set up systems with big winners and big losers. If you aren’t willing to have big losers, you can’t have big winners.

- He probably thought that in this age of gender equality and fair treatment for all and so forth, “Be a man” and “Be a woman” would be equal, parallel things to say. Yet they weren’t. She was a woman already, and she knew it, and he did too, and she did not have to prove it. But once his manhood was questioned, he would have to do more to prove it than simply say “I am a man!” in a loud voice. This brief exchange between two would-be apprentices reveals a basic asymmetry between the genders that is the focus of this chapter. Manhood must be earned. Every adult female human being is a woman, but not every adult male is a man. Most likely the recent softening and sensitizing of discourse to avoid offending anyone has muted this distinction, which means it was probably even starker in the past.

- The term “double standard” has become commonplace to refer to one perspective on sexual morality. The gist was that men and women are judged differently. In particular, the double standard is usually used to refer a belief that certain sexual behaviors are acceptable for men but immoral for women. The most common of these acts is premarital sex. Thus, in traditional societies that believe in a double standard, it is acceptable for men to engage in sex before they marry, but a virtuous woman is expected to remain a virgin until her wedding night. Evidence that the double standard exists has been surprisingly rare, and in recent decades researchers find no sign of it—if anything, it has become the norm to condemn men more severely than women for the same sexual misdeeds, such as adultery. The belief in the double standard owes much to a tricky illusion that has fooled even some experts. In polls during the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, for example, men would say that premarital sex was morally acceptable, whereas women would say it was immoral. Researchers would look at those numbers and say, “Aha! Double standard! It’s OK for men and not for women.” But this was a misinterpretation. The men said premarital sex was acceptable for both men and women. The women said it was immoral for both genders. Neither opinion actually indicated a double standard. Only a small minority of respondents (fewer than 10%) would say that premarital sex was acceptable for men and not women. Also, and contrary to the view that the double standard is a ploy by men to stifle and control female sexuality, all studies that did find any support for the double standard found that it was supported mainly by women. This is because women seek to control and restrain other women’s sexuality. We shall delve into the reasons for this in Chapter 10. The Imaginary Feminist’s claim that the double standard is something men use to oppress and control women is for the most part a giant mistake.

There was live music of all sorts, from organized bands playing in clubs to lone musicians on the street playing for tips. There were bars serving various drinks. There was a bit of street theatre. There were striptease places. There were magic shows. Ever the social scientist, I pondered what made the place function and what its patterns were.

- Sociologists long ago distinguished two ways of getting status: achieved and ascribed. Ascribed status is what somebody assigns you without your doing anything about it, such as by virtue of being born into a certain family. Achieved status is precisely what it sounds like: you earn the status by virtue of something that you do. ([Location 3132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=3132))

- Thus, again, manhood is socially defined, whereas womanhood is a biological fact. ([Location 3153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=3153))

- Sometimes manhood requires actually fighting. That brings us to dueling, which is worth a pause to consider. Dueling has many of the characteristics people deplore in the male ego: competition, wasteful violence, trying to outdo others, hypersensitivity to insults. Why did it survive so long, even as governments and concerned citizens sought to stamp it out? ([Location 3180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=3180))

- He said that the core achievement that defines manhood in a culture is that a man produces more than he consumes. ([Location 3216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WT26I0&location=3216))

- The fear of dependency is fear of being less than a man. I suspect its importance and implications for the psychology of men have yet to be fully explored. We have heard that men are sometimes reluctant to ask for help, to visit the physician, to ask a stranger for directions, or, indeed, to commit themselves to a relationship with a woman who will care for them. Why? The underlying motive may well be the sense that to depend on others is to lose one’s claim on manhood. Part of being a man is to be willing and able to take care of yourself.

- Self-sufficiency is not enough, however, according to Nock. A man must produce enough to support himself and then something extra. The extra that he produces is most often earmarked to support a woman and children, of course. That is why being a provider is so central to the way women judge men and men judge themselves. Men undoubtedly feel worse at being unable to provide for their children than they feel about being unable to provide for themselves, because in a pinch they would be willing to do without themselves (rather than be dependent on someone else), but they cannot ask their children to do without. To ask your children to do without is already to admit failure. When a woman loses her job, she has to cope with practical issues, such as loss of income. When a man loses his job, he has the same concerns but others too. Loss of a job means he does not produce more than he consumes. He is less than a man. No wonder that erectile dysfunction sometimes comes as a result of unemployment. Men without jobs feel themselves to be less than men, and their sex organs register the loss of manhood by ceasing to perform.

- In a nutshell, a culture needs its most talented individuals to put forth maximum effort to contribute what they can to the cultural system. The less talented men, not so much. They should just do their dull jobs, pay taxes, occasionally show up for battle if needed, produce quality off-spring, and generally stay out of trouble. But to prevail in tough competition with other cultures, a culture must milk its elite. Talent is there in either gender (though at the top levels, because of male variability, there will be somewhat more males). What motivates these men to put in the effort and sacrifices? Culture has to harness what the individual is born with. The innate motivational resources of the male are more useful for the culture than the female. Female motivational resources are more suited toward quality reproduction. Total population size is a basic help toward success in every cultural competition—including on the battlefield. But for innovation, which really enables a culture to move ahead of its rivals, most cultures have to depend on their elite men.

- Being a man means producing more than you consume. Yet that isn’t all it means. When someone says, “C’mon, be a man,” he or she isn’t usually saying, “Hey, produce more than you consume.” More often, perhaps, it means that there is a dirty or dangerous job that needs to be done. Such jobs aren’t considered suitable for women and children, as we saw with the British mining laws and plenty of others. Culture needs many of these jobs to be done, and it expects men to do them. Individual people usually also typically depend on men to do them. To be fair, there are dirty diapers and dirty dishes and plenty of other dirty things in the traditionally women’s sphere, so dirt is hardly limited to men. The strenuous and dangerous jobs are probably more unilaterally assigned to men. Mostly, men have recognized that dangerous jobs fall to them and, more important, that to be a man they have to accept them. Whether this will continue is not entirely clear. Today’s men are brought up on a rhetoric of equality, and at some point they may balk at letting women be exempted from certain unpleasant tasks.
