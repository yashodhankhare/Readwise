## Highlights
- The big lesson for me was that the terms “bullish” or “bearish” don’t mean anything. What is the person’s time horizon? What kind of move are they looking for? What price or events would tell them that they were wrong? ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=247))

- But you said he was a mentor. So what did you learn from him? Risk management. While he was buying into weakness, he wouldn’t just put on a full position and hold it. He would probe the market for a low. He would get out of any trade that had a loss at the end of the week and then try again the next time he thought the timing was right. He kept probing, probing, probing. That’s interesting because one of the things I’ve heard you say is that anytime you have a loss in a trade at the end of the week, you get out. I take it that watching Dan trade 40 years ago is where this idea comes from. So you’ve used this idea for virtually all of your trading life. Oh, I have. Dan used to say, “There are two parts to a trade: direction and timing. And, if you’re wrong about either one, you’re wrong on the trade.” Anything else that you learned from Dan? Yes, I saw that he took much smaller positions than he could. The lesson I learned from Dan was that if you could protect your capital, you would always have another shot. But you had to protect your pile of chips. And you had lost your pile of chips several times. I had. I had. It’s interesting that all of Dan’s advice deals with risk management, and none of it has anything to do with trade entry, which is what most people want to focus on. Were there any other significant mentors? ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=307))

- Dan was by far the most significant. The most crucial other advice I had was from a trader who was a chartist. He said, “Peter, you have to have an edge to make money, and a chart pattern does not give you an edge.” That was a sobering comment at the time, and it didn’t make complete sense to me then, but it did about five years later. I guess what he was saying is that anyone else can see the same chart patterns. Yes, and also chart patterns are subject to failure. I know that one thing both you and I agree on is that when a chart pattern fails, that is a more reliable signal than the chart pattern itself. [I not only agree, but I titled the chapter in my book on futures market analysis discussing this exact concept, “The Most Important Rule in Chart Analysis.”3] Also, chart patterns morph. You think you have a handle on the chart pattern, and then it changes into another pattern. A morphing chart is nothing more than a bunch of patterns that fail and don’t do what they’re supposed to do. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=321))

- What are they? Back then, I would have popcorn trades. Popcorn trades? You know how a kernel of corn pops, goes up to the top of the canister, and then falls all way back down to the bottom? A popcorn trade is what I call a trade that you have a profit on and then ride it all way back down to where you got in. I try to avoid popcorn trades now.

- So it wouldn’t bother you going long at $1.50 after getting stopped out twice at $1.20? No, that has never bothered me. I think that type of thinking is a trap that people fall into. I trade price change; I don’t trade price level. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=389))

- Has that been true over the years—that is, have your best trades tended to be the ones you least expected to work? I think that’s true. If anything, I think there may be an inverse correlation between how I feel about a trade and how it turns out. Why do you think that is? Because it is easy to believe in a trade that conforms to conventional wisdom. It used to bother me to be wrong on a trade. I would take it personally. Whereas now, I take pride in the fact that I can be wrong 10 times in a row. I understand that my edge comes from the fact that I have become so good at taking losses. So instead of being bothered by losing on a trade, you’re proud that you can take these small losses that prevent a large loss from accumulating. In that light, taking a loss on a trade is not a sign of a defect but rather a reflection of a personal strength that explains why you have been successful in the long run.

- I take it that your perspective on trading capital changed when you were managing other people’s money? It absolutely did. Once I found myself trading money for friends, all of a sudden, it was real money. It messed with my head. How long did you manage investor money? I started trading the first client account in January 2013, and by June 2014, I had returned all the investor money. How close was June 2014 to the bottom of your drawdown? It was the bottom of my drawdown. And I don’t believe that was coincidental. I think it was the bottom because I gave all the investor money back. That seems to imply that you wouldn’t have experienced the subsequent large rebound in your own account if you hadn’t given the money back. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=553))

- Did the 2013–14 drawdown experience change anything for you besides knowing you never wanted to manage outside money and cementing your conviction to sticking with your methodology? After the 2013–14 drawdown, I started looking at my equity in a different way. Before then, I looked at the total equity in my account, including open trades. That is the conventional way of looking at equity and, of course, the way the IRS looks at equity. But now, I don’t want to know my open trade equity. So I graph my equity based on closed trades only. What difference does that make to you psychologically? ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=600))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In reality, open trade profits aren’t mine. They don’t belong to me. So it doesn’t matter if I lose it. Therefore, it makes it easier for me to allow a market to come back against me somewhat. So even though your initial stop points are very close, once you are ahead, you give the market more latitude. Much more latitude. Also, once the profits of the trade equal 1% of my equity, I take half the position off. Then I can give the other half much more room. Will you still raise the stop on the remaining half of the position? I will, but much less aggressively. However, once I get to more than 70% of my target objective, I will jam my stop. That part of my trading methodology goes back to my days of popcorn trades. If I have an open profit of $1800 per contract on a trade with a target of $2000, why would I risk giving it all back to make the extra $200? So when the trade gets close to the target, I will raise the stop. When you get to within 30% of your target, how do you decide where to raise the stop to? Once it gets to that point, I will use a mechanical three-day stop rule. Exactly what is that rule? ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=605))

- Assuming a long position, the first day would be the high day of the move. The second day would be the day the market closed below the low of the high day. The third day would be the day the market closed below the low of the second day. I would get out on the close of the third day. I assume those three days would not have to be consecutive. That’s correct. The third day could be two weeks after the first day. I developed the three-day stop rule not because I thought it was the best rule—in fact, I’m sure it’s not—but rather because, as a discretionary trader, I hate indecision. I hate regret. I hate second-guessing. So I wanted to develop a rule that was automatic and would protect against my giving back most of my open profits. Your initial risk on the trade is about 1/2% of your equity. How far away is your target? A point equivalent to about 2% of my equity. And if it reaches that point, will you just take profits on the entire position? Usually, I will just take the profits. There may be occasional exceptions where I will use a very close stop instead, especially for short positions, because markets can collapse much more quickly than they rise.

- It seems like it would be so common for the low of the entry day price bar to be taken out without any consequence on the long-term chart picture. I totally get the concept that keeping your risk very low is an essential component of your success, but have you ever done the research to see whether your risk is actually too low? For example, might you be better off risking the low of a few bars rather than just a single one? ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=649))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Yes, I have done that research. I found that if I gave the market a little more breathing room in the early days of a trade, over time, I would make more profits. So, if my goal were to make the highest return, I would use a wider stop. However, my goal is not to maximize my return but rather to maximize my profit factor. [The profit factor is a return/risk measure that is defined as the sum of all winning trades divided by the sum of all losing trades.] Do you ever use a trailing stop? [A trailing stop is an order to exit the position whenever the market moves a fixed amount below the high of a price upmove (or above the low of a price downmove).] Never. When I hear people say something like, “I’m going to use a $500 trailing stop,” I think, “What sense does that make! You mean you want to be selling when you should be buying more?” That never made any sense to me. Nor does it make any sense to me that some people use their open profits on the trade to add more contracts. That, to me, is the most asinine trading idea I ever heard. If you do that, you can be right on the trade and still lose money. In my own trading, my positions only get smaller. My biggest position is the day I put a trade on. What is the weekend rule I’ve seen you refer to? ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=652))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The weekend rule goes back to Richard Donchian in the 1970s and basically says that if the market closes in new high or low ground on a Friday, then it is likely to extend that move on Monday and early Tuesday. The significance for me is that if a market breaks out on a Friday, then I have a completed pattern and the Donchian rule working in favor of the trade. Have you ever checked out the validity of the weekend rule? I have never statistically analyzed it, but I can tell you that many of my most profitable trades came from Friday breakouts, especially if it is a three-day weekend. I can also tell you that the trades that I stayed in despite showing a net loss as of the Friday close probably cost me more money than any other type of trade. I have learned that it is best to liquidate any trade that shows an open loss as of the Friday close. Why do you think that rule works? The Friday close is the most critical price of the week because it is the price at which people commit to accepting the risk of holding a position over the weekend. Do you now unfailingly adhere to the Friday rule? ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=663))

- I sometimes violate it, but when I do, the market usually slaps me in the face. The one thing I regret is not keeping data on different types of trading decisions. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=674))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I don’t sit and speculate with a loss. I learned a long time ago that if you speculate with a loss to get less of a loss, you end up with more of a loss. [Notwithstanding the massive decline on that day, the crude oil market moved significantly lower the next day and didn’t reach a low until about a month later.] The same trading discipline applies to an error. I have never speculated with an error. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=686))

- I know you do almost all your chart analysis and trading decisions for the coming week after the Friday close and up through the Sunday night opening. Do you make any new trading decisions during the week? By the end of the weekend, I have my list of markets to monitor for a trade. On rare occasions, I may add a market during the week, but I try to minimize such trades. If it’s not on my weekend list of markets to monitor for the week for a potential trade, then I don’t like to take it as a trade. This is another example of a category of trades that I wished I had kept data on. I bet if you counted up all the trades I ever did that were not on my weekend list of potential trades, they would be net losers. Do you trade intraday at all? For the first two or three days after I put on a trade, I am alert for an opportunity to tighten my stop, even intraday. But with that one exception, I don’t trade intraday. If I sit and watch the computer screen all day, I will sabotage myself. Inevitably, I will make the wrong decisions. I will get out of winning trades. I’ll second-guess an order that I placed when the markets weren’t open, and I made a decision based strictly on the charts rather than being mesmerized by blinking prices on the screen. For me, what works is a disciplined approach: Make a decision, write the order, place the order, and live with it. Your comments about how making decisions during market hours tends to mess up your trading reminds me of an interchange I had with Ed Seykota. I remarked, “I noticed there is no quote machine on your desk.” He replied, “Having a quote machine is like having a slot machine on your desk—you end up feeding it all day long.”7 ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=698))

- What I have found is that when you have a big move down, the first rally never holds. If there is ever a case where I want to sell into strength, it would be the first rally after a straight-line drop. Often the rally will last for only two days after the reversal day.

- I remember once retweeting one of your market observations and receiving a comment along the lines: “Why would you pay any attention to someone like Brandt who recommended going short the S&P 5,000 points lower?” What is your reaction to that type of comment? My philosophy is strong opinions, weakly held. The minute a trade reaches into my pocket, it becomes a weakly held position, and I’ll drop it like a hot potato. I can go from a strong opinion to being out of the market in one day. But in the Twitter world, all they remember is the strong opinion. It’s like whatever you say, it represents your opinion for the rest of your life. They remember the recommendation, but they forget that I was out a day or two later with a 50-basis point loss or, for that matter, a 50-basis point gain. In the Twitter world, there is a tendency to respond negatively if you were bullish and now switch to bearish or vice versa. Whereas, I think that the flexibility to change your mind is actually a strong attribute for a trader. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=736))

- So what, if anything, does still work? The only thing I have found that still works are patterns that tend to be shorter-term—less than a year and preferably less than 26 weeks—that have a horizontal boundary. Such patterns could include head-and-shoulder ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=758))

- and-shoulder formations, ascending and descending triangles, and rectangular consolidations. Is it that the patterns you are naming are not so much patterns that work, but instead are patterns that allow you to select entry points that have well-defined, reasonably close, meaningful stop-risk points? Yes, charts will give you the idea of the path of least resistance, but charts do not forecast. There is a danger when people start thinking of charts in terms of forecasting. Charts are wonderful in finding specific spots for asymmetric risk/reward trades. That’s it. I am focused on the probability of being able to get out of the trade at breakeven or better rather than on the probability of getting an anticipated price move. For example, I’m short gold now. I’m looking for the possibility of a $60 to $70 decline in gold. If someone were to ask me, “How confident are you about getting a $60 to $70 decline in gold?” that would be the wrong question. The right question would be, “How confident are you that you will be able to get out of the trade not much worse than breakeven?” You are using a trade signaling methodology that you acknowledge doesn’t have much of an edge. So what is your edge? ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=761))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It isn’t the charts that give me my edge; it’s risk management. I get an edge from discipline, patience, and order execution. A reader of my Factor weekly letter said, “Peter, you get your edge because you are willing to watch a market for weeks before entering and then be out by the end of the day because the market didn’t act right.” And I thought, “My God, someone here gets me.” All that charts do is give me a point at which I’m willing to take a bet. They give me a point at which I can say, “The market should trend from this exact price.” Another way to look at it is: Can I find a bar on the price chart where there is a pretty good chance that the low of that bar will not be taken out? So, it isn’t that you figured out where to enter trades so much as you figured out where you can place asymmetrical trades that have a near-50-50 chance of working. I think that’s a good description. All my profits come from 10%–15% of my trades; all the other trades are throwaways. The same pattern seems to hold consistently year in and year out. The problem, of course, is that I never know which trades are going to be in that 10%–15%. I know your trading falls entirely in the camp of technical analysis, but do you think there is any value in fundamental analysis, even if it’s not the right approach for you? Dan Markey, my mentor, had an interesting philosophy about fundamentals. He thought most fundamental news was nonsense. Dan had what he called the dominant fundamental factor theory, which postulated that, over an extended period, one to five years, there was one underlying fundamental factor that was the driver of the market. All the other news merely caused gyrations around the trend driven by the dominant fundamental factor, and, more often than not, conventional wisdom didn’t have a clue about what the relevant fundamental factor was. You could watch CNBC for a week, and… ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=771))

- If despite all that advice, someone said, “I got you, but I still want to give it a try,” what advice would you give them? Learn not to take a loss personally. The markets don’t care about who you are. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=802))

- What other advice would you give to someone seeking a trading career? You have to learn to wait for the right pitch. The hardest thing for me early on was figuring out the answer to the question: What is my pitch? What is the pitch that I’m willing to swing on? I think something that every trader has to come to terms with is answering that question. Can you define with high specificity what trade you’re willing to take a swing at? Only when a trader can answer that question is he or she ready to deal with other critical issues such as sizing, leverage, scaling, and trade management.

- Contrast the characteristics of winning traders and losing traders. I think there are things that the winners have in common. They respect risk. They limit their risk on a trade. They don’t automatically assume they will be right on a trade. If anything, they assume they will be wrong. They don’t get too excited about a winning trade or too bummed out about a losing trade. And the losers? They risk way too much. They don’t have a methodology. They chase markets. They have a fear of missing out. They can’t keep their emotions in check; they have wild swings between excitement and depression. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=836))

- It is ironic that what most people think is most important to becoming a successful trader—the methodology for entering trades—is actually one of the least important elements for Brandt. In fact, Brandt acknowledges that classical chart analysis has lost virtually its entire edge. What is critical is risk management. In fact, the methodology—chart analysis—is merely a tool to identify points in time that are amenable to the execution of Brandt’s risk management approach. Brandt places his stops to assure that he never takes a large loss on any trade, barring those rare circumstances where his stop is executed far below the intended level, as occurred in his First Gulf War trade—the only such trade in his career. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=843))

- Brandt’s trading approach is yet another example of a common trait I have observed among great traders: They have a methodology based on identifying asymmetric trade opportunities—trades where the perceived upside potential significantly exceeds the required risk.

- Brandt’s comments on the adverse impact of human emotions on trading reminded me of William Eckhardt’s observation in The New Market Wizards: “If you’re playing for emotional satisfaction, you’re bound to lose, because what feels good is often the wrong thing to do.”8 Indeed, the best trades may be the most counterintuitive or most difficult to take. One of Brandt’s best trades in 2019 was a short grain position, which was opposite to the direction he wanted to trade the grain markets.

- It is noteworthy that Brandt’s first losing year after becoming a full-time trader occurred immediately following his best trading year ever. I am reminded of Marty Schwartz’s comment in Market Wizards: “My biggest losses have always followed my biggest profits.”9 The worst drawdowns often follow periods when everything seems to be working perfectly. Why is there a tendency for the worst losses to follow the best performance? One possible explanation is that winning streaks lead to complacency, and complacency leads to sloppy trading. In the strongly winning periods, the trader is least likely to consider what might go wrong, especially worst-case scenarios. An additional explanation is that periods of excellent performance are also likely to be times of high exposure. The moral is: If your portfolio is sailing to new highs almost daily and virtually all your trades are working, watch out! These are the times to guard against complacency and to be extra vigilant.

- For Brandt, patience is an essential component of trade entry—“waiting for the right pitch,” as he expresses it. He avoids the temptation of taking every trade idea and instead waits for the compelling trade—one where the upside potential appears three to four times greater than the required risk with near-equal perceived probability. In my interview with Joel Greenblatt, the founder of Gotham Capital, he made a similar point. Referencing Warren Buffett’s comment, “There are no called strikes on Wall Street,” Greenblatt said, “You can watch as many pitches as you want and only swing when everything sets up your way.”10 ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=947))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is also virtually impossible to succeed at trading if you are dependent on trading profits to pay your living expenses. As Brandt notes, “the markets are not an annuity”—you can’t reasonably expect a steady income flow from trading. Brandt’s motto is: Strong opinions, weakly held. Have a strong reason for taking a trade, but once you are in a trade, be quick to exit if it doesn’t behave as expected. There is nothing wrong with being dead wrong on a market if you exit the trade with only a small loss. And don’t be concerned that changing your opinion will make you look foolish. Completely reversing your opinion on a market reflects flexibility, which is an attribute for a trader, not a weakness.

- How did you make money off of that event? Leeson had a massive short option position in the Nikkei stock index futures when he was found out. The Singapore government announced they were going to liquidate the entire position that day. Nikkei futures traded at a 15% to 20% discount to cash all day. I went long futures and short cash. The next day, cash and futures came back in line. I made almost 20% on that trade in one day. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1114))

- At one point, I was super bullish on the Hang Seng index and had a large position. I was scheduled to go on vacation to Africa with a friend of mine during the holiday season break. I was going to be away for about a month with no way to get communication about the markets. I didn’t want to get out of the Hang Seng position, but I had no way of following it. So, I told my broker to sell half my position if the Hang Seng went down to a specific price and to sell the remaining half if it got down to a specified lower price. I left and traveled around Africa. Three weeks later, I called my broker and found out that the Hang Seng was 15% higher. I made over $300,000 while traveling. Here I was going through all the trouble of getting charts faxed every day and trading every day, and then I make far more money because I am away in Africa and can’t see or do anything. That experience had a significant effect on me. It was like Jesse Livermore used to say, “You make your money in the sitting.” [Shapiro was referring to a quote in the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre, whose unnamed protagonist is widely assumed to be based on Jesse Livermore. The specific quote is: “After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars, I want to tell you this: it never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It was always my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!”] ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1124))

- He smiled at what he perceived my naïveté and said, “Well, there are times when everyone can make money. Take the European interest rate convergence trade right now. Everyone is putting it on, and as long as the euro comes into existence, everyone will make money.” His reasoning was straightforward: If the euro came into existence, which seemed a very high probability, European interest rates had to converge. It was a mathematical certainty. The implied trade was to buy the bonds of high-yielding countries, such as Italy, and sell the bonds of low-yielding countries, such as Germany. Because this convergence trade seemed like such a sure thing, all the smart guys on Wall Street, including Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and Salomon Brothers, put the trade on in as much size as they possibly could. Another trade that LTCM and other hedge funds had sizable positions in at the time was long Russian bonds because of their extremely high interest rates. In August 1998 Russia defaulted on its bonds. To help cover the margin calls on this trade gone very wrong, the holders of these positions had to sell other positions they held, which were primarily their European interest rate convergence trades. When they all tried to liquidate this trade at the same time, they found there were no buyers because anyone who wanted the position already had it on. This trade ended up blowing up LTCM and Salomon Brothers. The fascinating thing about this whole episode is that the convergence trade ultimately worked. The euro did come into existence, and European interest rates did converge. But because the participation in this trade was so extensive, most of the people who had the trade on lost money, and in some cases, the loss was significant enough to sink their firms.

- The answer to that question brings up another important lesson I learned that had a lasting effect on me. Now I see people make the same mistake all the time, and I recognize in them what I did then. At the time, the US stock market had been going straight up, and therefore I was going to be bearish, so I could be the hero. I kept shorting it and getting stopped out, over and over again, all the way up. I remember the market selling off after Greenspan made his “irrational exuberance” speech and thinking, “Look at how smart I am. Greenspan and I are the only ones who get it.” That same day, the S&P rallied back and finished the day higher. I remember looking at my girlfriend and saying, “I’m fucking dead.” So, you did recognize the importance of the market initially selling off on bearish news and then closing higher. I recognized it, but I had been shorting all along, and I fell into this psychological trap of thinking, “What, now I’m going to go long after being short all this time and losing all this money?” It was a fear of missing out on the short move when it finally happened. I don’t ever think like that anymore, but I see other people fall into the same trap all the time. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1161))

Don’t have an opinion. We used to have a saying in Hong Kong, “Should’ve been up, but it’s down, so short it; should’ve been down, but it’s up, so long it.” That trading philosophy became the basis of what I wanted to do: When the tape is telling you something, don’t fight it; go with it.

- Why did you leave after a year? I had a job offer from a hedge fund in New York. But before we discuss that, I want to go back to the CTA because I skipped over a pivotal part of the story. It was while I was running the CTA that I discovered the COT (Commitment of Traders) report. I was being a contrarian trying to short the stock market during the second half of 1999 because it had all the typical signs you see in a market bubble—the proverbial shoeshine-boy-giving-you-stock-tips euphoria. I knew it was a short, but the NASDAQ went up another 50% between August and January. I did a good job with risk management because, even though I was shorting stock futures, I didn’t lose any money since I was making money elsewhere, and I was cutting my losses quickly. So when the market was making new highs, I wasn’t staying short. I had at least learned those lessons. Later on, when I was at Gelber, I did catch the top and made money riding it down. Looking at the COT reports, I saw that the data never provided a sell signal until January 2000. I thought, “That is powerful data.” [The Commitment of Traders is a weekly report issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that shows the breakdown of futures positions held by speculators and commercials (industry participants). The report also provides more granular breakdowns. For example, for physical commodity futures, the Disaggregated COT Report shows four categories: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User, Swap Dealers, Managed Money, and Other Reportables. Since, by definition, there will always be an equal number of long and short positions in each futures contract, the commercial and speculator positions will move inversely to each other. The underlying premise of traders, such as Jason Shapiro, who use the report as a market indicator, is that commercials will tend to be right (because they are better informed) and, by implication, speculators will tend to be wrong. There is no consensus as to what particular readings (levels, change, or duration) constitute a bull or bear signal. Roughly speaking, though, a relatively high commercial long position (relative to historical levels and seasonal tendencies, if any) or, equivalently, a relatively large speculator short position, would be considered bullish, and the reverse configuration would be considered bearish.] So, you might think that people are long, but are they actually long? While the small guys may have been buying stocks and making money in late 1999, the large speculators knew it was a bubble and were short. The bull market didn’t end until they got squeezed out. Once they all got squeezed out, the market topped because there was no one left to buy. The COT report picked up that information. That is why I started to look very closely at the COT reports ever since that time. So, did your approach change to not looking for a market top until the COT data told you that the environment was ripe for a potential top—namely, that the… ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1188))

- Aren’t there times when the commercials are short for a very long time, and the market keeps going up, or the commercials are long for a very long time, and the market keeps going down? Sure, but I don’t just trade on the COT numbers. First of all, I need price action confirmation, and second, I have tight stops. For example, I got long heating oil about a month or two ago, which meant the commercials were very long, and the speculators were very short. I got stopped out. I put the position on again, and I got stopped out a second time. Then, all of a sudden, the positioning entirely changed—the commercials were no longer long—which meant that I could no longer buy that market. That is when the market really started to go down. So it is true that a couple of months ago, the COT suggested being long the market. But within a few weeks, it had turned neutral again, and that is when the price collapse really got going. In the COT reports, are you looking just at position levels, or do you also use the weekly change in positions? I just use the position levels. There are some markets, such as gold and crude oil, where the commercials are almost always short. I assume you must be looking at relative as opposed to absolute levels. Is it correct to say that in these types of markets, a buy area for the COT would be when commercials are short, but the short position is relatively small compared with the historical range? That’s correct. I look at relative levels. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1212))

When you sit in a place for a month with nothing to do but think, and the only things you eat are what’s given to you, it changes your attitude as to what is important. At that point in my life, what seemed important was professional success and getting a big house. Afterward, I never cared about any of that. It helped me calm down from the idea that money is everything and is so important—because it’s not. So what is important?

- Happiness—spending your day doing what you want to do. If I’m good at what I do, I make money, and that’s great, but it’s not the driver. The driver is the satisfaction I get from being good at something. People say, “It’s easy for you to say that now because you have money.” OK, that’s true, but there have been quite a few times when I was deadass broke. When I started managing money for Helmut, I had two kids, and we lived in a two-bedroom apartment—and my office was in one of the bedrooms! I couldn’t even afford a desk; I used one of those IKEA TV stands. My kids were little then. I still remember going to the store to buy a camcorder. It was $700, and I couldn’t afford to buy it. While there was some pressure in not having money, the truth is that I was as happy then as I am now. I couldn’t believe it: Helmut Weymar, who had hired some of the greatest traders who have ever lived, was giving me money, and I was trading for a living. Happiness is believing that the future will be better than the past. Even now, I just bought this house, and it’s great, and I love it, but it is not a mansion on the beach. I drive a 1998 Toyota 4Runner. It doesn’t mean anything to me; it’s just a piece of transportation. I don’t need to be driving around in a Land Rover. I think it all started with my being in that monastery in Burma. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1288))

- So, instead of using the COT numbers as the basis for a trade, you were using a human COT. It’s precisely the same thing. People ask me all the time, “What would you do if they stopped publishing the COT numbers?” I tell them that I can trade right off of CNBC. You can watch CNBC or Bloomberg all day, and 10 people will come on and say the exact same thing. Have you actually done that—place trades based on fading opinions on CNBC? I do it all the time. Most of the time, the COT will line up with the opinions on TV anyway. If everyone is saying you have to buy gold, it’s no coincidence that the COT is showing everyone is long gold. I don’t just make these trades on a whim, though. These guys may all be talking about something, but I still need the market to provide confirmation. If they are all super bearish, and the Dow goes down one thousand points and closes on the low, I’m not going to be a buyer. But if they are all super bearish, and some really negative news came out that day, but the market closes higher, I’m buying. I learned my lesson. You don’t fight the tape. Be patient, and the market will tell you when. The low of the reversal day will be my stop. I’m not going to argue with it. If I go long, and the market goes back to the low of that day, I’m out. I’m so disciplined with this stuff. It’s not just that I have a stop on every trade, which I do, but that I have a stop that is based on some meaningful market move. The news came out, the market gapped down, and then it closed up. OK, that low is going to be my stop forever. If that low is hit, I’m out. So the contrary opinion indicators you use only tell you what direction you should be looking for a trade in a given market, but to actually get a trade, you have to wait for a signal based on the market action. And if that market action subsequently gets contradicted, the premise for your trade is eliminated, and you’re out. Yes, that’s 100% correct. You need both the market positioning and the market action. I don’t know which is more important, but they are both extremely critical. That explains how you can be a contrarian in the market without having open-ended risk. If you pay attention to both the positioning and market action, you won’t get run over. I understand that if the market goes back to the low or high of the day you view as the reversal point, you will stop out of the position, but what gets you out if your stop is not hit?

When it goes to zero, I look to be a buyer, when it goes back to 50, I’m out. Is your oscillator based just on the COT reports, or does it include other inputs?

- Were you long on the rebound off the March low? Yes, at the lows, the COT data was in a bullish zone for the Dow futures, and we had an upside reversal on a day when all the news was negative. Funny enough, that previous evening, I was on a chat group started by a former colleague. One of the guys on the call, Adam Wang, is one of the greatest fades that I know. Adam is one of those Ph.D., smarter-than-everyone-else type of guys who works as a risk manager. He doesn’t trade any money because if he did, he would blow out. It was one of those days when the S&P was down sharply again to a new low for the move. Adam came on the group chat and said, “I haven’t seen any panic. This market has a lot further to go. There hasn’t been any capitulation yet.” It was the same thing everyone on TV was saying that week. This is a guy who hadn’t mentioned anything about the market going down before. Now that the market is down 30% in three weeks, he’s saying it’s not the bottom because there is no capitulation. As soon as Adam opened his mouth, I knew the market was going to run. The market went limit down to new lows that night. I put on a partial long position that night. I put on the full position the next day as the market rallied sharply off the lows, closing up for the day, despite a preponderance of bearish news.

- Was there a catalyst that got you back into trading? I visited an old friend and neighbor and talked to him about how I felt. He put me in touch with a contact he had at Bryson Securities, and they gave me an account to trade. Bryson’s attitude is, “We don’t care what you do; just make money.” If you lose money, you’re gone; if you make money, they love you. They never questioned my trades or what I did. Not trading for 18 months clears your mind. I used my system and overlaid my discretion and risk management on top of it. I was able to use everything that I knew from my 25 years of experience. It was great. Besides the times you blew out early in your trading career, are there any trades that stand out as being particularly painful? No. I don’t get stuck in bad trades; I just get stopped out. I may miss trades because I am stubborn. But I will never, ever violate my stop. So, I don’t get myself in those situations anymore. Obviously, a critical component of your risk management is placing a stop on every trade at a point that negates your hypothesis that the market has peaked or bottomed. Are there other elements in your risk management strategy? When investors talk to me about my risk management, they ask, “Do you use value at risk?” I tell them that I don’t because I think it is garbage. Value at risk is based on historical correlations, whether it is 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or longer. When you get markets like we’ve seen recently [the interview was conducted April 2020], correlations can break down in 48 hours. The value at risk will have nothing to do with the current risk. By the time value at risk catches up to reflecting an abrupt shift in correlations, it’s too late. ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1448))

- I am my own risk management. I look at the market all day. I’m paying attention to the market correlations, especially the correlations of the positions I am in. If I see that I am concentrated in positions that are all moving together, I will either reduce my position or put on a position that will be inversely correlated. That is why my volatility hasn’t gone up despite the explosion of market volatility during the past couple of months. I saw what was happening and what my positions were, and I reduced my positions. Did I make money? Yes, but what’s even better is that my volatility didn’t go up one iota. If you look at my daily returns, you wouldn’t have any idea that what had just happened in the markets happened. Was that because you reduced your positions or because you added uncorrelated positions? It was mostly due to my reducing positions. However, when correlations suddenly increase, as they did recently, I will be more inclined to add an inversely correlated position without necessarily having an official signal. As an example, after the February 2020 top, I took a short trade in the stock index, even though it wasn’t my typical type of signal, because being short the stock index, when I was long other markets, reduced my risk. The February top in the stock market was unusual. Typically, the market goes up, up, up, and speculators get more and more long. In this case, the speculator position wasn’t meaningfully long at the top. But then the market came down 5%, and everyone got long. And I saw the same thing on TV where everyone was saying you have to buy the dip. Then the COT report came out, and it showed everyone had bought the dip. It was the largest long speculator position in years. That was when I realized that the market was a massive short, and whatever the impact of the virus was, it was going to get a lot worse. I assume that was an atypical trade because even though you had an extreme COT reading, you couldn’t have had a reversal day signal here since the market had already declined 5% from the high. What was the trigger that got you short? Was it just the COT reading? The trigger was that I was long across the board. I have a system for trading stock indexes that I don’t use very often, but I will use it as a risk mitigator when needed. The idea is that if NASDAQ, a higher beta index, is lagging the Dow, a lower beta index, when the market is up—which is not the price action you would expect—and I’m long equity-correlated positions, then I will short NASDAQ. After the COT report came out, we had a one- or two-day bounce in which the NASDAQ lagged the Dow. That price action was enough to get me short since I was looking for an offset to my longs anyway. Do you sometimes put on trades that are not based on the COT numbers? Sometimes, I will put on a non-COT trade. The COT is not a perfect indicator. There has never been and will never be a perfect indicator. But, because I have lost so much money in the market and made… ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1463))

- Besides being a contrarian, what else has been critical to your success? I succeeded because I have failed so many times, and I had an open mind about failure and was able to learn from it. I failed because I sucked, not because the market was wrong or because someone screwed me, or any of the other excuses you hear. People fail, and they quit; they get scared. For some reason, I have a risk instinct. I hate failing, but I don’t mind taking the risk and then failing. I have a good friend who is a wonderful human being. His risk appetite is basically zero. He is a lawyer, making a good living, but he hates what he is doing. He’ll call me up complaining and say, “I know this guy is guilty, and he is a racist, and I have to defend him.” I tell him, “Why don’t you just quit, take your money, and do something else.” But he just can’t process that. And I can’t process not doing that. Why not take the risk? You’re going to die one day anyway. Is your approach as effective now as it was 20 years ago when you first started using it, or has it been affected by all the structural changes in the market since then? I don’t think it’s any different now than it ever was in history. Everyone is short; the market doesn’t go down on bad news; the market starts to go up. That is what a market bottom is. The market doesn’t bottom on good news; it bottoms on bad news. Also, there is a sound underlying reason why the COT has remained and should remain a useful indicator. My daughter just took a job with one of the physical commodity companies. She doesn’t know any of this stuff. She didn’t study finance; she majored in international relations. I was talking to her recently. “Let me ask you something, Dad,” she says. “I’m learning about hedging. If they [her company] own mines, then they know what the supply is, right?” I answer, “Yes.” “And, if they are talking to customers all the time, then they know what demand is, right?” I answer, “Yes.” “Wouldn’t they have inside information on their hedging then?” ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1517))

- If I have any message to the world—and it is the reason I agreed to do this interview—it is to convey the importance of participation. Everyone understands that the market is a discounting mechanism. What they don’t realize is that the discounting mechanism is not price; it’s participation. It’s not that the price has gone from 50 to 100, and therefore the bullish fundamentals are discounted. Instead, it’s everyone is long, and consequently, the bullish fundamentals are discounted. Amazon stock provides a great example of this principle. When it reached the $700–$800 level, everyone thought the price was ridiculous. There was lots of talk about Amazon being a bubble. It was clear, though, that the majority of people did not own it, or they wouldn’t be calling it a bubble. The stock is now trading above $2,300. The critical role of participation is a concept that applies well beyond trading. An example I like to use, which is outside the sphere of trading, is football betting. If you have the best team in the NFL playing the worst team in the NFL, everyone knows who is probably going to win. But that is not what you are betting on; you’re betting on the point spread. I don’t see how any type of analysis you could do could tell you whether the point spread is overvalued or undervalued. To me, the answer lies in participation. If everyone is betting on one side, then the point spread will have to move, and it will probably move too far. In fact, I have a football betting system that looks at 30 guys who make picks versus the spread. When 25 or more of them pick the same team, which happens only about six times a year, the other team will win 80% of the time. Now, is that because I have any ability to pick football spreads [he laughs]? No, it’s because if over 80% of the guys in my sample are choosing the same team, then everyone else must be doing the same thing too, and the point spread is probably too wide. The concept that a market’s discounting mechanism is based on speculator participation, not price, is the most important thing that I know.

- For timing his contrarian positions, Shapiro will look for market reversals that occur despite a preponderance of news in the opposite direction.

Before interviewing Shapiro, my answer to this question would have been that fundamentals are only bearish or bullish relative to price, and at some price, the news is fully discounted. Although this answer is still valid, Shapiro has a better explanation: participation. Markets bottom because speculators are already fully positioned short—a condition that will naturally occur in an environment of pervasive bearish news. A similar explanation would apply to market tops. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1580))

- Risk management is not merely essential for individual trades, it needs to be applied at the portfolio level as well. Specifically, traders need to be cognizant of those times when markets become highly correlated. In such situations, the risk for any given portfolio may be much greater than normal because of the higher probability of simultaneous adverse price moves in multiple positions. Shapiro manages the increased risk of higher correlation markets by reducing his overall position size and by seeking inversely correlated trades to add to the portfolio.

- Maybe, but one thing the return statistics don’t show is missed trades. I made my money mostly by trading events, and with the ongoing European debt crisis, there were many opportunities to make money trading events. Monetary policy was changing a lot in those days, forward guidance was introduced, and quantitative easing was restarted. There were so many events to trade, and I kept screwing up. I wasn’t well prepared for them. It was a vicious cycle of missing a trade, feeling like crap for missing the trade, and then watching everyone else making loads of money off of it. Did you feel like a failure at that point? Massively. That’s ironic because, objectively, you were doing very well in percent return terms, excluding the expenses being charged against your account. My theory is that for human beings, everything is relative. You are always comparing yourself with everyone else.

- and wanted to make it work. So it was tough being in a situation where I was almost out of money, and I felt that my parents were giving up on me. I didn’t think getting a part-time job was a good idea because I was spending all my energy on trading. I felt that if I got a part-time job, I would get even worse at trading. What did you do? I spoke to the bosses and told them straight up what the situation was. I said, “I am out of cash, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. Is there anything you can do to try to help me out?” And they did! It was amazing. They said, “We’ll pay you a salary. How much do you need?” How much did they give you? They gave me a salary that was enough to cover my monthly office expenses. I later found out that my bosses took Amrit to dinner to get his opinion on me. [Amrit Sall, who is interviewed in Chapter 4, had started at the same firm a few years earlier.] They said, “He looks like he’s struggling. We’re not really sure about him. What do you think?” And Amrit told them, “I think he’s going to make it.” It was Amrit’s backing that convinced them to give me a salary. Once I got that salary, I thought I had till Christmas to push my trading to more than cover the monthly costs. And, luckily, I did. [I interviewed Amrit the next day and asked him about this episode and why he believed Richard would succeed. He replied, “Richard is a hard worker. He has an amazing work ethic. If you are that committed to something and keep your focus on that one task, it’s only a matter of time before it starts working for you. He is that guy. He plugs away. He is proactive about dealing with anything that is holding him back.”] Why did they ask Amrit? Amrit was one of their most successful traders, and I think they valued his opinion. I didn’t really know Amrit at the time. I sat in another part of the office. I had barely spoken to him. Several years later, though, Amrit did become a mentor. He helped drive into me the importance of mindset in trading. Amrit helped me realize that I was getting in my own way. I was always a glass-half-empty type of guy, and I would continually beat myself up for making mistakes. Amrit kept saying to me, “Look, you can’t think that way. You are only going to trade well if you have a good mindset.” ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=1848))

- So, as of the end of October 2013, you still thought that your trading career could end that year. Yes, barring some miracle. What happened? In November 2013, the general market expectations were that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), would cut rates in December, but not as early as November. I was praying he would cut rates in November. Why, because that would be a surprise? Yes, because that would be a surprise, and I thought I could make good money on it. I know this sounds like a cliché, but I remember thinking, “If there is a God, please, this could be my last chance.” When Draghi announced a rate cut after the ECB’s monthly meeting, I immediately bought several hundred European short-term interest rate futures contracts. How were you able to take such a large position given your modest risk line? My bosses assigned position limits based on their confidence in the trader and the level they thought the trader could handle. They had seen that I was making money throughout the year and had raised my limit. The trade was simple. I aggressively bought short-term interest rate futures and exited the position when the rate cut was priced in. I made nearly £90,000 on that trade.

- The market will do that. Did that trade get you off of using technicals, or were you still trying to make technicals work? I was still trying to make technicals work, but, by that point, the majority of my focus was on getting better on the fundamentals. On paper, the method is really simple. You work out what will move the market. You find your trade, and you execute. What stops traders from performing well is themselves. Most of my problem was psychological. I would have a good day, become complacent, and then be unprepared for the next event, which turned out to be an excellent trading opportunity. It was hit and miss. I am much better now, but there are also far fewer opportunities now than back in 2013 and 2014. Back then, many things were still relatively new, like quantitative easing and forward guidance. There was more uncertainty about what the central banks were going to do and how they were going to do it. Whereas now, the markets have central banks so nailed down that there is not as much opportunity to make money on central bank actions as there once was. The markets now are good at pricing in events before they happen. I make money by pricing in a surprise, and with fewer surprises, there are fewer opportunities. You can still make money on these events, but you have to do it differently. You have to be smarter about how you do it.

- That all sounds very positive. What was the bad side of having Daljit as a mentor? I wouldn’t blame Daljit for it, but we were encouraged to be aggressive as a group. To build your account, you have to be aggressive. Daljit was always pushing me to do more size. I would take his advice too literally. I would take a 30-lot position in the Bund and sit there petrified because if I got it wrong, I would be cooked. But what I really should have been doing is trading five-lots and building up confidence over time. Did you then put on larger position size trades than you otherwise would have because of that influence? Actually, it worked exactly the opposite way. I ended up not trading a lot because I felt that when I did put on a trade, I had to put it on in large size. Then when the moment came to put on a trade, I wouldn’t do anything. Was that because you saw the choice as being between making a very large trade or doing nothing? Exactly. I would end up doing nothing because I was too afraid to lose. I am not blaming it on Daljit because he would tell me that I needed to trade more. He was trading a lot and learning a lot. One of my regrets is that I didn’t trade more. I was pushing my size to levels that were more than I could comfortably handle, which made me afraid to trade. I wasn’t trading, and by not trading, I wasn’t getting experience.

- I tested Donchian-type systems and moving average systems. [Richard Donchian was a pioneer in trend-following trading. The basic rule of the system he developed was to buy when a market closed at a new four-week high and to sell when it closed at a new four-week low. This type of system is called a breakout system. Basic moving average systems signal a buy when the market price or a short-term moving average rises above a longer-term moving average, and they signal a sell in the reverse case.] ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2005))

- That is precisely the problem with basic trend-following systems—everyone can do it. In the 1970s, or better yet the 1960s, when very few people were using trend-following systems, they did very well. I think of Ed Seykota, who back in the 1960s was running trend-following systems on an IBM 360 mainframe. He didn’t have much competition. But once you get to the stage where PCs are commonplace, and anyone can buy trend-following software, the efficacy of the approach starts breaking down. So, how are you using trend following to a positive effect? ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2023))

- Trend following by itself is insufficient. The critical elements are how you manage risk and how you take profits once you are in a trade. Initially, I used to go for the home run when using trend following. I would get in a trend and use a trailing stop to get out. However, I found that when there was a large upmove, and the market then came back down to my trailing stop, I hated giving back so much of my profits. You have to trade your personality. You have to feel at peace with how you’re trading. After you get out of a trade, whether it made or lost money, you have to forget about it like that [he snaps his fingers]. If you feel uncomfortable, you have to explore that feeling because there is a reason why you are uncomfortable, and you have to find out why. That feeling of discomfort is what led me to develop my methodology for exiting trend trades. ([Location 2027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2027))

- I have interviewed Peter Brandt for this book. What specifically did you learn from Peter? I learned that keeping losses as small as possible is critical to capital preservation. The most crucial thing in trading is mental capital. You need to be in the right headspace for the next trade. I find that when I go into a deep drawdown, my mindset is not right. I might start forcing trades to try to make money back. I might get gun-shy about taking the next trade. The way Peter Brandt manages risk is incredible. I am so happy I studied what he does. [Bargh showed me a thick binder he maintains of annotated copies of Peter Brandt’s trades.] When Brandt gets into a trade, he expects it to work straightaway if he is right. The best trades just go. If there is any sign that the market isn’t doing that, he tightens his stop for getting out. That approach fits the way I trade the fundamentals. When I put a trade on in size, I expect it to work immediately. If it is not working straightaway, I get the hell out of there fast.

- If you have a high-conviction trade and put it on in size, how long will you give it to work? The longer I am losing money in a trade, the more concerned I become, and the more aggressive I become in tightening my stop. Do you know how much risk you are taking on a trade when you put it on? I have a rough ballpark estimate. I know how much I will lose every time the market goes ten ticks against me. Do you have a predetermined number of ticks you will give a trade before you get out? It depends on the trade. The more confident I am, the more aggressive I will be with the risk I take, but, equally, the more aggressive I will be with my stop. I made 100% in one day on a Brexit trade. You can only make that type of return if you’re using substantial leverage on the trade. So I don’t want to see any pain in that type of trade. If I see pain, it is a massive red flag. So when you put on a large trade, you expect to be ahead instantaneously. I should be. Sometimes, I may be behind for a split second, but most of the time, if I’m behind on those trades, it’s not safe to stay.

- Do you then get out right away? I do. Is it a matter of minutes? Seconds. Sometimes if it’s not that large of a position, I may give it minutes. But if it’s a significant position, and it’s not working in 20 or 30 seconds, I’m out. People have difficulty in cutting losses because they are afraid of getting out of the trade and then seeing it go in their direction. It’s an ego thing. I was making the same mistake for years. I would get into a trade, put in my stop, and see the position trade at a loss for ages but without hitting my stop. I would wait for my stop to get hit, even though I knew that 90% of the time, the trade was not going to work. But I couldn’t bring myself to get out because I couldn’t bear to get out and then see the trade work. And, sometimes, when I did get out, the trade would then go to the target. When that happens, it teaches you to do the wrong thing, which is to hold on. The problem is that you only remember the times you got out, and the trade then went to the target; you don’t remember all the times when you got out, and it saved you money. Why do you think that is? ([Location 2059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2059))

- It’s human nature to always bias the negative and not the positive. Traders will fail because they will just stick with their stop, even if the trade is not working. The really bad traders won’t even have a stop, or they will pull their stop away from the market. That is what I call a CIC stop order—cancel if close. So you’re saying that it’s not enough to have a stop on every trade. That’s right. Traders will stick with a losing trade going sideways for five days, and just wait for the market to hit their stop. To me, the longer a trade is not working, the more likely it will lose. You mentioned you made 100% on a Brexit trade. Tell me the story behind that trade. All the traders in the office, including me, were expecting that the Brexit vote would not pass, but we all came in around midnight just on the off chance that it would. I assume that if the Brexit vote had failed, there would not have been any trade. Exactly. The results were announced region by region. As the night wore on, it became increasingly clear that Brexit was going to win. The market had not priced that in at all. So there was money to be made. The obvious trade was to sell the British pound. The problem, however, was that the pound was incredibly volatile, and I was afraid that if my timing was a bit off, I could wipe out half my account. That concern is quite understandable. I remember the British pound was flipping around wildly that night. It was not like one of those situations where the news comes out, and then the market moves in a single direction. That’s right. One region could have reported making it look like Brexit was going to happen, and then the next region could have reported and made it look like Brexit was not going to happen. I could have been caught with my pants down and lost a lot of money. So what did you do instead? I bought US Treasurys. I figured that the shock of Brexit passing would cause a market shift to risk-off trades, which would trigger a rally in US Treasurys. The difference was that if I were wrong, I would probably lose only a few ticks in a long T-bond position compared with a couple of hundred ticks in a short British pound position—a critical distinction given that I was putting on a highly leveraged position. How much did T-bonds rally? ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2070))

- Earlier, you talked about the importance of having the right mindset when trading. Can you expound on the mental side of trading? My goal as a trader is to always be in harmony with my process. So, I am using my feelings as an input to trading. I try to spot in real-time when I am trading poorly. In analyzing my past drawdowns, I found that I would start to trade poorly but then keep on trading because I was afraid of missing the next trade. I now have a straightforward method for dealing with this situation. If I feel like something is not right, I just leave work early, or I might take the next morning off. I will do whatever I can to put my mindset back in the right place. I want to be trading from a state of calm and inner peace; I don’t want any internal conflict. So, it’s like a circuit breaker for when you feel your trading is out of sync with the market. Yes, and I couldn’t do that before because I was too afraid of missing a trade. What was your worst trade ever? My worst trade was not my worst in terms of loss, but it was my worst because of the way I managed the trade. At the time, the eurozone PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) releases were moving the market a lot. One month, either the German or French—I don’t remember which—PMI hugely beat market expectations. I thought that the bond market would break sharply and stocks would rally sharply. I sold 200 Bunds and bought 200 Euro Stoxx. I was immediately offside by about £20,000. I said to myself, “I can’t take this loss,” and I sat with the trade. Luckily, the market bounced back, and I was able to get out with only a £3,000 or £4,000 loss.

- It’s one of those situations where the outcome wasn’t bad—in fact, it worked out much better than if you had immediately taken the loss—but it could have been a disaster if there hadn’t been that brief correction. You did the wrong thing, but the mistake worked in your favor. However, since you termed it your “worst trade,” you clearly recognize that even though you were lucky, it was the wrong decision. Yes, that trade shook me up because it made me realize I was capable of doing what I did. It scared me because I thought, “I could do this again.” You drew the right lesson out of that experience. Most people would probably have learned the exact wrong lesson: “Boy, that was smart of me waiting for the correction instead of panicking out.” Interestingly, what you label as your worst trade was only a small loss, and, ironically, the very thing that made it a bad trade made it a smaller loss than it would otherwise have been. I think the ability to differentiate between the action and the outcome is one of the reasons you’ve been successful as a trader.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To be a good trader, you have to have a high degree of self-awareness. You have to be able to see your flaws and strengths and deal effectively with both—leveraging your strengths and guarding against your weaknesses. It doesn’t matter if I miss a trade because there will always be another opportunity. Mental capital is the most critical aspect of trading. What matters most is how you respond when you make a mistake, miss a trade, or take a significant loss. If you respond poorly, you will just make more mistakes. If you take a trade that results in a loss, but you didn’t make a mistake, you have to be able to say, “I would take that trade again.” Opportunities are dispersed. You might have an opportunity today and then have to wait three months for the next opportunity. That reality is hard to accept because you want to make a steady income from trading, but it doesn’t work that way. In 2017, nearly all my profits came from two weeks in June and one day in December. That’s it. The rest of the year amounted to nothing. ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2192))

- Have a long-term focus and try to increase your capital gradually rather than all at once. You have to forgive yourself for making a mistake. For a long time, I would beat myself up anytime I made a mistake, which only made things worse. You have to accept that you’re human and will make mistakes. It took me four or five years to understand that. I don’t know why it took me so long. Staring at these screens all day long is like a casino inviting you to click. You have to guard against the temptation of taking impulsive trades. If a bad or missed trade destabilizes me, I have rules for bouncing back: Take some time off, exercise, go out in nature, have fun. I used to have a habit that whenever I lost money in the markets, I would spend less money. I would tell my girlfriend, “I don’t want to go out tonight because I lost money today.” That type of attitude only causes your mindset and body to get tight, which stops you from trading well because you don’t want to take any risk. A counterintuitive concept Amrit taught me is that I should spend more when I’m losing money. After I had a losing day, he would say, “Go out and treat yourself.” The idea is that you empower yourself by still going out and spending money. I found that advice very hard to accept and ignored it for a long time. Do you do that now? Now, I am at a stage where trading doesn’t… ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2202))

When you are out of sync with the market, the best advice may simply be to take a temporary break from trading and resume trading only when you feel ready to do so.

Sometimes, the market will provide great opportunities; other times, months will pass without a good trading opportunity. Bargh mentioned that in one very successful year, virtually all of his profits came from a two-week period and one other day.

- This experience illustrates an important trading lesson: The damage from a bad trade often extends well beyond the loss on the trade itself. By shaking up a trader’s confidence, such trades can lead to missing winning trades the trader would otherwise have taken. The resulting missed profits can often even exceed the loss on the original trade. Traders need to distinguish between trade outcomes and trade decisions. Sometimes, a good decision may have a poor outcome, and a poor decision may have a beneficial outcome. The trade Bargh labels as his “worst trade” was one in which he couldn’t bring himself to take a large loss and just held on to the position. The trade temporarily recovered, and Bargh liquidated it. Soon after, the market moved violently against his original position. By hesitating instead of acting to cut his loss quickly, Bargh turned a large loss into a smaller loss. Although the outcome of this decision was favorable, Bargh recognized that he was just lucky and that if a short-lived recovery hadn’t occurred, his original large loss could have turned into a disastrous one. Bargh realized he had made an immense trading mistake, even though that mistake turned out to be beneficial. Many traders erroneously evaluate their trading based solely on outcomes, whereas meaningful evaluation should be based on whether trading decisions were consistent with their methodology and risk control rules. Winning trades (or smaller losing trades, as was the case in this example) can be bad trades if they violate trading and risk control rules that have been responsible for a trader’s longer-term success. Similarly, losing trades can be good trades if the trader followed a process that has demonstrated efficacy in generating profits with acceptable risk.

- Sall has a unique trading style—one that I have not come across among any of the traders I interviewed in previous Market Wizards books. Although in this book there is another trader with a similar trading style (Richard Bargh), a resemblance that is related to Sall being a mentor to Bargh in his early trading career. Sall focuses on trading market-moving events, seeking to capture large gains over short time intervals—typically only minutes—by identifying events that signal a high probability of accelerated price swings in the anticipated direction. He implements this core strategy in large-sized positions because his preparation for these trades gives him high confidence about the short-term market direction implied by different event scenarios. Sall is meticulous in keeping comprehensive write-ups on every trade he has ever taken and the significant trades he has missed. He groups these trade logs by category, filling multiple binders with trade descriptions. These write-ups provide analogue models that aid Sall in determining whether a prospective trade is more likely to be a major opportunity or subpar. The knowledge base provided by his compilation of past trade summaries also allows Sall to create a trading plan for both the execution and management of an anticipated trade. After a trade is made, Sall will summarize what he did and what he got wrong and right. At the end of each month, Sall reviews the trade summaries for the prior month. Before any significant expected trade, he will review similar past trade write-ups as analogues for how the market might be expected to react. Once he has done all his research, Sall will do mental rehearsal in preparation for a trade, so that he can respond unhesitatingly whatever the details of an anticipated event prove to be. As he describes it, “I will spend some time visualizing and internalizing how the trade might play out. This mental rehearsal allows me to act instantaneously. It includes not only triggers for getting into the trade but also a plan for managing the trade. I will also envision different scenarios where the trade goes horribly wrong or where it goes very well and know how I will react in each case.” ([Location 2302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2302))

- I actually find trendline breakouts to be one of the most unreliable signals. What trips people up is that when you look at a chart, it seems like trendline breakouts work. But that perception is a consequence of knowing where to draw the trendline with the benefit of hindsight. What most people don’t realize is that, in real-time, there were often multiple other trendlines that experienced what proved to be false breakouts, which, effectively, redefined the trendline.

Moreover, I assume you had to be so informed on the fundamentals driving a given market that you could instantaneously assess the price implications of any news item. Yes. There are only a handful of factors driving any particular market at any given time. It is a matter of being aware of what is relevant to a market and what is priced in. If a key central banker came out and said something contrary to what was priced in, that would be a big trigger. I would react without hesitation and place an aggressive trade.

- Did the losses come primarily from taking trades that were deer instead of unicorns, or did they come from unicorn trades that didn’t work? It was definitely the former. It was a matter of being impatient and trying to force trades. I was trying to make money out of nothing. I remember one time during that drawdown period, in response to an ECB [European Central Bank] announcement, I put on my risk-limit positions in the Bund, Bobl, and Schatz [10-year, five-year, and two-year German interest rate contracts]. The risk manager came over, crouched down at the side of my desk, and said, “Amrit, what are you doing? What are you going to do with these positions?” I froze momentarily, and then I snapped out of it. That was the first time I realized how dangerous it could be to become lax in my trading. You had your maximum allowable position in three extremely correlated contracts. Effectively, you had a triple position. What was the catalyst for taking such an aggressive approach? It was a comment that I can’t even remember now, but I know that it was a marginal comment. I was in a significant drawdown, and I was hoping I could come back. So, you not only put on a marginal trade that was questionable, but you did it in triple size. What did you do after the risk manager came over to your desk and made that comment? I realized that I was in a position, hoping for it to work. The second I realized that I was hoping and not trading anymore, I immediately liquidated everything. That lesson has stuck with me to this day. I never want a position where I am hoping that it will work. I had to go through that experience to know the difference between a trade where I have full conviction and a trade where I am hoping.

- You had your maximum allowable position in three extremely correlated contracts. Effectively, you had a triple position. What was the catalyst for taking such an aggressive approach? It was a comment that I can’t even remember now, but I know that it was a marginal comment. I was in a significant drawdown, and I was hoping I could come back. So, you not only put on a marginal trade that was questionable, but you did it in triple size. What did you do after the risk manager came over to your desk and made that comment? I realized that I was in a position, hoping for it to work. The second I realized that I was hoping and not trading anymore, I immediately liquidated everything. That lesson has stuck with me to this day. I never want a position where I am hoping that it will work.

- The obvious lesson from that experience was beware of trades borne of hope rather than conviction. Were there any other lessons? I learned the importance of being patient. Market opportunities are always going to be there. With the benefit of hindsight and experience, I can now say that the big trades are pretty simple. You don’t have to go looking for them, but you do have to wait for them. Trading opportunities in the market ebb and flow. There will be periods in the markets where opportunities dry up, and there will be nothing to do. In those nothing periods, if you are looking for something to do, that is when you can create real damage to your account. That is what I was doing; I was still trying to do something when nothing was happening. Instead, I should have been waiting for opportunities. It’s the same idea expressed by Jim Rogers in one of your books when he said, “I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is… ([Location 2427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2427))

- I firmly believe that is true. To facilitate the outstanding trades, you need to be doing nothing in between. I always ask myself: Am I in a state of readiness? Am I fully prepared? Am I wasting my financial capital and mental capital on subpar trades instead of waiting patiently for the real trade opportunities? Ironically, implicit in your statement that the big trades are simple is the idea that it’s the not trading that’s difficult, whereas making good trades is easy. I completely agree. Any idiot can make something complicated. When I look back at the trades responsible for my best return months, they just scream out to me, This is a big trade opportunity. Had I taken only those trades and none of the others, my returns would probably have been double what they were. But trading doesn’t work that way. You have to learn to not be impulsive and to not do silly things in the interim periods—“the space between the notes,” as you term it. One of the mistakes I made in those early years was that when nothing was going on, I forced marginal trades, wasting mental and financial capital,… ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2437))

- Your trading history contains many days with exceptional gains. I counted 34 days in which you made a return above 15%, 15 days with returns above 25%, and five days with returns above 50%. But even with this history of days with huge gains, one day stands out: March 18, 2009, when your return exceeded an unbelievable 800%! How was that even possible? What is the story behind that trade? In November 2008, when the Fed first announced quantitative easing, it purchased mortgage-backed securities to stabilize the markets during the financial meltdown. I expected the Fed to eventually expand quantitative easing to include the purchase of longer-term US Treasurys. I thought that if and when such an announcement occurred, it would trigger an instantaneous, massive rally in T-bonds. March 18, 2009 was the day when the Fed announced an expansion in quantitative easing, which, for the first time, included the purchase of longer-term Treasurys. Did you take a large position immediately after the announcement was made? ([Location 2481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2481))

- Not as large as I would have liked. At the time, my permissible limit in T-note futures was 300 contracts. In anticipation of the event, I explained to the risk manager why I wanted an increase in my position limit in T-notes to 600 contracts. I was only requesting the increase in my risk limit for T-notes for this one anticipated trade, and I even offered to reduce or give up my position limits in other markets as an offset to this higher requested risk level. The risk manager, however, refused to increase my risk limit because I was still a relatively new trader and in a drawdown at the time. Because of this limitation, I also took a limit position in the Bund as a proxy for what I really wanted to do: double the T-note position. While not as profitable as the T-note trade, the Bund trade contributed significantly to my outlier return that day. How big was the move in T-notes after the announcement? [Amrit pulls out the relevant chart and shows me the day of the announcement. The price bar for that day is four full points wide. I am struck by two observations: First, the rally occurred within an ongoing downtrend in the T-note market. Second, the high of the announcement day was within a few ticks of the rebound high and was followed by a large continued price slide.] Ironically, going long was a great trade for the day, but it would have been buying near the high for any longer-term trade. How long did you hold the trade? Minutes. I was very quick to get in because I was poised for that one trade. The order was prepared, and my finger was ready to click. My mind was totally focused. There was no obstruction between the newsfeed and me. There was no self-doubt or excitement to compromise my acting on the trade. I was in a state of flow. I was looking for one trade, and I didn’t care about anything else. When the market surged after the news, I intuitively knew that the price move was so quick and so big that I should immediately take profits. I ended up selling the position near the high. So, the high of the move was made only a few minutes after the announcement. Yes. How much did you make on that trade? I made over $1 million in two or three minutes of trading! This was the moment that opened my eyes to the opportunity trading offered to a young, hungry, and disciplined risk-taker.

- Do you remember your emotional state after the trade was completed? It’s embarrassing thinking back on it now, but I had a very ungrateful reaction. It was a mixed bag. Of course, it was nice having such a great day. However, almost instantly, I fell back into a negative mindset. Why? I didn’t feel like I made $1 million; I felt like I lost out on making $1 million. It was such an easy trade that I wish I had more, and I did try to get more. So, you were actually upset because you didn’t have double the position you wanted? Looking back at it now, I am filled with gratitude, but that was not how I felt then. That was another part of the journey. When you put on a huge position like the quantitative easing trade, do you use a stop? Back then, I didn’t necessarily, but I do now. Getting a stop in place is a hard-and-fast rule for me now. Do you enter the stop at the same time you place the order? No, because I don’t want the market whipping back and immediately taking out my stop. Once there has been enough price movement to avoid getting stopped out artificially, I will put my stop in. It is essential to have that protection on because once you have a position, there is always the possibility of news coming out adverse to your position, and you may not be able to get out quickly enough. Having a stop in eliminates that tail risk. When did you start using stops religiously? After I had my worst daily loss, a 24% hit. When was that, and what happened? The trade occurred in June 2013, and it was a comedy of errors. The ECB had been touting the possibility of negative interest rates for some time. It was my belief that if and when they went to negative interest rates, it would be very bearish for the euro. You felt that way even though the prospect for negative interest rates had been widely discussed and people were sort of expecting it? Yes, because it would still have been a market shock in my time frame. It would confirm the action, and once the ECB went to negative interest rate territory by any amount, it would raise the question of whether even more negative interest rates might be in the offing. It would open up Pandora’s box. I am always looking for a trigger. I am looking for a moment in time that allows me to place a leveraged position for what I consider to be a potential big intraday move. If the trigger looks like the start of a longer-term price move, I will try to hold part of the position. My approach doesn’t stop me from putting on a position on an event that may be somewhat priced in because it can still trigger a big move on the day of the event, which is all I need to place the trade. So what went wrong in this particular situation? Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, was giving a press conference, and I was expecting him to announce a move to negative interest rates. When he was asked whether the ECB was ready to move to negative interest rates, he began his answer by saying, “I told you we are technically ready…” At that… ([Location 2510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2510))

- I panicked. I said out loud, “My computer has gone off! My computer has gone off!” The risk manager walked over to my desk and calmly said, “I can see what your position is. Come over to my desk, and you can trade out of it.” I am used to getting in and out of trades quickly, and I would’ve been out of that trade instantaneously because as soon as I heard Draghi finish his sentence, I knew it was a bad trade. Even worse, I knew there was a lot of speculative money caught on the wrong side of the trade, and I would normally have gone long after I heard Draghi say, “but we won’t pre-commit.” My best trades come from being on the other side of the type of trade I was in—namely, trades in which short-term speculators have it wrong, and I can go against them. Are you implying that if your computer hadn’t gone down, you would have reversed your position? I would definitely have attempted to reverse my position very quickly. What happened after you went over to the risk manager’s desk to trade out of your position? I saw that the euro was being bought quite aggressively, and I had no stop in. That moment ingrained into me the rule that I have to get my stop in as soon as possible. [Sall hits the desk with each word when he says, “I have to get my stop in.”] If I had a stop on that trade, my loss would have been minimal. Also, now that my trading size is much larger, I will no longer take anticipatory trades. Did you get out right after you went to the risk manager’s desk, or did you wait and watch the position? I got out right away, but the market was moving so quickly that I had already taken an enormous hit. What caused your computer to power down? I believe it was some Windows issue. That has got to be the worst bad luck trading story I have ever heard. How did you feel after that loss? What could I do? I realized that I could either accept it and move on or let it affect me emotionally in ways that were not going to serve me well. I put it behind me as quickly as I could. I left the office, and later that day, I got together with some of my friends at the local bar. We had what I called a “celebration” because I wanted to shift my focus to the positive aspects of my situation rather than sulk over my loss. I was grateful to be in a position that offered so much potential for earnings. The fact that I could lose so much money, so quickly, only reinforced the opportunity I had. I felt I was in the right job, but that I just had an unlucky moment. ([Location 2544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2544))

- Your choice of the word “celebration” strikes a chord with the conversation I had with Richard yesterday [Richard Bargh, who was interviewed in Chapter 3]. He said that his natural tendency after a bad day was to stop spending money and that one of the things he learned from you was that he should instead go out and treat himself. Richard and I had those conversations. After a bad trading day, I have two options: I can sit there, dwell on it, and let it hold me back, or I can flip it on its head and take control of it. After a big hit, I try to minimize the impact on my emotional capital by returning to a calm and centered state as soon as I can. I do a postmortem on the trade, learn the lessons, and move on to the next opportunity. After processing a big loss or drawdown, I have often treated myself from a place of gratitude for all that I have achieved to date. Through this process, I avoid the trap of repeatedly replaying the same… ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2567))

- I think I realized it after doing it a couple of times. There was a guy in the office who used to say, “Whenever you have a good period trading, make sure you treat yourself, so you know why you are doing it.” But you were treating yourself after you had a bad period. That’s precisely the opposite. That’s true. For me, it’s all about shifting your mindset. You want to get your mind back to a calm, rational place rather than being in a negative and stressed state. You want your decisions being driven by your prefrontal cortex rather than your amygdala. If I realize I am having a tough time, I will ground myself and be grateful for the journey. Then I can go out and treat myself. The ocean provides a good analogy. The ocean surface is covered with waves and turbulence, but if you dive down, it is calm. We all have the ability in us to dive down into that calm region.

- Your response to negative trading periods is 180 degrees opposite to what the natural reaction of most traders would be. Most traders would sulk and feel horrible if they had a terrible trading day, like your huge loss because your computer went down at a critical moment. That’s what trading is; it’s going against standard human emotions. As a trader, you are continually going up against your own emotional limitations. That is why so few people succeed in trading. How long did it take you to get centered again after you took that 24% hit because of the computer glitch? Instantly. I made all the money back within seven days. Was there a big trade that helped you recover the loss? No, it was more the cumulative effect of taking multiple trades that fit my criteria. You mentioned the importance of shifting your mindset to a calm state.… ([Location 2587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2587))

- Underlying subconscious thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can drive our actions and adversely impact trading. I came from a working-class family where money wasn’t abundant the way it is for me now. In the early days, I felt I often self-sabotaged and took subpar trades following record winning periods as a way to self regulate and “come back down to earth.” Keeping a log of these subpar trades allowed me to become aware of these automatic response patterns. [Sall pulls out a chart to illustrate the connection between emotions and losses. The emotional state is on the x-axis, with descriptions ranging from “calm” on the left end to “fear of missing out” on the right end. The magnitude of the loss on marginal trades, which Sall labels as “leakage” to indicate the losses were avoidable, is on the y-axis. The graph shows a clear pattern of the magnitude of losses moving from near flat in the calm region to increasingly larger levels as the emotional state becomes more excited.] This chart helped me realize the underlying cause of these… ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2599))

- region—that zone where things flow through you. The only way I could be successful in making millisecond decisions for large amounts of money is by accessing that calm state. I once read that the US Navy Seals use neurofeedback and biofeedback to help them access flow states on demand when in combat. I also read that the hardest part of a Seal’s job was knowing when not to shoot. These observations resonated with me. I thought that if I could learn to access a similar state of mind on demand, it might allow me to process a lot more information and get better at knowing when “not to shoot.” This goal led me on a journey of understanding the interconnection between the mind and body, and exploring meditation and flow states. Expound on how you get into a flow state and how it impacts your trading. Before a significant trade event, I go through breath work and meditation to center in on the present moment and transcend the chatter in my mind. Over time, I have learned how to access flow states within a few minutes. The ability to access flow is fundamental for success in trading and many other endeavors, such as professional sports. When I am deeply present, everything feels easy. In this “deep now” state, I’m reacting from a subconscious level that represents 95% of the mind’s potential versus 5% for the conscious mind. In this state, I’m creative, and I can process large amounts of information and react without hesitation. I’m open to new information and evolve my positions accordingly. Trading feels easy, and I’m not trying to force anything, I have no attachment to my position or the outcome. I cut losses without hesitation, and I run my winners without any impulse to snatch profits. In contrast, when I have difficulty transcending my mind before an event, everything I do will feel like a struggle. I will miss out on valuable bits of information. I will hesitate to put on correct positions because of self-doubt, and I will get out of winning trades way too soon. Through experience, I have learned that when my gut tells me that something is off, regardless of what my research indicates, my gut is usually right. Learning to trust my gut has been pivotal to my success; it tells me when a trade is a unicorn, and I should go all in, and when there may be unseen danger, and I should hold my fire.

- The longer-term trades are still triggered by the same type of events as my short-term trades, but a small percentage of those trades have long-term potential. Yes, but what is the characteristic of those trades that suggest they have long-term potential? Entirely unexpected events that have significant long-term implications for the economy can fuel long-term price moves. The unanticipated outcome of the Brexit vote and its aftermath provide a perfect example of a trade that had legs. How do you decide when to get out of a trade? I have an uncanny knack for picking half-decent places to liquidate. I’m working on translating my discretionary liquidation decisions into systematic rules, but I am not there yet. Also, if there is a parabolic price move on an intraday time frame on a position I hold, I will lock in the profit. I learned this rule the hard way when I have held onto such positions, thinking they would go much further, only to give back a chunk of the profits. Except for that one trade when your computer went down, you have been very effective in managing risk, especially considering the magnitude of your returns. I know an essential element of your risk management is getting out immediately if a trade doesn’t act as you expected. What are the other ingredients in your risk management? In terms of individual trades, I vary my risk between 1% and 5%, depending on my conviction level. As I mentioned earlier, I get stops in on my positions as soon as possible. I will also take partial profits on trades rather than holding the full position until exit. Taking partial profits allows me to lock in “free trades” that offer unlimited upside but zero downside after I’ve taken profit on part of the position. It’s like owning a free call option in a market I think should rally hard. At the portfolio level, when I hit a 6% drawdown, I may start scaling back my size and become much more selective on new trades I put on.

- In the past, I have tended to implement trading ideas in a single market. I now try to execute trade ideas in multiple correlated markets. For example, I will place simultaneous positions in the Bund, Euro Stoxx index, and the euro, or at least two out of three, rather than just one of these markets. The reason for this change is that, sometimes, if the trade is not working in one of these markets, it doesn’t mean there is something wrong with the trade hypothesis; it may just be that something is going on in that market that is keeping the trade from working. A good example occurred after an FOMC meeting that suggested the potential for lower rates. I bought T-notes and the S&P. The T-note position didn’t do anything initially; it was even down a bit. That didn’t mean the trade was not valid. If I was only in the T-note position and wasn’t also in the S&P, which rallied, I would have been more inclined to conclude that my trade hypothesis was wrong, which turned out not to be the case. What had happened was that there was an impending auction weighing down the interest rate markets, and once the auction was out of the way, T-notes never looked back. So I have learned not to concentrate my trade ideas in a single market. Over time, increased market automation and high-frequency-trading algorithms have made execution harder and eroded my edge on some very short time frame strategies. As a result, I focus primarily on higher conviction trades and trade less frequently during the month, but take on more risk per trade to reflect the conviction level. What are some trading misconceptions you have seen that cause people to fail? A lot of losing traders I have known thought they had to make money consistently. They had a paycheck mentality; they felt they had to make a certain amount every month. The reality is that you may go through long periods when you don’t make anything, or even have a drawdown, and then have a substantial gain. Entrepreneurs understand that. They will invest in a company for a long time, and the payoff comes in one hit after many years of… ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2669))

They will have a loss, and another loss, and another loss, and then, all of a sudden, they are in this really dark place in their heads where it is too late to escape because they have compounded all those negative thoughts. If they had killed the negative reinforcement process at the root by controlling their emotions after the first loss, they would’ve been in a much better position.

- I never give up. In the first seven months of this year [2019], I was in a drawdown. That hasn’t happened to me since my early years of trading. You need to have the resilience to last through the difficult periods. I am willing to outwork everyone else. In my early years, I used to get up at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. to get fully updated on any overnight news. I used to sometimes put in 15- to 18-hour days. To succeed as a trader, you need to have a fire in your belly; it’s the only way you’ll keep coming back after being kicked down repeatedly. I have that determination. I think the most significant single factor to any success I have had as a trader is my inner focus: self-reflection, self-awareness, journaling, meditation, and breathwork. In particular, my ability to get into a flow state is the essence of who I am and, when combined with in-depth research, is my edge. What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? It’s what you don’t do that counts. Patience is the key word. Successful trading is the art of doing nothing. It’s what you don’t do between the real trade opportunities that will determine your success over the long run. You can do so much damage to your mental capital between trades that when the big trade turns up, you are not ready for it. So, it’s not so much the losses you might take on suboptimal trades that is the problem, but rather the major trade opportunities you will be prone to miss because of the adverse impact of such marginal… ([Location 2721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2721))

- Trade Research and Planning—Successful trading is not a shoot-from-the-hip approach; instead, it is a matter of hard work. Sall prepares assiduously for every trade. He has compiled thousands of pages of notes, chronicling all his past trades. For each of these trades, he documented his trading plan, the details of the relevant event and market response, and what he got right and wrong. These trade notes, which are categorized, allow Sall to identify and study historical analogues to prospective trades. Using this personally compiled research library, Sall prepares a highly detailed write-up for each contemplated trade—a plan that encompasses a wide range of scenarios as to how the trade might evolve in real time. Sall also vigilantly watches the newswire all day for any unexpected events that might offer trade opportunities. Trade Execution—The types of trades that Sall terms “unicorns,” which account for the vast majority of his profits, require instantaneous discretionary decisions. There is no time for contemplation and analysis. Sall has to know what he will do for each possible circumstance as an event, such as a central bank statement, unfolds. Even taking a minute or two to think the trade over would typically result in missing the trade opportunity. To make sound trading decisions virtually reflexively when an event happens, Sall prepares by conducting in-depth research and planning, described in item 1. In addition, Sall engages in visualization and mental rehearsal as to how he will respond in a variety of circumstances, much as some professional athletes do before a big game or major competition. He also gets into a “deep now” state through meditation and breathwork. Emotional Calm—Sall considers maintaining the appropriate emotional state—calm, centered, focused—as absolutely essential to being a successful trader. He is scrupulous in avoiding a negative mindset or allowing a trade loss or trading mistake to impact, let alone derail, a subsequent trade opportunity.

- Sall believes that doing nothing between the genuine trade opportunities is far more challenging than executing the trades responsible for the bulk of his profits. Having the patience to avoid the temptation of taking suboptimal trades is essential for two reasons. First, these trades will tend to be net losers. Second, and even more importantly, the negative impact of these trades on a trader’s mental state and focus may result in missing the really big trade opportunities. The lesson is: Only take trades that fit your rules and avoid the marginal trades. ([Location 2770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2770))

However, another critical reason he creates and reviews this trade documentation is to learn from his past mistakes so he can avoid repeating them. Maintaining and periodically reviewing a written analysis of your trades that includes reasons for entry and exit, as well as what you did right and wrong, is a valuable exercise for all traders. It provides a useful tool for recognizing trading mistakes, which is the first step to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. Learning from mistakes is how you become a better trader.

- Is there anything about your experience playing tennis at a serious level that relates to your trading career? In tennis, you must take every shot, whereas, in trading, you don’t have to take every potential trade. You can wait for a trade where everything lines up in your favor. It would be like playing tennis and only having to take the shot when you were set up for a perfect smash. One thing I realized about trading is that I don’t have to trade if I am not in the right frame of mind or the opportunity cycle is not in line with the way I trade, and I quite like that.

- I felt uncomfortable with technical analysis because I didn’t understand why it should work, and, consequently, I didn’t have the confidence that it would continue to work in the future. Whereas with fundamentals, I had a much clearer understanding of why prices moved from one level to another. I also found fundamental analysis way more interesting. Actually, reading your first Market Wizards book was a formative influence in my early career. I don’t remember who said it, but the advice to trade a method in line with your personality had a significant impact on me. I don’t remember who said it either because that same message came up either explicitly or implicitly in multiple interviews. When I give talks about the lessons of the Market Wizards, the importance of trading an approach compatible with your personality is one of the first points I tend to stress. How did you start using fundamental analysis as a trading tool? It was mainly headline trading—typically, trading on the comments of central bankers or other officials. How did you trade those headlines? I had a view of what the market was expecting for any event based on reading various comments and news stories. Back then, I would trade headlines based on whether they were bullish or bearish relative to market expectations, even trades in which it didn’t seem to make any sense to expect a market response because the information was already out there. Can you give me an example? The point at which I really started building my account was during the eurozone debt crisis in 2011. That was the time when Greece began blowing up. Every day, you would see a headline referencing a comment by European officials that was either hawkish or dovish towards Greece. I would trade these comments for short-term moves in the euro. At one point, I noticed that an official could say something like, “We’re not going to help Greece,” and the euro would move 20 ticks. Then later in the day, Chancellor Merkel would come out and say the same thing, and the euro would move another 40 ticks. You would think that the information was already in the market, so there shouldn’t be any price reaction. But I would trade it because the market suggested that information was now more significant since Merkel said it. I didn’t care whether I fully understood the reasons behind it; all I cared about was the immediate market impact. I try to align myself more with making money than being intellectually correct. In practice, that means letting the market reaction to news guide me as to what is important. Before, you used the phrase, “back then,” implying that you no longer trade the fundamentals the same way. How has your approach changed? Actually, what I do now is quite the opposite. I will fade the initial reactions to headlines. It is no longer possible to trade for the initial move off the headline because the algos will make the trade before I can. [Dhaliwal is referring to algorithmic programs that are designed to… ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2934))

- Not entirely. The major shift was a transition to trades that were based on a broader macroeconomic analysis. Can you give me an example? This past July [2019], I went short the S&P in what was probably my largest trade ever. I felt the policymakers weren’t doing enough to alleviate the downside risks in the economy. Payroll growth and manufacturing were slowing. At the same time, EU economic data was terrible. Based on my historical analogue models, I felt that given the economic regime we were in, the equity market was susceptible to a drawdown. Where exactly did you go short? [Dhaliwal shows me the chart pointing to a narrow consolidation forming near the top of a broader range near all-time highs.] Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, the market subsequently broke back down towards the lower end of the range, but, at the time, a consolidation near all-time highs is a type of pattern that could easily have led to another upswing. What would have happened if the market started rallying into new highs? How much room would you have given the market? Not a lot because I was timing the market based on some of my short-term fundamental indicators. Also, I split the trade between outright shorts in the S&P and long S&P puts. I gave the puts more breathing room. When a market trades in a wide range on the same fundamentals, as the S&P did, how do you decide when to initiate the trade? I assume that your stop would have been considerably narrower than the market range. I wouldn’t sell the S&P in no man’s land. The entry would be more towards the top of the range. That is what I was grappling with. So, if you have a bearish view and the market is in a wide range, then when the market gets to the top of the range, where it is unclear whether it will fail or break out to new highs, you would be inclined to trade from the short side because your fundamental models suggest that a failure is more likely. Is that a fair description of how you might determine the timing of a trade based on fundamentals? Yes, with the proviso that if there is a significant development, it doesn’t matter where the market is within the range. I assume by “significant development,” you are referring to a headline event whose impact is likely to be long-lasting. But that raises the question: What if such an event’s implications are contrary to your fundamental expectations? I would go with the event if it were big enough. I want to make money more than I want to be right. Also, I am not looking for confirming signals; I am looking for disconfirming signals. All I care about is how I might be wrong. If there is a meaningful adverse event, it might mean my models are wrong. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=2973))

- Several weeks after our interview, the S&P 500 broke out to new highs and staged a large advance in the ensuing months. This price action prompted a follow-up Q&A via email. All the economic reasons you mentioned for being short the S&P during our interview would seemingly also have applied in Q4 when the market went straight up. I don’t understand why the same fundamentals wouldn’t have dictated a bearish stance in Q4 when such a trading position would have been dead wrong. What were the differences between when you put on the trade [late July 2019] and Q4 that would have kept you off the short side in Q4? My outlook for some key economic indicators for Q4 was indeed bearish.

- So is it fair to say that two things changed in your trading after that trade: You always have a stop in, and you take partial profits when possible? Exactly.

- I found you through Steve Goldstein [the founder of Alpha R Cubed, a London-based executive coaching firm, who has worked with many excellent traders]. You have done so extraordinarily well. What was your motivation in seeking a trading coach? Peter Brandt says, “Successful market speculation is an upstream swim against human nature,” and I liken coaching to a speedboat that helps me do that. I felt I needed an external check on my own trading, particularly when I was not trading my best or the opportunity set was not in line with my trading style, and Steve plays that role. At those times, I find it helpful to talk to Steve to prevent myself from going into a deeper drawdown. Additionally, working with Steve helped me clarify and solidify my trading rules. He also helped me realize that I was too focused on my weaknesses and that I needed to focus more on my strengths. If you focus on your strengths, you don’t leave any time for your weaknesses.

- How was the lunch? Amazing. Ray Dalio’s book, Principles, had a significant impact on me and not only changed the way I thought about trading but also about life. In what way? After reading Principles, I started questioning everything. I think what Dalio was saying in that book is that your perception of reality is not necessarily the way things are. To reach your goals, you need a strong understanding of the links between the actions you take and the outcomes they produce over time. You can then adjust your actions where needed to reach the desired outcomes. That message prompted me to start doing data analysis on my trades. What did you learn from that exercise? I reviewed the trading notes I kept, which represented my perceptions, and then I looked at the data of the outcomes for those trades, which represented the reality. One realization that came out of that review was that although I thought I was good at technical analysis, I discovered that I really wasn’t. Did that insight change your trading? It did. I started ditching technical analysis. How did the conversation proceed at lunch? Dalio said, “This is your time. Ask anything you want.” So what was the first thing you asked? I was quite nervous. It’s a bit of a blur looking back at it now. I told Dalio that I wanted to talk about my trading, markets, and his views on life. Did he give you any specific advice? He told me it was essential to go as far back as I could to test my views. Dalio is a master of history. He said that people get blindsided by something that has happened before because they overweight recent history ([Location 3069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3069))

- and their own experience and don’t go back far enough to backtest their views. He helped me understand that to get conviction, you have to look at history well beyond your own experience. So now, when you analyze markets, how far back do you go? As far as I can. Which means what? At the moment, about 100 years—but, ideally, I would like to go back well beyond that. Reading is part of my research. One book that I read recently is Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation by Edward Chancellor. That book talks about market bubbles going all the way back to tulipmania. Is that a good book? It’s fantastic. It’s a book that can help you develop the kind of broader historical perspective of markets and speculation that Dalio talks about. Were there any other insights that you got from your lunch with Dalio? It was valuable to understand how Dalio thought about expected value. I don’t want to misquote him here, but as a rough paraphrase, he talked about all the focus and expenditures on space exploration as the big frontier. Dalio thought about it the opposite way—namely that we should go down into the ocean, given the ocean depths are still largely unexplored. He framed the argument in terms of expected value. He said we could learn much more from ocean exploration than we could by spending the same amount on space exploration. In other words, the expected value from ocean exploration was much greater than the expected value from space exploration. I found Dalio’s perspective fascinating. I started thinking about how I could identify expected value in markets. How would you define expected value? For me, it’s having a contrarian view on a market that is very out-of-favor. For example, earlier this year [2019], corn was extremely out-of-favor. Prices were at their lowest levels in decades, and the speculative short position was larger than it had been for a very long time. That type of situation suggests there is a high expected value in being on the other side of the market, provided there is a sufficient fundamental shift to support that stance.

- [He laughs.] Dalio was saying, “Hey, you should taste this; it is really very good.” I realized that, at that point, I hadn’t eaten anything yet. Were there any other people that were influential in developing your trading methodology? Yes, Peter Brandt. [Brandt was interviewed in Chapter 1.] I have been a subscriber to Brandt’s Factor trading service for a long time. I heard he was coming to Poland, and I really wanted to meet him. I emailed his assistant and arranged to meet Peter there. I ended up having dinner and breakfast with him. Peter is so humble about his trading. He is one of those people who understands what he knows and sticks to his edge. Peter told me that it took him 8 to 10 years before he knew he had a definable edge. The fact that it took him that long really struck me. I realized I had a lot more work to do before I understood what my edge really was. After our meeting, I decided I needed to examine the characteristics of my big wins because I have a large skew in my trades. I looked at everything related to those trades: my feelings at the time, the prevailing market characteristics, and my market analysis. I was looking for common denominators in those trades in which I did very well. You had all that information on all your trades?

- I have been maintaining a daily trading journal since 2011. And Peter was the inspiration for going through your notes to examine the characteristics of your big winners? Yes, definitely. Peter writes an annual review of what he calls his “best-dressed trades,” which are the trades that provided the clearest examples of the classic chart patterns he looks for and subsequently led to the price moves implied by those patterns. So, you wanted to find out what your “best-dressed trades” looked like. Yes, exactly. What did you find? I realized an unexpected event that ran counter to the news flow was present in every one of my big winning trades. Another characteristic of these trades was that my reason for entering was very clear; I didn’t confuse my short-term and long-term views. I also noticed that these trades were never down by much and usually tended to be profitable almost immediately, whereas the trades that didn’t work tended to go offside quickly and stay offside.

- You mentioned that you record your feelings in your daily trading journal. Can you give me a specific example of how having that type of information helped you improve as a trader? I think the behavioral side of trading is an underexplored area for improving performance. Certain feelings are symptomatic of trading-related issues. For example, there was a short period when I was consistently recording feelings of frustration and FOMO [fear of missing out] in my journal. When I delved into it, I discovered that the underlying cause of this emotional disharmony was a conflict between my short-term and long-term views. What was happening was that I would have a longer-term trade on, but then I would see a chance to make money on an opposite, shorter-term bet in the same market. I would then end up trading neither view effectively.

Is there anything else that you learned from Brandt? Yes, he talks about “leakage,” which is money that you lose on trades that are not fully aligned with your process. I started tracking those types of trades in my account and saw that they were holding me back from reaching even higher levels of profits. In 2017, all my profits came from 10% of my trading days. It’s so critical to avoid marginal trades because they waste monetary and psychological capital. Peter’s trading approach is 100% chart-based, whereas your trading is driven by fundamentals.

- indicators and only looks at charts, a perspective that resonates with the way I look at markets as well. I take it then that the broad price picture can influence your trading. It can. I believe that long-term chart patterns are important, especially prolonged consolidations. You can’t tell when they will break, but when they do, it can often lead to major price moves. Can you give me an example of a trade where the chart price action was a significant element? One trade immediately comes to mind because it is such a classic example. It goes back quite a while, though. That doesn’t make any difference; it’s the example that counts. In early May 2013, the Australian dollar had been in a trading consolidation for a long time. On this day [he points to May 9, 2013 on the price chart], you had one of those disconfirming days where the economic data, an employment report, was very strong, but the market broke out on the downside of its long-term range. The employment report was not just bullish, but really bullish. The market had expected an 11,000 figure, and the number came in at 50,000. Also, the unemployment rate went down, while the participation rate went up. The report was bullish in every possible way. The data came out 2:30 in the morning European time. There was an initial rally on the report, but by the time I got into the office at 7 a.m., the market had already sold off, with prices trading below the long-running consolidation pattern that I had been watching. I saw the data that had come out and the subsequent price action, and, straightaway, I just started selling. I didn’t think; I just went short immediately. Do you do anything differently when you are in a losing period? I have a systematic process for cutting my size down when I am in a drawdown.

People are often preoccupied with being intellectually correct, which can be a hindrance to making money. When I started, my attitude was that I didn’t know anything. So, I always worked backward from the market moves rather than forward from personal opinions.

- What are the trading rules you live by? It’s interesting, in the beginning, a lot of my rules and principles came from what the traders in your Market Wizards book said. Over time, these rules changed to fit my personality and what worked for me. These are the rules I have now: To paraphrase Adam Robinson, genius is knowing that you have a hammer and only looking for nails. The point is that I need to stick with what I do well. The risk/reward on a trade is quite dynamic and can change dramatically as you hold it. Therefore, I need to be flexible in covering part of my position as a trade moves in my favor. Otherwise, I am implicitly assuming that I’m going to be 100% right. I learned this rule through multiple experiences of having a big profit on a trade and then seeing the market reverse quickly while I was still holding the full position. I have a drawdown alert, which is a personalized rule. I have noticed that three things seem to be present at the beginning of every drawdown I have experienced: a 2% or greater loss in a single day; a loss of significant open profits in a trade; a big size trade doesn’t pay off—a trade that I think is a major opportunity and put on in size and that then ends up being a wash. Another personalized rule is to be cognizant of certain feelings that are a warning sign that I may be getting out of sync with the markets. The keywords I watch out for in my daily trading review notes are FOMO and frustration. Seek clarity over certainty. Trying to reach for certainty will keep you from acting. Always be prepared for what could go wrong. Know what you will do if the opposite of what you think will occur happens. Always trade an opportunity for what it is, not what you want it to be. For example, if I receive only a partial fill on a trade, I might be tempted to run the trade further than usual to compensate for the smaller size. Doing so would violate my process and generally lead to worse outcomes.  Always make sure your stops are set at a point that disproves your market hypothesis; never use a monetary stop—a stop point selected because it is the amount of money you’re willing to risk. If you are tempted to use a monetary stop, it is a sure sign that your position size is too large. Don’t sweat the trades you missed that you weren’t prepared to take in the first place. The markets provide a constant stream of opportunities. As long as the sun rises tomorrow, there will be another day I can make money. It is not something I have to worry about. What advice would you give to a starting trader? I get asked this question quite a lot, and I find it difficult to answer. I generally advise against seeking a trading career because most people are not willing to put in the amount of effort that is needed to succeed. One problem with markets and speculation is that luck plays such a significant role in the short term, which can fool people into thinking their profits are due to skill, even when they aren’t. It takes a… ([Location 3187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3187))

- Dhaliwal makes the critical point—one that is often overlooked—that the reward/risk ratio of a trade is dynamic and can change dramatically as the trade is held. As an example, consider that you implement a trade, looking for a 300-point gain and risking a 100-point loss. If the market then moves 200 points in favor of the trade, the reward/risk is now drastically different than when the position was implemented. Dhaliwal manages the dynamic nature of reward/risk in a trade by taking partial profits. He argues that holding the entire position until it is exited is an attempt to be 100% right, at the risk of being 100% wrong. Taking partial profits as a trade moves in your favor not only responds to the fact that the reward/risk of the trade is changing, but it is also another risk management tool. If the market abruptly reverses against your position, the action of having taken partial profits will mitigate the profit surrender or reduce the loss. Although Dhaliwal didn’t discuss it, another way of adjusting to the changing reward/risk of a trade that moves in the anticipated direction is to tighten the protective stop commensurately. Protective stops should be placed at a point that disproves your trade hypothesis. Using a closer stop because it represents the maximum amount of money you are willing to risk is an indication that your position is too large. The implication is that you should reduce your position size so that you can choose a meaningful stop that is also consistent with the amount of money you’re willing to risk on the trade. Know what you will do if you are wrong. Dhaliwal plans out his trades, knowing how he will respond in each possible scenario. Defining your trade management plan before you get into a trade is far preferable to doing so after you have placed the position. Why? Because before you are in the trade, you have the advantage of making decisions with full objectivity. Once you are in the position, you lose this advantage.

The only thing that matters is whether you are profitable, not whether your market theories are correct. One of Dhaliwal’s rules is: Seek clarity over certainty. The markets are not about certainty; they are about probabilities. Waiting for trades that approach the ideal of certainty, or near certainty, will lead to inaction and missing many trades that offer good probabilistic bets.

A lot of the training you do as a Marine is to create such a stressful environment that when the real thing happens, you can function. The first night you are in boot camp, after three hours of sleep, they are banging the garbage can lid screaming, “Get out of the rack! Get out of the rack!” You have 90 days left, and the first day felt like it was three weeks. I’ve had trading days that didn’t go well and felt like three weeks. I go long, and the market goes down; I go short, and the market goes up. Trading is a hard way to make an easy living. The Marines taught me to deal with adversity, and that ability has been essential to my success as a trader. You need to be able to deal with getting stopped out five times in a row and still stick with your process. The Marines train you to deal with setbacks.

- When did you resume trading? Not long afterward, I developed a methodology based on trading Fibonacci retracements. [A Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...). The ratio of one number in the series to the following number approaches 61.8% as numbers get larger, and the ratio of one number to the second following number in the series approaches 38.2%. The Fibonacci sequence occurs commonly in nature, such as in the spirals formed by some shells and flower petals. Fibonacci traders will look for potential market reversals to occur near the aforementioned key ratios: 61.8% and 38.2%.] ([Location 3409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3409))

- Can you give me an example of what you mean by market narrative? The narrative is another term for the market regime. For example, five-year Treasury notes are paying 1.5% right now. The dividend yield on the S&P is 2.8%. [This interview was conducted in August 2019.] The dominant market narrative is that, given the significant yield advantage in the S&P, money will flow into equities. In this type of environment, it’s challenging to be short the S&P. Instead, you want to be buying the S&P near key technical points because real investment flows will be there, providing fundamental support. As another example, we are currently in a regime where there is a massive chase for yield. There is $17 trillion of negative yield instruments out there. This regime largely explains what is fueling the ongoing bull market in gold. Why? Because, in a sense, gold is a zero yielding currency. The fact that gold yields zero makes it a better asset to hold that $17 trillion of assets you have to pay to own. That factor is the big driver of gold right now. So, if you have this type of favorable regime for gold, does that imply that you only trade gold from the long side, as long as conditions remain conducive for the market chasing yield? That’s predominantly true, but not always. What would prompt you to go short in the face of this long-term bullish factor that you have argued is, currently, the driving force behind gold’s price movement? You could get an event that will cause a sharp countermovement in the price of gold. For example, if, unexpectedly, there is talk that Europe will implement fiscal stimulus, European bonds will go through a headline-scare correction. That event would cause gold to sell off because it has been benefiting from a negative yield environment. Also, if a narrative is widely followed, eventually, the trade can get crowded, making the market vulnerable to a sharp countermove, especially if there is a surprise event adverse to the prevailing narrative. So then you might play a short-term correction in gold, even if you are long-term bullish. Absolutely, because when you get these sustained, long-term trends, and there is a surprise event, the corrections can be violent. Can you give me an example of a specific trade that was driven by your interpretation of the market narrative? In May 2013, then Chairman Bernanke indicated that the Fed was going to move from calendar-based to data-driven decisions in determining interest rate adjustments. What does that mean? It means that any economic data—job numbers, retail sales, etc.—was going to be more impactful than before. Bernanke’s comments changed the market narrative. On July 5, 2013, the Employment Report showed a large number of jobs being added. Although I was already positioned short Treasurys before the report, I shorted a lot more because I thought the figure would have a larger-than-expected impact, given the Fed’s recent switch from calendar-based to data-based guidance.

- narrative for the first three quarters, and I did quite well trading gold primarily from the long side. But what I missed was that when the world became concerned about deflation, gold would sell off with the rest of the market, which is what happened in the fourth quarter of 2008. I also missed the fact that because they were being hit by large withdrawals, many hedge funds had to raise money, and hedge funds were primarily long gold. So they had to sell gold along with everything else. So far, we have talked about how technical analysis and the market narrative play a role in your trading methodology. What else is important? Event trading has probably been the most important contributor to my trading profits during the past 10 years. There are both unplanned events and planned events.

- What is the broader lesson that comes out of that trade? The lesson is that you have to understand the market narrative, so you know what is and isn’t a surprise and act accordingly. But you have to know it is a surprise. If you trade without knowing, you are just a sucker giving your money away, and you will likely be near the high tick on the buy and the low tick on the sell. So, your event trading is intricately tied to your market narrative. Absolutely! The narrative will determine how you interpret market events. You can have the same event have very different price impacts depending on the market narrative. For example, if no one expects OPEC to cut production, and they cut production, the energy markets will be caught offside, and you can have a significant price response. On the other hand, if the same size cut occurs, but it is widely anticipated, there may be no price reaction at all, or the market might even reverse once the news is out. So knowing the market narrative is critical to my event trading. It also makes my technical analysis more effective by giving me insight as to when a particular chart formation would be more likely to result in a large price move.

- But if the number was that bearish, wouldn’t the market go limit down instantaneously? [Limit down is the maximum permitted daily price decline.] You are assuming markets are efficient, but they are not efficient. The market went limit down, but it didn’t go there immediately. I was able to get short almost instantaneously because of MPACT. ([Location 3537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3537))

- What is MPACT? MPACT, an acronym for market price action, is the software program that I showed you earlier this morning, which reads and evaluates the news in milliseconds and then enters the appropriate order. So, in your software, you have predefined what trade action to take for each possible estimate value the USDA might release. Correct. Execution is critical. I invested a substantial portion of my trading profits and net worth in building MPACT, which is an event interpretation application. The software trades the market price action consistent with predetermined scenarios for an event. A big part of what I do is defining 20, 30, 40 potential scenarios before the event, as well as the trade action associated with each scenario. I can spend a week preparing for a Fed event dissecting multiple qualitative aspects. When I build a score for a Fed event, I’ll have a framework to interpret what the Fed says in regards to four things: (1) the economy; (2) inflation; (3) future rate paths; and (4) any idiosyncratic factors. These four factors are dynamically weighted. Accordingly, MPACT will read the Fed release and evaluate it for each of these four areas and generate a score. Then MPACT will select the prepared scenario based on the score from the statement. Each scenario will also specify the trades to be taken, if any. Is this software that you created? I designed it and hired a development team to do the programming. The project took six years to build and refine. Can you give me an example of how MPACT traded a Fed announcement? In December 2018, I thought that the Fed would not hike rates—despite the market pricing in nearly a 100% chance of a hike—and that if they did raise rates, the announcement would include some indication that they were done hiking. Instead, Fed Chairman Powell’s comments included the line, “It is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year.” That one line was enough to send the markets crashing. Although it was in total contradiction to your expectations, did your prepared scenarios include the Fed indicating there would be a couple more hikes?

- They sure did. I was long the S&P and gold going into the announcement because I was expecting the Fed wouldn’t hike. MPACT automatically sold me out of my positions and reversed to the short side. Okay, that’s a clear-cut example. However, what about the case where there are statements with contradictory implications within the same announcement? Yes, that happened in March 2017, it was my worst trading day ever. I thought that if the Fed left the door open for another hike in June, it would be very bearish for the interest rate markets. The Fed did that, and I went heavily short the five-year T-notes. I lost $210,000 that day, giving back all my profits year to date. What exactly was the mistake? Although the Fed indicated the likelihood of a June hike, the overall statement contained a score of other dovish elements, some that I had failed to anticipate in my scenario creation… ([Location 3560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3560))

- Let’s discuss emotions and trading. I know you have a contrarian view on the subject. Can you elaborate on how you see the influence of emotions in trading? Emotions are your friend, not your enemy. The human emotions that we feel can be used as a signal source. Let me give you a specific trade as an example. In September 2015, the S&P rolled over and broke down sharply to the area of the August relative low. I was overwhelmed by this animalistic sense that the S&P was going to crash. I went short 200 E-mini S&P contracts, which was way too large a position for me. Part of my trading process is to ask myself where I am on the emotional scale. Am I highly afraid? Am I highly greedy? Or, am I emotionally balanced somewhere between the two? That was an instance where I was at one end of the emotional spectrum—highly greedy. When I asked myself, “What is your respect for the risk level right now?” I realized the answer was, “None.” I felt that shorting right there without any process behind me was free money. As soon as I realized that, I covered my entire position immediately. The best positions for me are when I still have some element of unease. I assess the tension in my body when I am in a trade. I want to be focused and still feel some anxiety. In contrast, if I exhale in relief after a position has gone my way and feel too relaxed, that is a warning sign of a possible impending market reversal. If I buy gold at $1,500, and it then goes to $1,530, and I feel, “I nailed this trade; I better buy more before it runs away,” I can assure you, it will be back to $1,518 in no time. So, ironically, you would be more inclined to add to a position when you still feel nervous about it, not when you feel really confident. Yes! Correct! You are saying that people like me who advise traders to get the emotionality out of trading are wrong. Oh, my God! Why would you want to do that? You would be throwing away a useful signal source. If you have to choose one, would you rather replicate the trades of the three most… ([Location 3571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=3571))

- When I tell people to get emotions out of trading, it is because emotional trades are usually wrong. But what you are saying is that your proxy for the worst traders—a valuable indicator—is being aware of your own emotional extremes. Exactly! You need to understand your own emotionality, journal it, and potentially develop it as another signal source for what you do. Contrast the characteristics that differentiate winning traders from losing traders. Winning traders get the joke. They realize that they can lose even when they do everything right. Winning traders have a process, the discipline to follow the process, and a commitment to strive for continuous improvement. They understand that even incremental improvements can have a profound effect on their P&L. Losing traders are looking for a silver bullet, and if it doesn’t work immediately, they are onto the next thing.

- One theme that has cropped up in several of the interviews in this book, including this one, is the concept that a counter-to-expected market response to a news development can provide a valuable timing signal. President Bush’s ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, which signaled the imminent start of the Second Gulf War, was viewed as a bearish development, especially with equities still near the lows of a two-year-long bear market. The market opened lower on the news, as expected, but then reversed, closing sharply higher. This unexpected price action signaled the beginning of a long-term bull market. Another example of the same principle was provided by the stock market price action on election night 2016. It was widely assumed that Trump would lose the election and that in the unlikely event he won, the market would sell off sharply. When the returns started to make it clear that Trump would win an upset victory, equities began to tank precisely as anticipated. But then prices reversed their initial losses and moved sharply higher throughout the night. This unexpected market response to the news marked the start of a near uninterrupted 14-month run-up in stock prices.

- How would you define your trading methodology? I look at trading like a puzzle; I have to get the four corners in first. What are the four corners? The first corner is technical analysis; you have to have the right chart pattern. The second corner is a clean share structure. What do you mean by that? The stock has few or no options or warrants, and preferably, there are fewer than 200 million shares. What are the other two corners? Being in the right sector and having a catalyst or story that will make the stock or sector move up. ([Location 4039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4039))

- So how was Neumann able to use a type of technical signal of such questionable efficacy with such incredible effectiveness? The key is that the trendline breakout is only one component of his overall strategy. By itself, buying trendline breakouts is a loser’s game. However, knowing which breakouts to buy is what makes Neumann’s trading approach so effective. Neumann’s core trades share many, if not all, of the following characteristics: The stock has seen a large decline or an extended sideways movement near lows. The company has a service or product that suggests considerable upside potential. There is a catalyst to suggest the prospect for an imminent price rally. The stock is part of a sector that Neumann has defined as being primed for a substantial upward price move. ([Location 4088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4088))

- He is familiar with the product and has usually tried it himself. The stock is showing some signs of life—either a sudden upmove after an extended period of decline or sideways price movement, or an abrupt spike in volume after a lengthy period of relative inactivity, or both. When most, if not all, of these elements are in place, Neumann is primed to look for his breakout. So what looks like a simple trade of buying a downtrend line breakout—one of the most basic technical signals that can be imagined—is a far more complex trade taking into account a gamut of factors that have to be appropriately lined up. There is another essential factor that explains how Neumann can be so successful using the mundane approach of trend breakouts for trade signals, and it has nothing to do with trade entry. Neumann buys a stock right at the moment he thinks it is ready to go (for example, at the cusp of a critical breakout where he is taking out the last portion of a large sell order). If after Neumann buys the stock, it fails to follow through on the upside, let alone begins to drift back down, Neumann will exit the trade immediately. Because he enters a trade at a point at which there is likely to be at least some minor follow-through, even if the trade ends up being wrong, Neumann can typically get out not far from breakeven. So Neumann’s phenomenal track record is not merely a matter of a superior trade entry strategy—although he certainly has one—but also his unflinching ability to exit trades without hesitation when they are not behaving as he expected them to. His exit strategy is steeped in risk control, whether he thinks of it in these terms or not. It is fascinating to compare Neumann’s technical entry signal with Peter Brandt’s (see Chapter 1). Neumann only wants to buy breakouts from downtrend lines because they will provide a better entry price (when the signal is valid), and he is willing to accept the greater number of false signals to get this better price. Brandt uses the exact opposite approach: He avoids trendline breakouts because he considers them unreliable. He only wants to buy breakouts from horizontal consolidations because their greater reliability allows for the placement of a protective stop that is both meaningful and close. The two traders have opposite perspectives about technical trade entry signals, yet both are very successful—a classic illustration of the principle that there is no single correct trading methodology.

- Whereas Neumann and Brandt provide a study of contrasts in terms of trade entry timing, it is noteworthy that Neumann’s trade exit timing is the embodiment of the contrarian trading philosophy expressed by Jason Shapiro (see Chapter 2): “I try to find out what everyone is doing, and I do the opposite because when everyone is in the same trade, they lose money.” This sentence provides a good description of how Neumann exits trades. In virtually all the major trades discussed in this interview, Neumann exited when the trade became popularized. Consider the following examples: He sold out of his ethanol stocks the day the bill to increase the ethanol content in gasoline went to Congress—a point of peak media coverage. He liquidated his 3D printing stocks once they become popular enough to be the subject CNBC coverage and widespread chat room conversations.… ([Location 4115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4115))

- You need to stick to your methodology and trading plan. Beware of being enamored by an unplanned trade. Neumann’s biggest loss (in percentage terms) came early in his career when he deviated from the market-making strategy that was generating steady returns to impulsively buy a stock that was soaring based on a good story. That one trade wiped out 30% of his account in one day. It is striking how many of Neumann’s most successful trades were dead wrong from a long-term perspective. 3D printer stocks and Organovo surrendered their entire advance, ultimately declining to levels even lower than where Neumann had first bought them. Spongetech proved to be a scam and became worthless. The point is that what matters is not what a stock does long term, but instead what it does while you are holding it. Neumann’s entry and exit techniques protected him from any substantial loss, while still allowing him to experience windfall gains. Successful trading is a matter of skillful money management (expressed via entry and exit methodologies), not prediction. A lot of Neumann’s trades seem like pure luck. For example, his getting out of the CBD water stock near the absolute high because the store clerk happened to tell him about the impurity problem. But think about it: Neumann put himself in the position to be lucky. It was only because of his on-the-ground research and his continual monitoring of local store sales that he was in the store to get that valuable news. The BlackBerry message he received while on safari in Kenya on the day Spongetech made its all-time high was a bit of extraordinary luck. But it was only because Neumann had the right instincts to immediately liquidate his position during the market buying hysteria that this message made a difference. The Spongetech trade also provides a perfect illustration of a trading principle noted in Hedge Fund Market Wizards: “If you are on the right side of euphoria or panic, lighten up. Parabolic price moves in either direction tend to end abruptly and sharply. If you are fortunate enough to be on the right side of a market in which the price move turns near vertical, consider scaling out of the position while the trend is still moving in your direction. If you would be petrified to be on the other side of the market, that is probably a good sign that you should be lightning your position.”15 Readers of Peter Lynch’… ([Location 4125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4125))

For example, when the iPhone was coming out, you might ask people the question, “Would you buy a phone without a keyboard?” And people would say, “No, I would never buy a phone without a keyboard.” I saw so much of this disconnect between what people said and what they did that I lost complete faith in market research as an industry.

- Can you elaborate on your methodology for identifying those high-conviction trades? I call what I do “social arbitrage.” What the word “social” means to me is that it is something not financial. My trading is dependent on my ability to identify meaningful off-radar information early—information that is either not recognized or is underappreciated by the investment public. In some ways, my focus was the inverse of what it was during my garage sale years. In my purchases at garage sales, I was focused on male-oriented items that female garage sale organizers had mispriced. I quickly realized that a lot of the biases on Wall Street provided opportunities for me to identify information that was either female-oriented, or youth-oriented, ([Location 4331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4331))

- oriented, or rural-oriented. I don’t want to say that my methodology is totally dependent on those areas, but in my earlier years, it focused on those areas. I immersed myself in fashion and pop culture—things that are entirely off the radar screen of the typical Wall Street trader or fund manager. How did you spot trading opportunities? I would term it as retraining your brain. You are still living your normal life, but you are observing in a very different way. Anytime I uncovered anything that was potentially meaningful, I would follow up with more research. For example, when Wendy’s announced their pretzel bacon cheeseburger back in 2013, I went out to observe as much as I could. I spoke to the managers at a dozen different Wendy’s locations. I asked them how many years they had been at Wendy’s and how this item compared with other past seasonal items. And every time the answer I got was the same: “We’ve never seen anything like this before.” I spoke to the customers about what they thought. But you are only surveying consumer sentiment in Dallas. How do you know it’s at all representative of what’s happening in the country as a whole? ([Location 4337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4337))

- What is amazing about Dallas is that it may just be one of the most representative markets in the country. I also looked at different online chat sites where people talk about fast food. I know that sounds crazy, but these sites exist. It was a great trade that was totally missed by Wall Street. Every fast-food chain has a seasonal item they introduce, usually in the spring. Typically, these items come in and go away, and it’s no big deal. This item, however, was so large that it moved the needle for the entire company. Because that type of impact had not happened before, it wasn’t on the radar of people who follow the stock. Out of the many trades you’ve made in your career, do any stand out as particularly painful? Ironically, one of my most regretful trades was also one of my largest winners.

- Under Armour made it for the masses. They had a wider distribution of this type of product than anyone ever had. How did you spot the consumer trend? I spotted that trend off of social media. I have a large number of proprietary word groups that I monitor every evening. At the time, I was monitoring a word combination that included ColdGear, Under Armour, and some other words. I measure the conversational volume of the word groups I follow, and if I see the volume is abnormally high, that is the first signal for me that something is up. I spend only about four hours a day on trade research and analysis, but when I find something like the Under Armour trade, I will spend 14 or 15 hours a day for days or even weeks on due diligence. What specifically do you mean by due diligence? I will try to accumulate every bit of data I can that is related to my trade. I start with a hypothesis. In this particular case, my hypothesis was that Under Armour was experiencing exceptional sales of their ColdGear products. Then I have to test my hypothesis. I interviewed store managers and consumers. I went online and scoured every piece of information related to my assumption. I had full corroboration by virtually every piece of information I checked. It was one of the largest trades I ever made. When I have a high-conviction trade, I can get to the point where I have 95% plus confidence in the trade. But even with that high level of confidence, it doesn’t necessarily mean I will make money on the trade. There are always external factors at play. Why was this one of your most regretful trades? Because several days before Under Armour reported earnings, Lululemon came out with their earnings, and it was a disaster. Were Under Armour and Lululemon correlated?

- Not long after the 2008 election, Michelle Obama wore a yellow J.Crew dress on Jay Leno’s Tonight Show. I watched that episode. This event was one of the most defining moments for J.Crew in a decade. After that show, Michelle Obama was on the cover of almost every tabloid and fashion magazine. Immediately after that, the African American demographic completely embraced J.Crew as a brand. I totally missed that trade. But you saw it at the time. You recognized the trade. I didn’t recognize it. I saw it, but I didn’t observe it. Missing the trade was so impactful for me that I went on eBay and bought the dress. I have the dress in my closet; I could show it to you. Why did you buy the dress? Was it to stare you in the face as a reminder of that missed trade? Yes. I wanted it to remind me of how much opportunity is out there that I am missing every day. Missing that trade made me realize that for every trade that I found using this methodology, I was missing dozens. How did that change you? I knew I had to figure out a better way to apply my methodology. I needed to capture more data. I had to figure out how to broaden the funnel. I was doing really well with this methodology, and I thought, “If I am missing 10X and maybe even 100X more trades, how big could this get?” Why do you think you missed that trade? My methodology is so easy that, theoretically, anybody could do it. At the same time, it is so hard. When you see a big movement in a stock price, there is a reason why that price change happened. In many cases, the price moved because there is some inflection point in demand for that company’s services or products. Was there a way to identify that change early? I knew those opportunities existed, but I couldn’t figure out how to capture more of them. The opportunities I was catching were very random and based on my physicality—where I was, and what I saw at that moment in time. One of my best friends had twins, and his wife had a post on Facebook. Paraphrasing, the post said, “My twins were silent for the first time in their lives. I thought something tragic had happened in my house. I ran up to the playroom and found them staring at the TV, watching the show Chuggington. This show is my savior.” Then other mothers started posting about how their kids were obsessed with the show. Let’s say you are a portfolio manager, and you see this post from your friend’s wife, are you going to do anything? It is probably something you read for a few seconds and then move on to the next thing. I was proud of myself for stopping and thinking, “What is Chuggington?” I googled Chuggington and found that it was a program produced by a small company in Europe that fortunately happened to be publicly traded. I realized they would probably get some big license deals because of the show’s popularity in the US. I invested in the company, and about four months later, that stock was up 50%.

- I put up $1 million of my trading profits to launch the company, TickerTags, and we also raised a few million dollars. Wouldn’t the value of these tags be dependent on the skill of the people who were putting them together? How did you know these 40 students were doing the task correctly? I coached them on how to curate tags for a company. Each student had a list of companies. For each company on their list, they were instructed to research the company, research quarterly earnings reports, find news articles about the company, all with an end goal of identifying the price drivers for that company. They would tag any word associated with anything that could move the needle for the company. For example, “pretzel bacon cheeseburger” would be a tag for Wendy’s. We eventually got to over one million tags mapped to over 2,000 companies. We could detect conversational anomalies and understand whether there was more or less interest in a granular topic than a particular benchmark, whether that benchmark was internal to the company—a comparison to a previous year—or whether the benchmark was a competing product.

I often have people say, “So, you’re trying to predict the future in people’s behavior.” That’s incorrect. I’m not trying to predict the future; I am trying to accurately and quickly depict the present. I’m not trying to predict what people will do, but rather identify what they are doing right now. What are they interested in right now? What are they buying right now? People talk about something when it is happening or immediately before it happens. In my world, that is the earliest point at which you can detect change. Why then do you subscribe to transactional data when you already have the earlier signal provided by social information? I subscribe to transactional data because I want to understand when the information I have is being disseminated. Oh, so you use the transactional data as your exit. Yes, when I believe it indicates the information has already been sufficiently disseminated. Do you have any examples of where an increase in online chatter led to a shorting opportunity?

- Sure. I love cultural shifts because Wall Street is always late catching on. There was a cultural shift of women going from traditional bras to wireless bras or wearing no bra at all. Very early on, I was able to detect that women were talking more and more about going “braless” or wearing “bralettes,” which is how they referred to wireless bras. If you look at Victoria’s Secret, they are famous for the traditional wired, push-up bra, which is their brand image. I knew this trend was going to be destructive to their brand. It was so obvious if you were monitoring the conversational frequency of the terms “braless” and “bralette.” Wall Street didn’t see it at all. I assume you bought puts to take advantage of the trade idea. Yes, I bought short-term puts before each of two consecutive earnings reports, and both trades worked out very well. Any other shorting examples? Yes, here is one of my all-time favorite trades. I’m sure you remember when the E. coli scare hit Chipotle. I sure do. There was a tremendous amount of work done on Wall Street to determine the impact of the E. coli scare ([Location 4516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4516))

- on foot traffic at Chipotle. Before this E. coli scare, Chipotle had become famous for having long lines at lunchtime. Chipotle was such a trendy brand that it was common for people to tweet about having lunch there. They would also frequently tweet about how they were waiting in line at Chipotle. I was able to gauge real-time foot traffic by monitoring word combinations, such as “Chipotle” plus “lunch,” and “Chipotle” plus “line,” in online conversations. Almost overnight, the mentions of these word combinations dropped by about 50%. When the E. coli news came out, it was on all the evening news channels. Didn’t the stock take an immediate dive? The stock took an immediate dive, but not remotely close to the decline it ultimately experienced. The general market perception was that the E. coli scare wouldn’t have a long-lasting impact. No one anticipated the extraordinary… ([Location 4527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4527))

- Why did you decide to sell TickerTags? A few years ago, we received a call from Twitter, informing us that our data rates were going to increase in the coming years, and the amount of increase was very substantial. We had to decide whether to raise another $5 million in venture capital or sell the company, and we decided to sell the company. I built TickerTags, not because I thought it was a good idea that other people would like, but because it was something I knew that I needed to have. So, here we are today, TickerTags is no longer my company, and I get to be a client. I assume you get a free subscription. I am still a consultant to the company. I’m helping them to refine the platform because I am knee-deep into it. I appreciate the platform more than any other client. Do you get paid for being a consultant? I get a free subscription to TickerTags, which is a very expensive platform. The subscriptions are only available to hedge funds and banks. Aren’t you concerned that having this tool available to hedge funds and proprietary trading operations will compromise its effectiveness? No, because I think it will be a very long time before hedge funds are going to have the confidence in this tool that I have. In fact, while we were developing TickerTags, I would often share my trade ideas with hedge funds. Did you share the ideas after you put on the trades?

- I would speak freely about my trades with hedge funds, even if I was only partially positioned. Weren’t you concerned that sharing the information would move the trade before you fully got in? No, because I knew these guys wouldn’t move on the information. This type of methodology is so foreign to them that their lack of comfort and confidence in this approach would lead them to move much more slowly on the trade than I would, if they made the trade at all. I used to ask myself, why isn’t Wall Street digging in deeper into my methodology? I never understood it until I started TickerTags. After it launched, I was in New York every other week for two years straight. I met with almost every top hedge fund. These managers were some of the smartest people I have ever met. Their world is really noisy. They have a hundred different ways to look at things. They are so entrenched in doing things a certain way that for them to adopt what I do would be radical and extreme. They can’t look at something like conversational volume impacting a specific stock because there is no history there. They want to see high correlation to trust the data. I can’t say that every time conversational volume peaked in the way it did for Netflix, the stock moved. It was a one-of-a-kind event. You have to understand and interpret this data. You have to be willing to trust it. Hedge fund managers want something repeatable and systematic. They wanted to know how often this approach would generate tradable information with high conviction. I couldn’t give them a hard answer. It could be a handful of times a year; it could be 25 times a year. They want things that are repeatable and work for thousands of tickers. They have a lack of comfort with the variability in how this data is applied, but I don’t. Unless the methodology is your own, you won’t trust it. I don’t know what percent of systems sold to the public have any value. But, I always tell people that even if 90% plus of the systems sold make money with reasonable risk—a drastic overstatement I’m sure—I would bet that over 90% of the people who purchased those systems would still lose money. Why? Because every system or method will have its losing periods, and if you don’t have confidence in the approach, which you won’t if the methodology is not your own, you will abandon it. You’re coming to hedge funds with a strategy they have never used, so they can never have your conviction. It even took you many years to get to that point.

- Not just many years; it took me over a decade to get to the point where I had high conviction in my methodology. When you get a volume spike in one of your tags, couldn’t it just as well be bearish as bullish? I look at the context of the conversation. It doesn’t take long to determine the narrative. I will never trade on data alone. Every trade I do has a thesis with a narrative associated with it. I will use a trade I am in right now as an example. About two months ago, I noticed a conversational spike in e.l.f., a manufacturer of low-priced cosmetics, that hadn’t been doing too well in the past few years. That alone didn’t tell me anything. Was there a spike because people liked a product or because they were complaining about a product? Some further checking revealed the spike could be traced to a video made by a makeup tutorial artist named Jeffree Star, who has 15 million followers on YouTube. Jeffree had made a video where on half his face, he used an e.l.f. product that is sold at Walgreens and Target and costs about $8, and on the other half of his face, he used a top-selling product that costs $60. He said that the $8 product was as good as the $60 product. He instantaneously changed the consumer perception of the e.l.f. brand from being viewed as a cheap drugstore product to being considered a quality product. The stock moved up more than 50% in two months. The odd thing is that I bet that most analysts who cover e.l.f. have no idea who Jeffree Star is. Are there cases where you used the same word combination for both bullish and bearish trades? Sure, Smith & Wesson is a good example. The combination of the words “gun” plus “class” is a good indication of the degree to which people are buying guns. “Gun” and “class”? Yes, class. Interesting, right? When people go out and purchase a gun for the first time, they start searching for gun classes. Another word combination that is a good indicator of gun sales is “gun” plus “ban.” So anytime I saw a spike in the number of people concerned about guns being banned and also people looking for gun classes, I would view it as an early sign that gun sales were increasing. I used these word combinations as a buy signal for American Outdoors Brand Corporation, the maker of Smith & Wesson, multiple times. I also used it as a bearish signal when Trump came into office. There was a notable drop in people… ([Location 4590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4590))

- You said earlier that there were over a million tags on TickerTags. Clearly, you can’t follow more than a small sliver of these tags. How do you decide which tags to follow, and how do you avoid still missing most opportunities? There is no way I can look at all the granular tags. Instead, I use what I call “umbrella tags.” These tags are word combinations that allow me to detect early on when any topic is erupting on social media and give me insight into what other tags I should be looking at. Can you give me an example of an umbrella tag? The word combination “obsessed” plus “new” plus “game” will alert me when there is any new game that is sparking an upsurge in online conversation. So that umbrella tag would clue me in as to what specific game tag I need to start following at that moment, even if I had never heard of the game before.

- How is that word combination different from any of the other word combinations we talked about, such as “gun” and “class,” or “roof,” “hail,” and “damage”? What makes it a so-called “umbrella tag”? An umbrella tag is going to pick up on anything in a category. For example, if toys are a category, I may have hundreds or even thousands of related words that I may occasionally look at. But if I look at the word “toy” and an emotional word, such as “obsessed,” connected to it, I will be able to identify if anything is happening in the toy sector that is an anomaly that day. So an umbrella tag is a word combination that can signal something happening anywhere in an entire sector rather than something specific to one particular stock? Exactly. Some umbrella tags are even more general than a sector and are intended to capture anything that is trending. What is an example of a very general umbrella tag? The phrase “I can’t find” followed by anything. I’m pretty tight-lipped about the exact umbrella tags I use, especially those that are broad in coverage. What is an example of a trade that was signaled by a general umbrella tag? ([Location 4630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4630))

- A few years ago, a general umbrella tag uncovered a spike in mentions of “Elmer’s glue.” At first, this spike seemed somewhat perplexing. Why Elmer’s glue? Some further checking revealed that the mentions of Elmer’s glue were associated with DIY slime [do-it-yourself slime]. At the time, there was a big trend of kids playing with slime. The main ingredient in slime is Elmer’s glue, and Elmer’s glue was selling out everywhere. Who makes Elmer’s glue? Newell Brands. How big a part of their product line is Elmer’s glue? That’s what’s interesting. Elmer’s glue was a small piece of Newell Brands, but Newell Brands was a very slow-growing company. Looking at how big the trend in slime was, I assumed that sales of Elmer’s glue would increase by a minimum of 50%, and possibly as much as 100%. That type of increase would significantly move the needle for the company because their growth was only about 1.5% per year.… ([Location 4642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4642))

- Can you describe your trading process from getting in to getting out? Whenever I come across a piece of information that I think the market doesn’t know or is not paying attention to, I have to determine whether it can move the needle for the company. Sometimes the company is so big, and the information is so limited in scope, that it doesn’t make any difference. If I believe the information could potentially be significant, I then have to determine to what degree it has already been disseminated to the investment public. If it’s already market knowledge, then I have to assume it is reflected in the price. If the information is both significant and not yet disseminated, I then have to research whether there might be any extraneous factors that could meaningfully impact the company during the time window of my trade. Is there any impending lawsuit, or management change, or new product line, or anything that could trump the information I am trading on? Once I have excluded all the factors that could nullify the relevance of the information, I then conclude there is what I term an “information imbalance.” What is interesting about this methodology is that I apply it completely blind to other fundamentals in the company and the price action. I don’t care if the company is overvalued or undervalued. I assume that the stock is trading relatively efficiently on the information that is out there. Then once this new information is added to the picture, the stock should adjust accordingly. The last step is to define the trade window so that I can determine the appropriate option to purchase. For example, if I were trading Disney based on the expectation that a new movie would be a larger-than-expected hit, I would buy options that expire beyond the opening weekend. I want to select options that expire as soon after the expected information dissemination as possible to keep my option premium expenditures as low as possible. Typically, the option expiration will revolve… ([Location 4653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4653))

- I have only one piece of information that the market is not seeing or appreciating, but there are lots of things that could drive the stock price. As an analogy, my methodology is like playing roulette and betting on red because you know five black numbers have been removed from the wheel. It’s not that I know an investment is going to work out; it’s a knowledge edge. The second the information I am trading on hits the street, whether it’s through analysis by a sell-side firm, or a media story, or the company itself reporting it, I call that “information parity,” and my trade is over. I must sell immediately when information parity happens. I only invest when there is an information imbalance, and I must sell when there is information parity. Is that true whether or not you’re making money on the trade? Whether a trade has a… ([Location 4672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=4672))

- I could never be a good fundamental or technical trader because I don’t enjoy those methodologies. The four hours I spend every night doing my analysis is something that I love. I never know when I’m going to hit on that thing that will take me down the path to my next big trade. It’s the same feeling I had as a kid going to garage sales. Every night I start the process, and I don’t know what I’m going to find. I enjoy doing my nightly analysis; that’s why I think I’m good at it. The things I do are so different from other traders. You would have a hard time finding someone who is more risk-tolerant than I am. I never use stop losses. Most traders will say, “Never add to a losing position.” If I am in a losing position and nothing has changed in the information dissemination, I will double down. I don’t care about price action. Other traders want a methodology that is systematic and regular; I am as far removed from systematic and regular as it is possible to be.

- Camillo not only developed his own approach, he virtually invented an entirely different trading methodology.

- Question: What trading mistake did Camillo make in Jakks Pacific, the first trade for his hedge fund, in which his long call positions expired worthless? Think about it before reading on. Answer: Trick question. He didn’t make any mistake, and that is the point. Camillo followed his methodology precisely, and he placed a high-conviction trade—the type of trade that had a demonstrated history of strong net success. In this particular instance, a completely unforeseeable event—the total liquidation of a position by the company’s largest shareholder—caused the profit on the trade to be reversed in an instant. Sometimes, even the best-planned trade can fail. Such a trade will be a losing trade, but it is not a bad trade. On the contrary, if Camillo repeatedly takes such trades, he will come out way ahead, and it is impossible to tell a priori which of those trades will end up losing. The lesson is: Don’t confuse a losing trade with a bad trade—they are not necessarily the same thing. Losing trades can be good trades, and, similarly, winning trades can be bad trades.

- The trading portion of the portfolio consists mostly of very short-term trades and, to a lesser extent, longer-term short positions in the biotech sector. The inverse correlation derives from the fact that nearly three-quarters of the short-term trades, as well as the longer-term biotech positions, are shorts. Even the long positions in the trading portion of the portfolio are uncorrelated to the long equity investment holdings because they are day trades tied to company-specific events. By combining two inversely correlated segments, Kean is able to extract the long-term appreciation in equities without the typical downside exposure of long equity portfolios in bear markets. Kean’s unique method for hedging his long equity exposure, which relies heavily on shorting biotech stocks, is not applicable or advisable for most traders. However, it is not the specific method that Kean uses to reduce portfolio risk that is pertinent to readers. Instead, it is the concept of seeking uncorrelated and, preferably, inversely correlated positions that is important. Traders need to not only focus on their trades but also pay attention to how these trades combine in a portfolio.

- Krejčí has the distinction of having by far the smallest account of anyone ever included in a Market Wizards book. His trading account has generally ranged between $50,000 and $80,000. Krejčí trades only stocks with extremely high volume, so his methodology could easily be applied to a much larger portfolio. Given the liquidity of the stocks he trades and his exceptional performance, why is his account size so small? The answer is straightforward: Krejčí uses his trading profits to pay for living expenses. So, although his returns have been consistently excellent, he has never been able to build his account size. I interviewed Krejčí during the 2020 pandemic, which ruled out travel and a personal meeting. So our “meeting” was via Zoom.

- I looked for stocks that moved a lot in one day. I looked at stock charts back to 1997, and I noticed that for many stocks there were four times a year when there was a particularly big daily move. At first, I wondered why that happened. Then I found out that these price moves were caused by earnings reports. I discovered similarities in the price action in stocks the day after earnings that held as far back as I had data, which was 1997. Since you are trading just on earnings reports, I assume most of your trading is concentrated in a minority of trading days. Yes, most of my trades occur in the approximate month-long period each quarter in which most earnings reports are released. Some earnings reports are released outside of these periods. So I would say my year breaks down as four months in which I make most of my trades, three months of lighter trading, and five months when I focus on research. What kind of research do you do? I review my previous trades to see how I could have done better. For example, I try to answer questions such as: Would I have done better if I held the trade longer? You do that trade research manually? Yes, manually. I would say my job is 95% analyst and 5% trader. I am not a frequent trader. I have to see a high-percentage opportunity before I take a trade.

But the pre-open market action in the stock is one of the most important things I watch. I also pay particular attention to the commentaries and the revised targets by the analysts following the stock. I keep a notebook of what all the analysts have said in the past about a stock. What were their past price targets? How have they changed their price targets? What are they saying now compared to what they said three years ago? How did the stock respond to analyst upgrades and downgrades in the past? There is a saying that the analysts are always wrong.

What would happen if you had a year where you didn’t make any money? If I didn’t make any money for one year, I could survive. If I didn’t make any money for two years, I would have to quit.

Years ago, when I searched for what I could do, I knew I wanted to find something where the success or failure would depend only on me, not my colleagues, my boss, or anybody else.

- 6. Know Your Edge If you don’t know what your edge is, you don’t have one. Knowing your edge is critical to identifying which trades to focus on. For example, with the aid of his detailed trading journal, Dhaliwal was able to study the characteristics of his big wins. He discovered these trades shared multiple common denominators: the presence of an unexpected market event, harmony between his short-term and long-term views, and a tendency for the trade to work immediately. An awareness of the type of trades that accounted for the bulk of his gains—that is, understanding his edge—was an essential component of Dhaliwal’s stellar performance. As Dhaliwal advises, “Stay in the sphere of your edge by playing your game and not someone else’s.” 7. Learn from Your Mistakes Learning from mistakes is how traders improve. Perhaps the most valuable benefit of a trading journal is that it greatly facilitates the identification of trading errors. Reviewing such a journal periodically can remind the trader of past mistakes and, in so doing, reduce the repetition of the same mistakes. Sall used his journal to identify a mistake he was making after winning periods. He noticed that he was continually taking subpar trades after highly profitable periods. He realized that because he came from a working-class background, these subpar trades were an act of self-sabotage to bring him “back down to earth.” Once he recognized the problem, he was able to avoid repeating it. As another example of a trader identifying a mistake through his trading journal, Dhaliwal noticed that emotional disharmony he was feeling could be traced to trades where he had a conflict between his short-term and long-term views. When he had a longer-term trade on but saw an opportunity for a short-term trade in the opposite direction, Dhaliwal would end up trading neither view effectively. Once he recognized the source of his trading error, he solved the problem by separating the two conflicting trades. He would leave the long-term trade on, and then trade the short-term opportunity separately. ([Location 5906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=5906))

- Risk management at the portfolio level—Limiting the loss on individual trades is critical, but it is not sufficient for adequate risk control. Traders also need to be concerned about correlation between their positions. If different positions are significantly correlated, then the portfolio risk may be unacceptably high, even if every position has stop protection, because different trades will tend to lose money together.

- To recast an old joke, two congregants at a synagogue have had the same running argument for years. Dave contends that markets are efficient and that it is impossible for anyone to beat the markets other than by chance. Sam asserts that trading opportunities exist, and market outperformance is achievable. Finally, after years of fruitless bickering, they agree to let the rabbi decide who is right.

- They arrange to meet with the rabbi, explaining they would like him to settle a dispute. When they arrive at the rabbi’s home, he tells them he will speak with them one at a time in his office. Dave enters the rabbi’s office first. “I hope you don’t mind my wife being here,” the rabbi says, “but she takes notes for me.” Dave assures the rabbi that is fine and begins to explain his side of the argument. “I believe that the markets are efficient—a contention supported by thousands of academic papers. And it is not just a theoretical argument. Empirical studies repeatedly demonstrate that individual investors who make timing decisions do significantly worse than passive index funds. Even professional managers, on average, consistently do worse than the market. In light of all this evidence, trading is a fool’s game. People would be much better off just putting their money in index funds.” The rabbi, who has been listening intently, simply says, “You’re right.” Dave smiles smugly, quite content with the conversation outcome, and leaves the rabbi’s office. Sam walks in next. After the same preliminary formalities, he presents his side of the argument. He begins with a lengthy explanation of the myriad flaws in the efficient market hypothesis.22 He then says, “Also, rabbi, you know that I earn my living as a trader. I have a nice home. My family is well cared for. My generous annual contributions to the synagogue come from my trading profits. Clearly, it is entirely possible to profit handsomely from trading.” The rabbi, who has paid close attention, replies, “You’re right.” Sam smiles with satisfaction and walks out of the rabbi’s office. Once they are alone, the rabbi’s wife turns to him and says, “Dearest husband, I know you are a wise man, but how can they possibly both be right?” “You’re right,” replies the rabbi. Except, the rabbi’s wife is not right. Both Dave and Sam are right but in different contexts. The world of traders (or investors) can be divided into two categories: those who possess a methodology with an edge and those who do not. The second category is far larger than the first. Market participants who do not have any special skill in trading or investing—a group that includes most people—would be better off investing in index funds than in trying to make their own market decisions. So, ironically, although I do not believe the efficient market hypothesis is valid, I think most people would be best off behaving as if the theory were entirely accurate—a conclusion that would support the idea of index investing. This is the context in which Dave is right. However, there is a big difference between difficult and impossible. The magnitude by which the traders in this book outperformed market benchmarks over long periods (typically, decade-plus) cannot simply be explained away as “luck.” This is the context in which Sam is right. If there is one message in this book about the possibility of trading success, it is: It can be done! However,… ([Location 6263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08C59JPVW&location=6263))
