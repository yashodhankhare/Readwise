## Highlights
- Know When to Sell By 2012 our investments in the New Winners of the early 2000s and in the Class of 2008 had reached valuations that we could not rationally justify. P/E ratios on some of our companies climbed in excess of 30. When the whole world wants what you own and is willing to pay a price you would not pay, it is probably time to sell. We sold. Jon Bush had first labeled it “Tomorrow’s Price Today.” So it was that in late 2012, Overlook ([Location 2841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=2841))

- The Art of Selling Equities Contributed by James Squire The best way to manage risk is to understand what you are investing in. — Old Wall Street saying Biography of James Squire In the 1990s in Hong Kong, James was often the only other foreigner at the earnings announcements of many of my favorite companies and his presence frankly pissed me off. This was my territory. We would subtly ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3059))

- acknowledge each other’s existence without talking. That is when I learned James is nearly as competitive as me. Then we were introduced to each other and we realized each of us would be stronger working together. We had different backgrounds and education but shared a natural commitment to the fundamental principles that now comprise The Overlook Model. I knew James was right for Overlook on a taxi ride into Seoul from Incheon Airport. For over an hour, we traded stories of Korean companies that we had both owned in the early 1990s. These included: Baik Yang, an underwear manufacturer; Suheung, gelatin capsule manufacturer; Korea Explosives, a property play; Heung-A Shipping, a bankrupt shipping company that traded on the Rehabilitation Board; and a Korean hair dye company for men, the name of which we have both forgotten, but both owned. This is just the start of ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3065))

- the names we laughed about. It was a comedy of mistakes and frustrations. It has been my great privilege to work alongside James, Overlook’s Chief Investment Officer, these past 14 years. When I asked my Partners to write a chapter, it was natural that James would discuss the Art of Selling Equities. James is the best seller of securities I have ever witnessed. This is a chapter loaded with insights and lessons. The Art of Selling Equities Most investors concur that selling is the hard part of investing. There is always a clear reason to buy: because the shares appear cheap. The hard part starts once an investment has gone up. Questions as to why,… ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3073))

- report, Richard wrote about The Art of Selling Equities. In life, truths, ethics, and values remain fundamentally unchanged; but one’s understanding of these qualities and insights may evolve with experience and standing in a changing world. With that in mind, here we provide an updated commentary on selling equities: the five reasons to sell become six, and we more deeply explore our thoughts related to Tomorrow’s Price Today. Early Experience My early history of managing money in Asia is littered with examples of selling good investments too early. A name that left me with a scar is Johnson Electric. It is a blue-chip Hong Kong manufacturer making micro motors. During my stint in Japan… ([Location 3081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3081))

- then sold three years later at HK$ 21, feeling chuffed. The stock continued to rally strongly before finally peaking in June 2000 at over HK$ 50. Perhaps my most shameful multiple mistakes around a single name relate to Techtronic Industries, another Hong Kong manufacturer. It was a micro-cap when we invested in it in mid-1999 at under HK$ 0.5. I remember its founder, Horst Pudwill, coming into our office and excitedly showing me the multiple uses of their new Stanley knife before managing to cut himself with its blade. We sold it in June 2002 at HK$ 2.60 for a nice gain. Inexplicably, we failed to continue to follow it. When an opportunity to reinvest in it at HK$ 5.4 emerged in early 2010 after a stumble, we were unprepared, swung and missed. The market later presented another buying opportunity in 2016, with the same… ([Location 3089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3089))

- Electric and Techtronic Industries, but left far greater amounts on the table. My excuse? We were unable to monitor their corporate developments closely enough because our portfolio was too diverse; and our surprise at the size of the gains encouraged our timidity at a time when bravery and understanding would have served us well. I did not fully comprehend the real power of long-term investing until I took refuge under Overlook’s umbrella. Since then we have become a little better at holding on to our winners and letting go of the less capable investments. A final confession – I have also found myself selling positions too late. Little is as depressing as selling a stock knowing it has passed its sell-by date. This increases the likelihood of treating it as gum on one’s shoe and then getting rid of… ([Location 3097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3097))

- exit is to think about an investment’s duration. Understanding the Investment: Duration Two of our favorite sayings at Overlook are: “You don’t really know a stock until you own it,” and “The best way to manage risk is by understanding what you are investing in.” Before we initiate any new position, we write an investment thesis stating its opportunities and risks. In doing so, the investment is categorized, in Overlook terminology, into one of the following groups: Tier 1, 2, 3 Superior Cyclicals Defensives Financials For practitioners of this system, a… ([Location 3104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3104))

- A comment about the “investment pace” at Overlook needs to be made. Our mantra is: “400/40/4.” This refers to analysts meeting 400 companies a year, to make 40 significant pieces of research a year, for the investment committee to make four to five investments a year. As Overlook typically owns 20 to 24 stocks, the pace assumes the portfolio will be turned over approximately every four years, as indeed has been the case. Naturally, this influences duration and focuses our efforts on investing for the long term. Six Reasons to Sell There are six main reasons for fund managers to sell their holdings. We have listed… ([Location 3115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3115))

- portfolio Rebalancing Changing Investment Thesis Tomorrow’s Price Today We will now look at each of these more closely. 1. Acquisitions Corporate activity in Asia tends to be less frenetic than in the Western markets. Ownership structures, security laws, legal recourse, and the way of doing business all combine to make Asia’s mergers and acquisitions transactions relatively infrequent. When and where they do occur, minority shareholders are poorly protected. Consequently, Overlook avoids names linked to the potential for such activity. Since 2007, on only five occasions has Overlook been forced to sell a… ([Location 3123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3123))

- but in markedly different forms from the entities we had previously owned. Two stocks, Unisteel and ARA, were purchased by private equity sponsored deals, leaving only Phoenixtec Power, listed in Taiwan, as a bona fide acquisition by a corporate. 2. Mistakes Mistakes, in our experience, are more usually about people than businesses. Recognizing one has misjudged a company’s management is not easy. The desire to give management the benefit of the doubt is strong. We constantly remind ourselves that we cannot do a good deal with a bad person, yet still we make mistakes. This is both infuriating and belittling. Here are two examples of mistakes in which good businesses were neutered by management. Daekyo is a leading education company… ([Location 3133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3133))

The Global Financial Crises rolled through, the bank’s financial holding halved, and online education took off. Its price today remains below where it was when we sold. Qunxing Paper, listed in Hong Kong, was owned by a Chinese entrepreneur, Dr. Zhu. The decorative paper operations generated fabulous returns and abundant free cash flows. It was Dr. Zhu’s other interests, wind farms, which became the issue. They had inferior economics and he wished to inject these assets into our listed company. Fortunately, Overlook’s 4.8% stake was sufficient to block the transaction at the EGM. Then, by some miracle, a small rights issue provided sufficient liquidity for… ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3141))

- the doctorate that initially alerted us to concerns about his integrity. 3. More Ideas than Space in the Portfolio The hypothetical “red-headed stepchild” analogy comes to mind in thinking about times when the investment team has more good ideas than we have space for in the fund. Of course, we hold dear all of our investments. We would like to say we love them equally, but that cannot be the case since they are sized differently. When a clearly superior proposition is discovered, a weaker holding is always found and makes way for our new love. How does one know a superior investment has been found? The simplest way is to compare the new idea’s investment characteristics to that of the existing portfolio. A level deeper is to compare it… ([Location 3148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3148))

- greater satisfaction to the investment committee at Overlook than when we realize we can upgrade the portfolio through a stock forcing its way in. We have yet to shed tears for any outgoing name. 4. Rebalancing There are various aspects to consider when discussing rebalancing. At Overlook, we start with the premise that we are more likely to make money when we are sitting on our hands rather than trading feverishly, much to the annoyance of our brokers. Unlike many fund managers, trading around positions is a minor part of what we do. Rather, it is the importance of understanding each investment’s duration – through “tiering” – that helps to construct an appropriate trading plan. Rebalancing is best understood… ([Location 3156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3156))

- cautious about reducing our winners as we recognize investment returns are typically derived from relatively few stocks. Rebalancing can be a simple acknowledgement that the future is uncertain. Qihoo in 2013/14 is one such example, where we top sliced on a few occasions. The mid-year results unexpectedly disappointed, which led to price weakness. These were followed by a somewhat disappointing tender offer to take the company private. The delisting was convoluted and not completed until mid-2016. During the interim, the stock traded 25% lower from where we had sold some two years earlier. Rebalancing is often a cathartic experience. Overlook found this to be the case with CP All over 2012/13. Rebalancing allows one to make the initial decision to… ([Location 3164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3164))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- An aspect that is often overlooked is that rebalancing encourages investors to hold on to positions longer. The process of appropriately sizing permits holding the stock longer, enabling larger gains over longer periods. Our investment in TSMC, held for 20 years and counting, is a good example of this. We have taken money off the table and have added back, but if not for rebalancing, we probably would have sold our entire position. Failing to rebalance would have initially delivered higher profits to the Overlook investors, but over the long term, substantially smaller profits as the stock has risen to heights we never anticipated. 5. Changing Investment Thesis Before every investment is made, the stock lead on the idea writes an Investment Thesis paper. The document is just one page and presents a clear case for the investment. The focus is secular rather than cyclical and, thus, broad rather than narrow. ([Location 3172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3172))

- The idea is to keep us honest. If we are correct, wonderful. But if the share rallies for reasons that we had not anticipated, it is just that lady luck has been kind to us. We do not change the narrative to align with the outcome. Drifting from the thesis is a reason to sell. Thesis drift largely occurs from one of three sources: A low probability event taking place : Investment theses under the section “Key Risks” will include a description of possible long-tail risks that have a low probability of occurrence. The investment decision might be good, but if the event is triggered, the outcome becomes bad, or rather, unlucky. We trip over such situations from time to time. A recent example is Beijing Shanghai High Speed Railway in early 2020, where the steady, irreplaceable asset’s defensive operations were eviscerated by the outbreak of COVID. Fortunately, we had already sold. ([Location 3179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3179))

- A change in strategy : Corporates are living entities and so change through time. These changes are not always for the better, as we have discovered to our woes. Our attempts to remain close with management are targeted to ensure that we are not taken by surprise by the launch of a new business arm, or alike. Our clear preference is for simple, focused businesses, so it was a great disappointment when Kingboard Chemical Holdings in 2010 decided to diversify into properties at the listed level rather than keeping these interests private. Within a year we had sold out, ending a decade of wonderful partnership with Kingboard. A poor corporate transaction : Little shocks us as… ([Location 3187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3187))

- of the news. CP All’s acquisition of Siam Makro in April 2013 is seared in my memory as one such example. Here, a top dollar valuation was paid for a business that CP Group had been forced to sell during the Asian Crisis. It took the company from a net cash position to net debt/EBITDA of 4.5x! Furthermore, it was Overlook’s largest holding at the time and had previously graduated from Overlook’s Modern Finance Technology class. The lesson is that surprises arise despite the best laid plans. Reacting appropriately is critical. More often than not, I have found it right to follow my late mother’s advice: “A stitch in time saves nine.” 6.… ([Location 3194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3194))

- good reasons not to sell – such as the item is irreplaceable, or it has great sentimental value. With regards to equities, we view Tomorrow’s Price as when the market is discounting too far into the future: at least two years, but not unusually three years or more. When one is getting tomorrow’s price today, greed frequently trumps reason, preventing the would-be seller from transacting. The desire to hold on for more subdues rational thought. The price that was previously acceptable is no longer. In my experience, residential property vendors best exhibit this kind of irrational seller behavior. There are times when a market can be speculatively and wildly overvalued. Such examples include Wall Street in 1929, 2000 and 2008; or China in 2007 and 2015. Such occasions generally end in… ([Location 3201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3201))

- Keynes noted, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” Moreover, at Overlook we joke internally that we have predicted eight of the last two market crashes. Overlook sees underperforming the later stages of a bull market as a badge of honor. At such times, the wrong people are making quick money. Real money, we believe, is made slowly. The most speculative stocks do well at peaks. Since we take great care and pride in not overpaying, it is almost impossible for us to outperform at such times. This helps to explain the Overlook investors’ underperformance in 2007 when we had sold out of China and the market was raging. However, we were more than able to recover the underperformance… ([Location 3209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3209))

- “Understanding the Investment: Duration,” we touched upon the importance of categorization. We will now discuss the mental models we use for the Tier 3, Superior Cyclicals, and Tier 1 categories, since they represent the basic spectrum of how we approach selling. Tier 3 Tier 3 businesses are what Warren Buffett would describe as “cigar butts.” These businesses are our least favored type of investment and rarely account for more than 6% of the book (one to two positions). Our approach here is to buy them very cheaply and expect to sell them cheaply with the knowledge that time is working against the… ([Location 3217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3217))

- You Superior Cyclicals Superior Cyclicals are those companies that generate high operating returns and require limited fixed asset and working capital investment, but are cyclical in nature. Consequently, this group tends to carry lower multiples than stocks with similar investment returns that are more stable. The earnings volatility provides the opportunity, but investors need to avoid buying at the wrong part of the cycle. 10–25% of the book (three to six positions) is invested in such names. For Superior… ([Location 3224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3224))

Superior Cyclical – Earnings Power Critical The classic Overlook Superior Cyclical example is Top Glove, the world’s top manufacturer of latex rubber gloves, listed in Malaysia. The company is run by the very capable Tan Sri Dato’ Lee Shin-cheng, and Malaysia has a competitive advantage in sourcing latex due its extensive rubber plantations. Overlook took an outsized position in 2004. We understood that… ([Location 3231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3231))

- demand was high but rubber prices were low, windfall profits were made. Such circumstances arose in 2010; so, when the market discounted the current margins into perpetuity, we took advantage and sold, having made three and a half times our initial cost. ASM Pacific, another Superior Cyclical, has the accolade of being sold and repurchased four times – more than any other stock in Overlook’s history – generating a combined IRR of 117.9%. It makes back-end testing equipment that is tied closely to the semiconductor industry. Cutting to the chase, we have conviction around the earnings power – the earnings per share the company can generate – of ASM’s operations. This enables us to value the business in a downturn when the market is… ([Location 3238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3238))

Characteristically, they enjoy exceptionally high returns; have low capital intensity, strong pricing power, and defensible moats; and are cash generative. One needs to be wary of selling such gems, since their duration is infinity. The catch is that few companies are ranked Tier 1. We seek Tier 1 to occupy as large a portion of the book as possible.

- overvaluation. Selling out with the idea of repurchasing rarely happens, as the market recognizes the value and is not prepared to offer the stock at a discount. Therefore, the best one can hope for is to buy these great businesses at fair value and sit with them, allowing for the magic of compounding. Tier 1 businesses Overlook has written about over the years include Unilever Indonesia, TSMC and NetEase, to name a few. A caveat to remember is that companies can transition between tiers, more often down than up. This is often the reason behind exiting Tier 1 names. Recognizing the change is often the reason to sell. The reasons behind the change are manifold but include a quantum… ([Location 3253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3253))

With insights, an appropriate exit strategy can be constructed. Overlook’s tiering system guides as to the likely manner of the sale. Accordingly, we have made this a component of The Overlook Model. We should not give the impression that the approach is infallible. We believe it nudges the odds in our favor. As much as possible, we avoid looking back at what was left on the table. We are aware that one cannot catch the top of… ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3KFV6H&location=3261))
