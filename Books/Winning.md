## Highlights
- Winning is the ultimate gamble on yourself. The difference between dreaming about what could be, and actually living it. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=63))

- Winning never lies, but it always hides the truth. It tells you everything you want is so close, and then laughs as it slams the door in your face. It tells you all your goals and dreams are impossible, and then taunts you to keep going. One more step. One more step. One more step, to an uncertain destination that might not even be there. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=65))

- Winning is unapologetic. You can be replaced. You will be replaced. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=76))

- I know it’s common in books like this for the “experts” to give you “steps.” Five Easy Steps! Ten Secret Steps! Twenty Steps I Just Made Up for This Book! Seriously? You can’t buy a map to the top. If you could, everyone would be up there. They’re not. The steps to Winning are infinite, and constantly shifting. One minute you see a step in front of you, the next moment it’s quicksand. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=77))

- Most people don’t see that step disappear until it’s too late. They get sucked into the quicksand, and give up. Winning doesn’t care if you can walk up the steps—anyone can do that. It wants to know what happens when you miss that step, when you can’t see or feel what’s in front of you. When you have to trust yourself and believe what you feel, not what you see. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=80))

- Winning requires you to be different, and different scares people. So if you’re worried about what others will say, the long-term effects, the sacrifices you’ll make, the sleep you’ll lose, your family being angry… I can’t help you with that. There’s nothing “typical” about the lifestyle and choices you’ll have to make. Winning is inside all of us, but for most, that’s where it will stay, trapped under a lifetime of fear and worry and doubt.

- Winning will do everything possible to keep you from catching it, but if you do, if you earn a seat at that magnificent table and you’re finally included in the conversation, be prepared for two things: (1) Winning will give you the chair with one broken leg so you can never get comfortable, and (2) you’d better be able to speak its language. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=156))

- When you start apologizing for who you are, you stop growing and you stop winning. Permanently. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=214))

- There are 13. If you read Relentless, you may recall that I like to use the number 13, because I don’t believe in luck. Neither does Winning. Winning believes in Winning. You may also recall that everything on my lists is ranked #1, because when you start ranking things, 1-2-3-4-etc., people think #1 is most important, #2 is less important, and everything else is just there to fill out the list. So we go with #1 for everything, and you can read them in any order. THE WINNING 13 #1. WINNING makes you different, and different scares people. #1. WINNING wages war on the battlefield in your mind. #1. WINNING is the ultimate gamble on yourself. #1. WINNING isn’t heartless, but you’ll use your heart less. #1. WINNING belongs to them, and it’s your job to take it. #1. WINNING wants all of you; there is no balance. #1. WINNING is selfish. #1. WINNING takes you through hell. And if you quit, that’s where you’ll stay. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=240))

- #1. WINNING is a test with no correct answers. #1. WINNING knows all your secrets. #1. WINNING never lies. #1. WINNING is not a marathon, it’s a sprint with no finish line. #1. WINNING is everything. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=250))

- Stop being afraid of what you’ll become. You should be more afraid of not becoming that. If you can’t buy into this, if you believe you’re not ready or not deserving, if you’re not willing to commit to your own success, you’ve never won, and you probably won’t. Because winners all understand one thing: There’s a price to pay, and you must pay it. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=255))

- If you think like everyone else, if you act like everyone else, if you follow the same protocols and traditions and habits like everyone else, guess what: You’ll be like everyone else. Everyone wanted to be like Mike. Mike did not want to be like anyone else. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=271))

- It was never about being different for the sake of being different, or generating publicity, or trying to look clever and progressive. It was about understanding the difference between knowing how to think, and being told what to think. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=281))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- That whole BS about thinking outside the box is just that: BS. Winners don’t see the box. They see possibilities. They use their own decisions, successes, and failures as a springboard to elevate their thinking and results. Every great creation and invention started with people who knew how to think and didn’t allow themselves to be told what to think. If you want to get to the elite level, this is what sets you apart. If you follow the textbook exactly, if you always do it the “normal” way, you can be very good at what you do. But what happens when there’s a glitch or an unforeseeable issue that the textbook didn’t cover? How do you manage when nothing is “normal”? People love to talk about “pivoting” in hard times—making a fast shift in a different direction—but you have to pivot and move toward something, you can’t keep changing direction just to change direction. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=287))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And unless you know how to think for yourself, you’re just going to keep pivoting back and forth, this way and that way, waiting for someone to save you. Waiting to be told what to think. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=293))

- That’s the difference between competing and winning. I hear this all the time from my corporate clients: “We know how to compete. Now we need to learn how to win.” It’s not always the same thing. When you know what to think, you’re ready to compete. When you know how to think, you’re ready to win. Your education teaches you what to think. Life experience teaches you how to think. In school, you’re tested after you learn. In life, the test comes before you learn. Coaches and bosses tell you what to think. Doing the work tells you how to think.

- Everything I’ve done with my clients has been the result of helping them close the gap between being the best, and being the best ever. Big difference between those two. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=370))

- Your nonnegotiables have to be things you—and only you—can control. The food you eat. The effort you commit. The words you speak. The results you deliver. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=428))

- Because the one thing we’re not going to negotiate is anything that adversely impacts your performance. If you’re out until 5:00 a.m., if you had a lot to drink, if you smoke to relax, I’ll judge you by your results. Did you play like garbage the next day? We’re going to have a talk about what happened the night before. You played great? Remind me what you did the night before; we might need to do that again. I can’t remember all the times I trusted my own thinking and succeeded. But I can remember the times I ignored my own thoughts, did what I was told to do, and failed. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=442))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One of my nonnegotiable core values is trusting my instincts, and believing what I know. I might be wrong, but I want the chance to be right. And I’d rather decide for myself than allow others to decide for me. Winning does not negotiate. You won or you lost. It doesn’t care how hard you worked, it doesn’t care about extenuating circumstances that got in your way. You worked hard? That’s nice. I need someone who works hard, smart, fast, and a whole mess of other things. Get back in line and figure it out. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=459))

- Figure it out. Put your craziness to work. Innovate, don’t imitate. And above all, stop listening to everyone who tells you what to think. If they knew, they’d all be winners. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=463))

- Note: Get the results, and the brand will build itself. Play it the other way around, and your career will be dead long before your shoe deal expires. That’s how you sabotage yourself. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=535))

- If you’re procrastinating, if you’re constantly apologizing for things you did and didn’t do, if you get to the end of the day and realize you didn’t accomplish a single thing you wanted—or needed—to do, you’re distracted by your own thoughts. We all have some kind of “To Do” list, but for most, it’s a “Things to Do That Will Never Get Done” list. Winners have a “Done” list.

- To me, routines are freedom, if you use them correctly. They allow you to take action with certainty and purpose; they remove the variables and speed bumps that slow you down. And most important, they bypass the battlefield decisions: Should I? Should I not? This way? That way? Today? ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=564))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Tomorrow? How long? Who should I ask? When you have a well-planned routine, those questions have already been answered. You execute and move on. Done. Next. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=566))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- can think clearly. You get updates for your computer and your phone; how often do you update your ideas? Your strategies? Your priorities? How often do you reboot your mental energy and delete the outdated programs and files? Action originates in your thoughts. Winning will pull you in one direction, but your mind will pull you back: It’s too tough. I didn’t expect this. I’m not ready. I’m not good enough. Are you confident enough in yourself to win that battle? Are you ready to gamble on yourself to win? We’re about to find out.

- Over the years, numerous players had asked MJ if they could use me to train them during the season, and always got his standard response: I don’t pay him to train me; I pay him not to train anyone else. But at this point, he was already retired, and he genuinely wanted to see Kobe play at the highest level for as long as he could.

- Not so he could become MJ. So he could become a better Kobe. Most players who have asked me about MJ over the years are looking for ways to copy his mentality and his game, which can’t be done. I can list all the traits and habits and philosophies that made him great, but the secret is in how they’re put together, and that’s unique to every individual. You can take every ingredient in Coca-Cola—they’re listed right on the can—and combine them in a thousand different ways, but you’ll never be able to replicate Coca-Cola, because it’s not about the ingredients, it’s about the formula for combining those ingredients. When you’re iconic, you can never be duplicated. Kobe understood that. He wanted to learn, so he could implement certain things that would work for him, and continue to elevate his own game. Because when you’re already that good, ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=664))

- there aren’t many people who can show you how to get better. I’m often asked about the differences and similarities between the two. I don’t like to compare, because to me they were so different and unique that it’s an injustice to both. But if you want a basic summary, I’ll give you this: Kobe worked harder. MJ worked smarter. Kobe never stopped. He questioned me about every aspect of our training; he needed to know why and how everything worked. He didn’t always want to be there—What we got left?—but he always did the work, and he always came back for more. He was insatiable for game film. He’d watch a play over and over and over, processing what happened and how he could make it happen better. He carried a DVD player everywhere—this was before iPads—so he could watch special videos made for him by the team. When that wasn’t enough, we brought in my director of player development, Mike Procopio, to break down film on every game and every opponent, studying and strategizing for every possible scenario. From 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., that was Kobe’s focus… unless he was in the gym putting up shots. If there was an open gym at 3:00 a.m. and he wanted to work on something, he’d be in that gym. I never slept during those years, I just napped, because you never knew when he’d be ready to get back to work. We’d be on the court at 3:00 a.m., and by 4:30, I’d make him leave so he could get some rest. But I’d stay… because I knew he’d sneak back in fifteen minutes, and I’d have to make him leave all over again. Of all the things we worked on, the most challenging was simply getting him to stop. In athletic performance, everything is about go-go-go and up-up-up, with not enough time and attention paid to STOP. Winning needs you ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=671))

- to occasionally stop, land, listen, see, smell, learn, understand. If all you can do is go, you will eventually run right past Winning and not even recognize it. MJ knew when to stop. He processed things so quickly that he didn’t need to study as long and hard; he just knew. He’d look at film but usually just to confirm what he’d already replayed in his mind. His head was like an infinite library of images and… ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=684))

- But Winning is an addiction like none other, and once it shows you some unforgiving love, you’ll crave that love forever. It was no different for Kobe. Everything he did was about his massive belief in himself, starting with his decision to skip college and go right into the NBA. He won three championships alongside Shaq, and then spent the rest of his ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=721))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- career proving to himself he could win without Shaq—twice. He learned five languages, including Mandarin Chinese (because he knew the NBA was going to be huge in China) and Slovenian, so he could trash-talk Luka Dončić from the sidelines. He’d speak to Lakers teammate Pau Gasol in Spanish, so none of the opposing players knew what they were going to do. He played through injuries that would have destroyed most players, rupturing his Achilles but staying on the floor long enough to make two free throws, and then asking if there was a way to just “tape it up” so he could keep going.

- Confidence is your ticket to freedom, your escape route from everything that’s holding you back. Bad relationships, bad decisions, bad situations… the people and issues that stand between you and what you want.

- I’ve learned over the years that if you want to make people emotional, you should talk about their emotions. I did exactly that in my book Relentless and got a lot of people very upset with me. I was talking about getting in the Zone during competition and performance, controlling the uncontrollable, and I wrote: “Emotions make you weak.” I won’t repeat the whole discussion here, you can read it yourself, but here was the point: The Zone is about calmness and clarity. Emotions are the complete opposite. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=903))

- It’s true. The more emotional you get, the more you have to deal with those feelings instead of just focusing on what you’re doing. People weren’t happy. I heard from parents who told me kids need to be able to show emotion. I heard from psychologists who said this is what’s wrong with society, everyone is afraid to show emotion. I heard from coaches who said they want their teams playing with emotion. Folks: I’m not against emotion. We are not robots. I want you to laugh and cry and be happy and sad and happy again. Just not all at the same time, especially while you’re trying to win. To the coaches, I will add this: Stop telling your teams to play with emotion. Emotions are volatile and unpredictable and erratic, especially when you have multiple emotions bubbling up at the same time. You don’t want them playing with emotion. You want them playing with energy. Huge difference. Go ahead and tell a team you want to see emotion. What does that mean, exactly, to each individual? Which emotions do you want to see? You want them to laugh? Cry? Curl up and be scared? Do you want to see joy in the middle of the game while you’re losing? Sadness? Fear? Confusion? Hurt? Embarrassment? You really want any of those in your game? Those are all emotions. None are going to help you win. You want energy. Focus. Intensity. You want to be alert and aggressive and strong.

And if you’re going to play with emotion—because it works for you and you have the results to prove it—then make sure you’re playing with one emotion, steady and consistent. Take the roller-coaster highs and lows out of it. You must remain steady and focused regardless of how you feel. Your mind must remain stronger than your feelings. After you win, or lose, there’s plenty of time to be emotional about whatever happened. But during competition, the only thing you should feel is total control. It’s your responsibility to demand that of yourself. Not easy, I know. Every day, Winning does its best to mess around with your mind and feelings, just to throw you off course. Your mind makes decisions. Feelings ask, Really? You sure about that?? Your mind tells you to get to the gym. Feelings say, Stay in bed. One day won’t matter. Your mind deals with pain by finding ways to stop hurting. Feelings thrive on being hurt. Your mind counters the disappointment of failure with the knowledge that it’s possible to try again.

- is: deciding which part of you gets a vote. Some days, frustration might have something to say. Weakness might overpower you. You might give in to jealousy, or laziness, or fear. It happens. Everyone has lapses, we all lose control at some point. But not every day. The skeletons in your mental closet do not get a vote every day. Put those hands down. Staying in control of yourself is a choice. Losing control is a choice. But to develop that level of control you have to understand what’s dictating your actions, and your thoughts. Is it you? Is it something external? Are you so busy fighting with everyone else that you don’t even realize your biggest battle is with yourself? Self-control means facing the things you don’t want to face, looking for answers in yourself and not others, knowing you’re not always going to be happy or secure. It means resisting the celebration every time something good happens, and not falling apart every time things don’t go your way. It’s about managing the low moments, the setbacks, and not getting caught up in things you shouldn’t—the things that test you. What happens when you’re faced with a situation that challenges you? You have your initial emotional reaction—unhappiness or fear or anxiety, or whatever you’re feeling—and then you get the inevitable bonus waves of emotion as you think and think and think about it.

- head. Every voice you hear creates a different feeling and a different emotion, and it’s up to you to keep them all in line. If you react to everything someone says to you or about you, you’re always going to lose. You want the formula for this? I’ll make it easy for you: Control your thoughts, and you control your emotions. Control your emotions, and you control your actions. Control your actions, and you control the outcome. That’s it. Your thoughts create emotions. Your emotions drive your actions. Your actions determine the outcome. You have to know when to turn your heart off, and your mind on. You must be able to lose your way, and find your way back. Winning wants to see your return ticket, not a one-way trip on a runaway train to failure. If you’re in that gym with MJ, you can either feel the sting of his words and use them to elevate your performance, or you can feel the sting of his words and crumble. When control is taken from you, focus on the things you can control, instead of the things you can’t. That was the driving force behind MJ’s final run with the Bulls: Coach isn’t coming back, the team is being broken up, you’ve taken away our control over what happens next. I can’t argue with you about bringing… ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=947))

- The most common emotion I see in my athletes and top-tier business clients is anger, because they’re so driven and competitive. If that’s your fuel, if that’s what sets you on fire and launches you into the Zone where nothing can touch you, then you should use it. But as with all explosives, this fuel comes with a warning: “CAUTION: DO NOT USE WITHOUT EXTREME SKILLS, INTELLIGENCE, AND EXPERIENCE.” Performing with anger can work for you if (a) it’s your natural response to competition, and (b) you know how to control it. Otherwise, you’re going to lose control in the heat of the moment, without the ability to control what follows.

I challenge you to keep competing with the same confidence and commitment that has taken you this far. When others talk about your competitiveness like it’s a bad thing, remind yourself they can’t relate to how you feel, because they’ve never felt it. That’s their loss. It should not be yours. You can control those competitive urges. But why should you have to? Winning has no loyalty to you. No matter how long you’ve battled to become a winner, it takes one split second to become a loser. I know that’s a hard reality for a lot of people. They work so hard to get somewhere, and in an instant, it’s gone. They gave it up. Or more likely… someone took it.

- These are the people who won something—once—and never won anything again, because they were so content and overwhelmed by their one big win that they stopped competing for anything else. They still talk about their high school football championship, or the car they won in the sales contest seven years ago. Since then? Nothing. Still talking. Then there are the “winners” who finally reached their goals, got the big house, four cars, splashy vacations… and thought it would last forever. It doesn’t. Someone else watched what they did, and did it better. Winning loves to watch someone else kill your dream. You had a great month? Good for you. See you in thirty days. Someone will be there winning. It might not be you. And there are also those who love to compete for anything, anytime, but without any real focus or objective. They love the chase, but don’t invest the time or skills to catch what they’re chasing. So they go after everything, and never really get ahead in anything. But they’re “competitive.” Make a note: Being competitive and being a winner aren’t the same thing. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1074))

- But if you haven’t experienced this, if you feel like you’re not competitive enough, if you worry that there’s something missing in you, if you’re not seeing results… you need to hear this: The ability to compete is in all of us. You compete for something every minute of the day, with every decision you make. At the basic level, you compete with daily obstacles: Should I go to the gym? Should I skip this donut? Can I get out of the house on time? Will I get my work done today? That’s where it starts; if you can’t win at those things, you’re not going to win at anything else. If you’re trying to quit drinking, but every weekend you still go out for a drink, you lose every weekend. The right decisions take you to the next level, closer to Winning. The wrong decisions keep you exactly where you are. When you can win those small victories, you can start competing for more: I need to increase the intensity of my workout. I want to lose fifteen pounds. I’m going to get to the office early so I can get more done. I’m going to deliver more than I was asked to. Every day, you need to compete at a higher level than the day before. Small decisions. Little changes. New challenges. Bigger ambitions. You’re not going to make a million bucks or build your empire or win a championship in one day. You’re going to compete for it every day for infinite days. That’s how you become not just a competitor, but a true competitor: You get better every day for a long time. Not accidentally, but intentionally.

These are the “ride or die” partners who never ask why or how much; they already know, and they’ll take a bullet for the cause.

- You can’t have it all at the same time, and you’ll have to get used to the reality that certain things will have to wait. But what’s the first thing people do when they feel their life is unbalanced? They start adding. I should get a dog. I need to do more charity work. I have to help my friends move. I’m supposed to go to this party. Now they don’t have time for the one thing they really want, so they have to give up other things just to keep up. I’ll sleep less. I can get up at 3 a.m. I’ll work out before dawn. I’ll stay up extra late and work all night. I can get it all done. No, you can’t. You have to master the art of NO. “No” is a complete sentence, it requires no interpretation, and everyone around the globe understands what it means. They might not like what it means, but they understand it. And every time you say yes, every time you say maybe or not right now when you really want to say no, Winning rolls its eyes and looks at someone else. Why is it so hard to say no? I know, you want to help people, you want to be nice, you want to show that you can take on everything and make it all work. But Winning doesn’t need you to do any of those things.

Keep it in your phone, on your desk, tape it to the mirror, the refrigerator, and use it. Just making the list will give you a fresh perspective on what really matters, and what’s just cluttering up your schedule and your life. Stop adding. Start deleting. Winning demands total focus. Everything and everyone doesn’t merit equal time and attention. If you’re going to have more time for what you want, you’re going to have less time for the friends who need to fill you in on their daily life dramas, the group texts with thirty people who think it’s their job to entertain the group all day, the colleagues who love to have meetings that resolve nothing. “It’s important,” they say.

- You want an exercise on how to delete what you don’t need? Work with this: Everyone has this one muscle that’s essential to focusing, prioritizing, and ultimately winning. You can’t see it, you can’t show it off under your clothes. It’s internal: the IDGAF muscle. The medically correct term is the I Don’t Give a Fuck muscle. It’s stronger in some people than in others, and it gets stronger the more you use it. This is the muscle you flex when you need to make critical decisions about your life and your priorities, when others are telling you what to do, judging your decisions, and distracting you from your mission. You can also use it on yourself, when your fears and doubts are whispering—or screaming—that you’re not good enough and you don’t know what you’re doing. I hear you. Flex. And I don’t give a fuck. But you can’t just say it, you have to take real action based on a real decision. The first few times you use your IDGAF muscle, it may feel weak and sore and easily fatigued, as with any muscle you don’t use often enough. But when you use it regularly, and train it appropriately, it becomes strong, fast, and responsive. And that elevates your ability to separate from the things and people you need to move away from. This muscle should never be used in anger, or to make an emotional decision. This is about making a decision you’ve wanted to make for a long time, a decision you knew was right but for whatever reason you didn’t take action. You can use this muscle in almost every area of your life, but it’s an especially powerful tool in the area of balance. This is the muscle that gives you freedom. I won’t be at this event. I have another commitment. That doesn’t work for me. Not doing it.… ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1259))

They have no problem ending a business meeting after ninety seconds because they’ve heard enough. They don’t pretend to like an idea just to make others feel good. They never commit to anything unless they see a benefit to themselves or their goals. Their time and agenda is their top priority, and they don’t reach out to others unless they need to.

- I’m the youngest son of Indian parents who brought our family to the United States when I was four. Both of my parents worked in the medical field, and I was raised to understand that I had two choices for a career: I could be a doctor, or I could be a doctor. I chose neither. I wanted to work with professional athletes. “You’re going to what??” My parents grieved. “I’m going to work with professional athletes.” But to make them happy—because I genuinely wanted to make them happy, I just didn’t want to be a doctor—I agreed to apply to medical school, and I prayed I wouldn’t get in. I got in. Which led to one of the most difficult “selfish” moments of my life: telling my parents I wasn’t going to medical school, and wasn’t going to be a doctor. To say that they were disappointed would be a wild understatement, even though I went on to get my master’s degree in exercise science, and managed to have a decent career doing exactly what I said I would do: work with professional athletes.

Or if you can’t afford the jet, is it “wasteful” to join an airport lounge or fly first class, so you have some room to work while you travel? If your business involves driving colleagues to look at potential real estate investments, is it “flashy” to invest in a nice car so your passengers are comfortable? If you’re working remotely and conducting all your meetings and conferences online, shouldn’t you consider spending some money on quality equipment that allows you to look and sound professional? I’m always amazed when the media report on superstar athletes who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars—or more—on their training and health, as if that’s a crazy luxury. There’s a chef! And a masseuse! He’s got a whole gym and a basketball court in the house! Those aren’t luxuries, those are business partners. You’re talking about athletes with eight- or nine-figure incomes. You don’t think they should invest 1 percent of that to make sure they’re strong and healthy? To prolong their careers so they can keep making the kind of money that allows them to spend that kind of money? But let’s be clear on this: It’s not about how much money is being spent.

I have only one answer, regardless of whether you want to work with athletes or design skyscrapers or discover a planet: invest in your education and your skills. There are no shortcuts, there’s no fast track. Michael Jordan hired me because I presented him with a program that intrigued him, and then I backed it up with results. The years I spent investing in myself—learning, experimenting, developing a plan that would someday change the way athletes trained—allowed that to happen. It’s up to you to make that happen for yourself. If your family isn’t supportive, if they think you’re going to fail, if they’re telling you it’s too hard and too much and you’re making the biggest mistake of your life, you can either agree and live the life they’ve chosen for you, or you can take responsibility for yourself and find a way to live the life you want.

- When someone tells you they never feel nervous, or they have no fears, they’re either lying, or their challenges aren’t big enough. Everyone experiences fear. Everyone. I don’t care how brave and badass and “fearless” you imagine yourself to be; there’s something that strikes fear in your soul and makes your heart pound uncontrollably. Maybe just for a moment, maybe longer. You can’t prevent it. Fear is instinctive; we’re hardwired for it. Not just in sports or adventuring or intense competition, but in business and classrooms and every part of our lives. I know I don’t have to explain fear, you’ve experienced it a million times in your life—maybe you’re experiencing it right now. But we have to talk about it, because fear can give you direct access to Winning, if you know how to manage it.

- or panicked. But insecurity and panic aren’t the same as fear. They align more with anxiety, and your doubts about your ability to manage the fear. Fear and doubt aren’t the same, and the difference is as distinct as Winning and Losing. What do you fear? What are you afraid of that’s holding you back from what you really want? I’m sure you realize we’re not talking about spiders and tall buildings and clowns. We’re talking about the chaotic thoughts churning in your head at 2:00 a.m., when you so badly want to sleep but the noise in your mind won’t stop. Whatever you fear, do you face those challenges with the confidence that you can manage the outcome? Or do you doubt your ability to handle what’s coming your way? Fear versus doubt. Not the same thing. The greats quiet themselves by thinking about all the preparation they’ve put in, the confidence that they’ve done the work and they’re ready. My basketball clients played eighty-two regular-season games a year, and they felt nervous before every single one. Before every game, you’d see MJ alone, head down, chewing his gum, having a private conversation with himself. He felt the same nerves you might feel before you’re about to face a challenge. But he never doubted that he would perform at his best. Kobe felt it as well. “I have self-doubt,” he said in an interview. “I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I’m like, ‘My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don’t have it. I just want to chill.’ We all have self-doubt. You don’t deny it, but you also don’t capitulate to it. You embrace it.” You embrace it. You trust yourself to handle whatever you’re dealing with, and don’t allow your fear to escalate into uncontrollable doubt.

- Fear shows up on its own. Doubt has to be invited. Fear heightens your awareness; it makes you alert. Doubt is the opposite; it slows you down and paralyzes your thinking. Fear is about playing to win. Doubt is about playing to not lose. When you’re facing a big meeting or huge presentation or the game of a lifetime, fear is a flashing neon strobe that jolts you into action. Doubt tells you to freeze until the crisis has passed. Fear is about the threat, whatever you have to face. Doubt is about you. You might fear what the opposition could do. But if you doubt your ability to beat them, you have no chance. Fear tells you there’s a minute left on the clock, and you need to win now. Doubt tells you there’s a minute left on the clock, and you’re about to lose. Fear is pressure. Doubt is panic. Fear says I can do this. Doubt says I’m fucked. Of all the obstacles and challenges you’ll face on this race to greatness, none will define you more than how you react when you stand at the crossroads of fear and doubt. That’s Winning: a terrifying leap of belief in yourself. Winning takes you up in the plane and pushes you out the door before you can check once more to see if your parachute is harnessed.

- There are four components of Winning that determine how you’ll manage your fears and doubts and make that leap, or if you’ll make it at all. Talent. Intelligence. Competitiveness. Resilience. It’s possible to get a win with just three of these, and I suppose in very rare cases, you might be able to stumble into a win with just one or two, if a thousand other things are going in your favor at the same time. But to win at the highest level, over and over, in all areas of your life—career, finances, health, family, whatever else you value—you need all four. Very few people have all four. Picture a bull’s-eye. There’s a large ring on the outside, with a slightly smaller ring inside that one, and then an even smaller ring inside that one, and then in the very center, one more little ring. I call these the Four Rings of Winning. And in the dead center of these rings, there’s your target. In the large outer ring, you have talent. Everyone gets into this ring, because everyone has some degree of talent at something. Being in this group isn’t elite or remarkable; it’s just a starting point you can build on, because talent is never going to be enough to make you a consistent winner. Even if you’re extremely talented, there are still going to be others at your level, or close ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1753))

- to it, and if they have other abilities you don’t possess, you’ll be left behind. Inside that talent ring is a slightly smaller ring. To get into this ring, you need to bring your talent, and you’ll also need intelligence. You don’t have to be a genius on all topics, but you need extreme intelligence in whatever you’re striving to accomplish. The individuals in this ring know how to develop their talent, and they have a deep understanding of how to use it. So, for example, an NFL quarterback doesn’t need to understand how to perform a heart transplant, but he needs to be extremely smart about how to be an NFL quarterback. However: There are plenty of smart and talented people out there who have never achieved anything, so being in this ring isn’t necessarily going to guarantee a win. You’re going to need more. Now we move closer to the center of the target, into the next ring, where the population is even smaller. To get into this ring, you must have talent, intelligence, and the added element of competitiveness, because all the ability and smarts in the world can’t help you if you’re not able or willing to compete for what you want. If you’re in this ring, you understand nothing is going to be handed to you, no matter how good you are, and you’re committed to fighting for your end result. This is where a lot of people lose: They talk about competing, they say all the right things and truly believe them. They say they’ll “do anything”… until… ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1763))

- But you need one more thing to be a true winner. There’s one more ring, the smallest, with the fewest people and the greatest results. This tiny circle has all the other components—talent, intelligence, competitiveness—and adds the one thing that separates champions from everyone else: Resilience. Resilience is the power to stay in the fight when your fear is telling you to run. It’s the ability to see everything that can go wrong, and still get control of what can go right. When you’ve been blindsided by bad news, bad people, or bad fortune—when you have nothing to hold on to—resilience is your lifeline. Resilience is knowing that when everything goes from bad to worse, and you have every reason to fall apart, you don’t. It allows you to feel the pain and humiliation of loss and conflict and turmoil, and still believe you’ll survive. When your head is exploding under the pressure bearing down on you, when your guts are being torn apart by chaos and crisis, when you want to quit, when everyone wants you to quit, resilience is the dark drug that whispers to you: Keep going. Because you know you can. You must. When you have nothing to lose, you’re free to do anything. You know that uncomfortable jittery feeling of “butterflies” in the stomach? That’s resilience,… ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1777))

- Resilience is what separates fear and doubt. It allows you to be on high alert, but still remain in control of your decisions and actions. Resilient people don’t act like victims, they don’t feel sorry for themselves. They’re not dwelling on what’s happening right now, they’re looking ahead to see how they can take control and change the outcome. If they don’t like the way their story is unfolding, they write their own. There’s not a single day of your life that doesn’t require some kind of resilience.

- People love to brag about how they hate to lose, how they’re terrible losers, as if somehow that makes them winners. Guess what, everyone hates to lose. No one sits back and says, You know what, I prefer losing, it feels great. But to truly understand Winning, you must also understand its partner, Losing. Winning and Losing aren’t mortal enemies; they need each other to survive. Without Losing, Winning can’t exist, because if someone is going ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1812))

- to win, that usually means someone else has to lose. It’s a bizarre, twisted partnership. But while Winning is careful and meticulous and elaborately fussy about who gets in, Losing takes everyone, and has no patience for Winning’s drama and pickiness. Take one already, says Losing, the rest are mine. Winning makes you an expert on Losing. You don’t ever get used to it, but you learn to control your reaction, until you have no reaction at all. You become less emotional about it, because the energy it takes to lose your mind over a loss is energy you need to redirect into Winning. And the more you hang on to that emotion, the harder it will be for you to move past it and the harder you’ll make it for everyone else to move past it. You understand it’s part of the process. You don’t have to like it, but you have to face it. It’s a necessary evil, and a reality of competition. If you lost, if you played poorly, if you totally sucked, just say it. I played poorly. I had a bad game. You don’t have to give a reason, you don’t have to explain. It’s already obvious to everyone, so just put it out there and get back to work. Then learn from it, absorb it, take everything you can from it… and get rid of it. It’s over. Sometimes after a game, and especially after a loss, Kobe obtained the game film and we’d watch it together, every moment, every frame. Sometimes we’d be in the car headed to a late dinner, and we’d never get there; we’d just sit in the car analyzing what went right and what went wrong. That’s how you manage a loss. You tear it apart until it loses its power to happen again. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1816))

- The lesson is this: For almost everyone, losing is inevitable. You’re going to lose at some point, it’s part of competing. Your commitment to Winning isn’t to eliminate Losing. Your job is to minimize the downside when you lose, and then do everything possible to recover as quickly as possible after a loss.

- And I’m thinking about my father, Surjit Singh Grover, whose courage and resilience made me what I am today. I lost my dad in 2017, two days after Christmas and two days before his seventy-seventh birthday. I’ve known and been close to many great men, but none impacted my life more indelibly than he did. He wasn’t famous, wasn’t even a sports fan, and he didn’t care about being social, but every day of his life was about Winning, for himself and those around him. From his decision to come to the US to raise his family, to watching his two sons and his many grandchildren grow up to make him proud, he lived every day with a vision of how to do things better, not just for himself but for the love of his life, my mother, Rattan, and for the whole family. He was a man of great faith, a proud Sikh who wore a turban and endured the prejudice that goes along with being “different.” He loved a good dirty joke, saved forty years of newspaper clippings that mentioned my name, and never wavered in his belief that hard work and dedication were the answer to everything. I know he had fears about how he’d take care of everyone counting on him. But he had no doubts about his ability to do it. His resilience became mine. And it’s because of him I can share with you what I’ve learned. Rest in peace, Baba. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1872))

- Of all the things I talked about in Relentless, none made people more agitated than my discussion of the dark side. “Deep inside you,” I wrote, “there’s an undeniable force driving your actions, the part of you that refuses to be ordinary, the piece that stays raw and untamed. Not just instinct, but killer instinct. The kind you keep in the dark, where you crave things you don’t talk about. And you don’t care how it comes across to others, because you know this is who you are, and you wouldn’t change if you could.… “Your dark side is your fuel, your energy. It excites you, keeps you on the edge, recharges you, fills your tank.… It’s an addiction as powerful as your addiction to success.” ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=1919))

Just spread them out all over an imaginary table. Now: Hold your hand over each one, mentally reconnecting with how each made you feel. Warm… nauseous… cold… nothing … radioactive hot. That’s the one. That’s your fuel. The one that burns you without even having to touch it… that’s your dark side fuel.

- I can’t fix perfect. But I can fix messed up. After a half hour of asking direct questions, and getting weak answers, I changed course. “Go home,” I told him. “We’re going to meet again tomorrow, and here’s what I need you to do before then.” His assignment: Go sit somewhere alone—no family or agents or teammates or friends—and ask yourself: What’s real, and what’s fake? Are you healthy? Are you scared? Are you mad at someone? Write it down. Write a whole list if you get going. But you need to find out what’s true and what’s an act, because something is getting in your way. I figured there was a fifty-fifty chance he’d come back, and a 10 percent chance he’d come back with a list. But there he was the next day, with notes he’d typed in his phone, and he was rocked. Everything was fake. He didn’t trust the people around him. He didn’t trust the team. He didn’t trust himself. He doubted his ability. He smoked weed and was afraid to get caught. He had multiple relationships and was afraid all these women in his life would find out about each other. He was worried about letting down his family and ruining his image. He had so many things in his head and in his life I don’t know how he remembered to tie his shoes. I told him the truest thing I know, and maybe you’ve heard me say it: To have what you really want, you first must be who you really are. How can you have any degree of mental clarity with all that chaos in your head? ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=2073))

You can fake being happy, you can fake being successful, you can fake having a great relationship, you can fake confidence and knowledge and just about everything else. But you can’t fake Winning. Because even if you can fool absolutely everyone else… you still know the truth. Winning is an absolute. There’s a score, a dollar sign, a grade, a number on the scale. Even when your win isn’t measured by the numbers—coming back from an injury, starting a new business, having a difficult conversation, getting a promotion, taking a vacation for the first time in years, going down a size in your clothes—there’s something tangible that measures your result. It doesn’t matter how hard you worked, how many hours you spent at the gym or office, how talented you are, how you sacrificed. Did you win? We have so many ways of lying to ourselves.

It rips your mask off, and shows everyone what you knew all along: This ain’t that. You haven’t won anything yet. If “fake it till you make it” is your strategy for success, you have very little chance of making it. Does it make you feel good to show off a huge house or car you don’t really own or can’t afford? If you’re really helping others and doing good things in the world, are others talking about the results, or are you the only one talking? Are you proud of the million fake followers you bought?

If it’s a battle for you to just show up, you’re so far from Winning you won’t find it with GPS and a team of hunting dogs. Winning demands you show up with purpose and intention and discipline. When someone says, “Showing up is half the battle,” you’re looking at an individual who is already losing that battle.

It doesn’t have to decide whether to show up at 40 percent or 90 percent. It doesn’t care if you show up at all, because you’re expendable; if you can’t summon the desire and energy to make it, someone else will. Winning shows up ready to play.

You don’t need the almond-crusted fish with fancy sauce; you can have grilled fish plain. No cookies. No fruit for now. “Bananas?” he asks. Deep breath from me: “I just said ‘No fruit.’ Drop some weight and then we’ll talk about bananas.” When we started together, he said, “I’d like to have more options.” “You want options?” I asked. “Okay. You have the option of losing weight or gaining weight. Let me know.” The more options you add, the less likely you are to get the desired result. You already know what to do, and then you decide to get creative and start “tweaking.” I hate tweaking. Tweaking just means: Let me see how I can cheat a little here or there, make it a little easier, give myself an out. I already had the right answer, but let me see how I can screw this up. The greats aren’t asking for options. They already know the choice: Win or don’t win. I’m not inflexible. If there’s room to adapt and a reason to make small changes, we’ll do that. But being tired of grilled fish isn’t going to be the reason. For my athletes, sticking with Plan A can involve everything from how often they need to get in an ice bath to when and what they can drink. I live in the real world, I’m not telling adults they can’t have a drink. But I do ask questions that require them to take a stand: Can you drink the clear tequila instead of the brown tequila? Can you leave out the mixers and syrups? Yes? Okay. The greater the player, the more latitude there is for variations, because their abilities will compensate for indulgences.

- Kobe’s secret weapon: He had the unfaltering ability to focus on what he was doing, for as long as he needed to, until he got the results he wanted. Most people worry about how long something will take. Winners just keep going until it gets done. Kobe didn’t measure time; he didn’t care how long it would take or what else he had to do. He only cared about whether it would contribute to his results. It didn’t matter to him if we were in the gym at 3:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m. He didn’t know how many years he’d play, he just knew how many rings he wanted. He didn’t have a timetable for writing a bestselling book or producing an Oscar-winning film, he just wanted it done. Now. You can’t achieve that level of success by wondering how much time you have. You can only focus on the results, and keep sprinting toward greatness until you’re forced to stop. It took death to make Kobe stop. In the words of Kobe’s great friend and mentor Michael Jordan: “I’ve never lost a game. I just ran out of time.” Most people never think about running out of time. They look ahead and see days and months and years of empty dates on the calendar, and assume they have plenty of time to fill them. Kobe’s success wasn’t the result of managing his time.

Instead of counting down to the end of the calendar—and blowing off December because of holidays and parties and year-end fatigue—count each and every day that you can still accomplish something before the end of the year, as everyone else checks out. When you count up, you never get to zero, so you never lose momentum; you can start the new year at full strength, while everyone else tries to remember where they left off. Time tells you what you didn’t accomplish. Focus turns off the clock and directs all your energy to the result.

- you how late you are, focus takes you to that place where you have no idea how much time has passed, and you don’t care. Time reminds you how much you didn’t get done. Focus locks you in, until you finish. Time tells you to stop what you’re doing and get some sleep. Focus tells you there’s more to do. You can sleep when the job is done. Time pressure is external. Focus comes from inside you, where no one else can control it. Time creates distractions. Focus blocks them out. Time tells you to hurry. Focus tells time to STFU. When you’re managing time, all you can see is how long it will take. When you’re managing focus, you don’t care. Time is about others. Focus is all about you.

- How do you know if a goal is worth it? Ask yourself three simple questions. And if the answer to all three isn’t yes, Winning would like you to move on to something else: Do you want to do it? Is this your idea, or someone else’s? Is it your dream, or are you doing it to please others?

- you have to crave it enough to make it your obsession. Can you do it? If you’re not able, if you don’t have the skill or means to make it happen, all the focus in the world isn’t going to deliver the results. You must be realistic about what you’re capable of achieving, so that you’re focusing on something that has at least a chance of working. Is it worth your time? I mean, really, really worth your time? Will it be worth the sacrifice and commitment and relentless grind? Because Winning wants all of your attention, not just spare moments when you have nothing else to do. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LF3LD7S&location=2369))
