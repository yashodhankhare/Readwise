## Highlights
- In transporting the breath, the inhalation must be full. When it is full, it has big capacity. When it has big capacity, it can be extended. When it is extended, it can penetrate downward. When it penetrates downward, it will become calmly settled. When it is calmly settled, it will be strong and firm. When it is strong and firm, it will germinate. When it germinates, it will grow. When it grows, it will retreat upward. When it retreats upward, it will reach the top of the head. The secret power of Providence moves above. The secret power of the Earth moves below. He who follows this will live. He who acts against this will die. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=90))

- After a few months of living this way, I took my doctor’s advice and signed up for an introductory course in breathing to learn a technique called Sudarshan Kriya. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=131))

- Not so much. I looked for some kind of verification of these claims in more recent research in pulmonology, the medical discipline that deals with the lungs and the respiratory tract, but found next to nothing. According to what I did find, breathing technique wasn’t important. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=185))

- Many doctors, researchers, and scientists I interviewed confirmed this position. Twenty times a minute, ten times, through the mouth, nose, or breathing tube, it’s all the same. The point is to get air in and let the body do the rest. To get a sense of how breathing is regarded by modern medical professionals, think back to your last check-up. Chances are your doctor took your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, then placed a stethoscope to your chest to assess the health of your heart and lungs. Maybe she discussed diet, taking vitamins, stresses at work. Any issues digesting food? How about sleep? Were the seasonal allergies getting worse? Asthma? What about those headaches? But she likely never checked your respiratory rate. She never checked the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. How you breathe and the quality of each breath were not on the menu. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=187))

- On a more inspiring note, some of these researchers were also showing that many modern maladies—asthma, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, psoriasis, and more—could either be reduced or reversed simply by changing the way we inhale and exhale. This work was upending long-held beliefs in Western medical science. Yes, breathing in different patterns really can influence our body weight and overall health. Yes, how we breathe really does affect the size and function of our lungs. Yes, breathing allows us to hack into our own nervous system, control our immune response, and restore our health. Yes, changing how we breathe will help us live longer. No matter what we eat, how much we exercise, how resilient our genes are, how skinny or young or wise we are—none of it will matter unless we’re breathing correctly. That’s what these researchers discovered. The missing pillar in health is breath. It all starts there. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=205))

- I call this a “lost art” because so many of these new discoveries aren’t new at all. Most of the techniques I’ll be exploring have been around for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years. They were created, documented, forgotten, and discovered in another culture at another time, then forgotten again. This went on for centuries. Many early pioneers in this discipline weren’t scientists. They were tinkerers, a kind of rogue group I call “pulmonauts,” who stumbled on the powers of breathing because nothing else could help them. They were Civil War surgeons, French hairdressers, anarchist opera singers, Indian mystics, irritable swim coaches, stern-faced Ukrainian cardiologists, Czechoslovakian Olympians, and North Carolina choral conductors. Few of these pulmonauts achieved much fame or respect when they were alive, and when they died their research was buried and scattered. It was even more fascinating to learn that, during the past few years, their techniques were being rediscovered and scientifically tested and proven. The fruits of this once-fringe, often forgotten research are now redefining the potential of the human body. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=217))

- Where Morton claimed to see inferior races and genetic “degradation,” Evans discovered something close to perfection. To demonstrate what she meant, she walked over to a cabinet and retrieved a skull marked Parsee, for Persian, from behind the protective glass. She wiped bone dust on the sleeve of her cashmere sweater and ran a neatly trimmed fingernail along its jaw and face. “These are twice as large as they are today,” she said in a staccato Ukrainian accent. She was pointing at the nasal apertures, the two holes that connect the sinuses to the back of the throat. She turned the skull around so it was staring at us. “So wide and pronounced,” she said approvingly. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=373))

- Evolution doesn’t always mean progress, Evans told me. It means change. And life can change for better or worse. Today, the human body is changing in ways that have nothing to do with the “survival of the fittest.” Instead, we’re adopting and passing down traits that are detrimental to our health. This concept, called dysevolution, was made popular by Harvard biologist Daniel Lieberman, and it explains why our backs ache, feet hurt, and bones are growing more brittle. Dysevolution also helps explain why we’re breathing so poorly. To understand how this all happened, and why, Evans told me, we need to go back in time. Way back. To before Homo sapiens were even sapiens. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=395))

- We began to look less like apes and more like people. If you could take a Homo erectus, dress him in a Brooks Brothers suit, and put him on a subway, he probably wouldn’t draw a second glance. These ancient ancestors were so similar to us that they very likely could have had our children. The innovation of mashing and cooking food, however, had consequences. The quickly growing brain needed space to stretch out, and it took it from the front of our faces, home to sinuses, mouths, and airways. Over time, muscles at the center of the face loosened, and bones in the jaw weakened and grew thinner. The face shortened and the mouth shrank, leaving behind a bony protuberance that replaced the squashed snout of our ancestors. This new feature was ours alone and distinguished us from other primates: the protruding nose. The problem was that this smaller, vertically positioned nose was less efficient at filtering air, and it exposed us to more airborne pathogens and bacteria. The smaller sinuses and mouth also reduced space in our throats. The more we cooked, the more soft, calorie-rich food we consumed, the larger our brains grew and the tighter our airways became.

- In colder climates, our noses would grow narrower and longer to more efficiently heat up air before it entered our lungs; our skin would grow lighter to take in more sunshine for production of vitamin D. In sunny and warm environments, we adapted wider and flatter noses, which were more efficient at inhaling hot and humid air; our skin would grow darker to protect us from the sun. Along the way, the larynx would descend in the throat to accommodate another adaptation: vocal communication. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=432))

- The larynx works as a valve to shuttle food into the stomach and protect us from inhaling it and other objects. Every animal, and every other Homo species, had evolved a higher larynx, located toward the top of the throat. This made sense, since a high larynx functions most efficiently, allowing the body to rid itself quickly should anything get stuck in our airways. As humans developed speech, the larynx sank, opening up space in the back of the mouth and allowing a wider range of vocalizations and volumes. Smaller lips were easier to manipulate, and ours evolved to be thinner and less bulbous. More nimble and flexible tongues made it easier to control the nuance and structure of sounds, so the tongue slipped farther down the throat and pushed the jaw forward. But this lowered larynx became less efficient at its original purpose. It created too much space at the back of the mouth and made early humans susceptible to choking. We could choke if we swallowed something too big, and we’d choke on smaller objects that were swallowed quickly and sloppily. Sapiens would become the only animals, and the only human species, that could easily choke on food and die. Strangely, sadly, the same adaptations that would allow our ancestors to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlive other animals—a mastery of fire and processing food, an enormous brain, and the ability to communicate in a vast ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=436))

- range of sounds—would obstruct our mouths and throats and make it much harder for us to breathe. This recessed growth would, much later, make us prone to choke on our own bodies when we slept: to snore.* None of this mattered to the early humans, of course. For tens of thousands of years, our ancestors would use their wildly developed heads to breathe just fine. Armed with a nose, a voice, and a supersized brain, humans took over the world.

- I’ve got a pulse oximeter device about the size of a matchbook strapped to my wrist. There’s a glowing red wire extending from it and wrapping around my middle finger. Every few seconds, the device records my heart rate and blood oxygen levels, using this information to assess how often and how severely my too-deep tongue might get lodged in my too-small mouth and cause me to hold my breath, a condition more commonly known as sleep apnea. To gauge the severity of my snoring and apnea, I’ve downloaded a phone app that records a constant stream of audio through the night, then provides a minute-to-minute graph of my breathing health every morning. A night vision security camera just above the bed monitors every movement. Inflammation in the throat and polyps both contribute to snoring and sleep apnea. Nasal obstruction triggers this nighttime choking as well, but nobody knows how quickly the damage comes on, or how severe it might become. Before now, nobody had tested it.

- The readouts reveal what the previous days have revealed: mouthbreathing is destroying our health. My blood pressure has spiked by an average of 13 points from where it was before the test, which puts me deep into stage 1 hypertension. If left unchecked, this state of chronically raised blood pressure, also shared by a third of the U.S. population, can cause heart attacks, stroke, and other serious problems. Meanwhile, my heart rate variability, a measure of nervous system balance, has plummeted, suggesting that my body is in a state of stress. Then there’s my pulse, which has increased, and my body temperature, which has decreased, and my mental clarity, which has hit rock bottom. Olsson’s data mirror mine. But the worst part about all this is how we feel: awful. Every day it all just seems to be getting worse. And every day, at this exact time, Olsson finishes off his last test, removes the respirator mask from his cotton-white hair, stands up, and jams the silicone plugs a little deeper into his nostrils. He puts his sweatshirt back on and says, “I’ll see you later,” then walks out the door. I nod and watch as ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=483))

- he trots his slippered feet through the hallways and back across the street. The final testing protocol, eating, happens alone. Through both phases of the experiment, we’ll be eating the same food at the same time and continuously recording our blood sugar levels while taking the same amount of steps throughout the day to see how mouthbreathing and nasal breathing might affect weight and metabolism. Today it’s three eggs, half an avocado, a piece of German brown bread, and a pot of Lapsang tea. Which means that, ten days from now, I will again be sitting in this kitchen, eating this same meal. After eating, I do the dishes, clean up used filters, pH strips, and Post-it notes in the living room laboratory, and answer some emails. Sometimes Olsson and I sit around and experiment with more comfortable and effective ways to keep our noses blocked: waterproof earplugs (too hard), foam earplugs (too soft), a swimmer’s nose clip (too painful), a CPAP nose pillow (comfortable, but it looks like a bondage device), toilet paper (too airy), chewing gum (too slimy), and, finally, surgical tape over silicone or foam earplugs, which is chafing and stifling but the least atrocious of the options. But most of the time, all day, every day, for the past five days, Olsson and I have just sat around alone in our apartments and hated life. I often feel as though I’m trapped in ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=491))

- Luckily, today is a little different. Today, Olsson and I are going on a bike ride. Not on a beach boardwalk or in the shadow of the Golden Gate, but inside the concrete walls of a fluorescent-lit neighborhood gym. The cycling was Olsson’s idea. He’d spent about ten years researching the differences in performance between nasal breathers and mouthbreathers during intense exercise. He’d conducted his own studies on CrossFit athletes, and he’d worked with coaches. He’d become convinced that mouthbreathing can put the body into a state of stress that can make us more quickly fatigued and sap athletic performance. He insisted that, for a few… ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=502))

Mouthbreathing leads to sickness and is disrespectful, he told me, which is why he and everyone else he grew up with in Puebla, Mexico, learned to breathe through the nose. Antonio told me his partner, Janet, suffers from chronic obstruction and runny nose. Janet’s son, Anthony, is also a chronic mouthbreather. He’s starting to suffer the same problems. “I keep telling them this is bad, they try to fix it,” Antonio said. “But it’s hard, man.” ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=513))

- To understand how and why Douillard’s experiment worked, we first need to understand the ways the body makes energy from air and food. There are two options: with oxygen, a process known as aerobic respiration, and without it, which is called anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic energy is generated only with glucose (a simple sugar), and it’s quicker and easier for our bodies to access. It’s a kind of backup system and turbo boost when the body doesn’t have enough oxygen. But anaerobic energy is inefficient and can be toxic, creating an excess of lactic acid. The nausea, muscle weakness, and sweating you experience after you’ve pushed it too hard at the gym ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=548))

- is the feeling of anaerobic overload. This process explains why the first few minutes of an intense workout are often so miserable. Our lungs and respiratory system haven’t caught up to supply the oxygen our bodies need, and so the body has to use anaerobic respiration. This also explains why, after we’re warmed up, exercise feels easier. The body has switched from anaerobic to aerobic respiration. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=553))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Essentially, anaerobic energy is like a muscle car—it’s fast and responsive for quick trips, but polluting and impractical for long hauls. This is why aerobic respiration is so important. Remember those cells that evolved to eat oxygen 2.5 billion years ago and kicked off an explosion of life? We’ve got some 37 trillion of them in our bodies. When we run our cells aerobically with oxygen, we gain some 16 times more energy efficiency over anaerobic. The key for exercise, and for the rest of life, is to stay in that energy-efficient, clean-burning, oxygen-eating aerobic zone for the vast majority of time during exercise and at all times during rest.

- Finding the best heart rate for exercise is easy: subtract your age from 180. The result is the maximum your body can withstand to stay in the aerobic state. Long bouts of training and exercise can happen below this rate but never above it, otherwise the body will risk going too deep into the anaerobic zone for too long. Instead of feeling invigorated and strong after a workout, you’d feel tired, shaky, and nauseated. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=572))

- Mouthbreathing, it turns out, changes the physical body and transforms airways, all for the worse. Inhaling air through the mouth decreases pressure, which causes the soft tissues in the back of the mouth to become loose and flex inward, creating less space and making breathing more difficult. Mouthbreathing begets more mouthbreathing. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=593))
    - Tags: [[breathe]] 
- Inhaling from the nose has the opposite effect. It forces air against all those flabby tissues at the back of the throat, making the airways wider and breathing easier. After a while, these tissues and muscles get “toned” to stay in this opened and wide position. Nasal breathing begets more nasal breathing. “Whatever happens to the nose affects what’s happening in the mouth, the airways, the lungs,” said Patrick McKeown during a phone interview. He’s a bestselling Irish author and one of the world’s leading experts on nasal breathing. “These aren’t separate things that operate autonomously—it’s one united airway,” he told me. None of this should come as a surprise. When seasonal allergies hit, incidences of sleep apnea and breathing difficulties shoot up. The nose gets stuffed, we start mouthbreathing, and the airways collapse. “It’s simple physics,” McKeown told me. Sleeping with an open mouth exacerbates these problems. Whenever we put our heads on a pillow, gravity pulls the soft tissues in the throat and tongue down, closing off the airway even more. After a while, our airways get conditioned to this position; snoring and sleep apnea become the new normal. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=595))

- Each night for the past week and a half, I’ve felt as if I was getting softly choked to death in my sleep and my throat was closing in on itself. Because it is, and because I am. Forced mouthbreathing was very likely changing the shape of my airways, just as it did with Harvold’s monkeys. The changes weren’t happening in a matter of months, either, but days. It was getting worse with every breath I took. My snoring has increased 4,820 percent from ten days ago. For the first time that I’m aware of, I’m beginning to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. At my worst, I’ve averaged 25 “apnea events,” meaning I was choking so severely that my oxygen levels dropped to 90 percent or below. Whenever oxygen falls below 90 percent, the blood can’t carry enough of it to support body tissues. If this goes on too long, it can lead to heart failure, depression, memory problems, and early death. My snoring and sleep apnea are still far below that of any medically diagnosed condition, but these scores were getting worse the longer I stayed plugged up. Every morning Olsson and I would listen to recordings of ourselves sleeping the night before. We laughed at first, then we got a bit frightened: what we heard weren’t the sounds of happy Dickensian drunks, but of men being strangled to death by our own bodies. “More wholesome to sleep . . . with the mouth shut,” wrote Levinus Lemnius, a Dutch physician from the 1500s who was credited as one of the first researchers to study snoring. Even back then, Levinus knew how injurious obstructive breathing during sleep could be. “For they that sleep with their Jaws extended, by reason of their breath, and the air tossed to and fro, have their tongues and palates dry, and desire to be moistened by drinking in the night.” This was another thing that kept happening to me. Mouthbreathing causes the body to lose 40 percent more water. I felt this all night, every night, waking up constantly parched and dry. You’d think this moisture loss ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=612))

- would decrease the need to urinate, but, oddly, the opposite was true. During the deepest, most restful stages of sleep, the pituitary gland, a pea-size ball at the base of the brain, secretes hormones that control the release of adrenaline, endorphins, growth hormone, and other substances, including vasopressin, which communicates with cells to store more water. This is how animals can sleep through the night without feeling thirsty or needing to relieve themselves. But if the body has inadequate time in deep sleep, as it does when it experiences chronic sleep apnea, vasopressin won’t be secreted normally. The kidneys will release water, which triggers the need to urinate and signals to our brains that we should consume more liquid. We get thirsty, and we need to pee more. A lack of vasopressin explains not only my own irritable bladder but the constant, seemingly unquenchable thirst I have every night. There are several books that describe the horrendous health effects of snoring and sleep apnea. They explain how these afflictions lead to bed-wetting, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and so on. I’d read a report from the Mayo Clinic which found that chronic insomnia, long assumed to be a psychological problem, is often a breathing problem. The millions of Americans who have a chronic insomnia disorder and who are, right now, like me, staring out bedroom windows, or at TVs, phones, or ceilings, can’t sleep because they can’t breathe. And contrary to what most of us might think, no amount of snoring is normal, and no amount of sleep apnea comes without risks of serious health effects. Dr. Christian Guilleminault, a sleep researcher at Stanford, found that children who experienced no apnea events at all—only heavy breathing and light snoring, or “increased respiratory effort”—could suffer from mood disorders, blood pressure derangements, learning disabilities, and more. Mouthbreathing was also making me dumber. A recent Japanese study showed that rats who had their nostrils obstructed and were forced to breathe through their mouths developed fewer brain cells and took twice as long to make their way through a maze than nasal-breathing controls. Another Japanese study in humans from 2013 found that mouthbreathing delivered a disturbance of oxygen to the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with ADHD. Nasal breathing had no such effects. The ancient Chinese were onto it as well. “The breath inhaled through the mouth is called ‘Ni Ch’i, adverse breath,’ which is extremely harmful,” states a passage from the Tao. “Be careful not to have the breath inhaled through the mouth.” ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=627))

- The nose is crucial because it clears air, heats it, and moistens it for easier absorption. Most of us know this. But what so many people never consider is the nose’s unexpected role in problems like erectile dysfunction. Or how it can trigger a cavalcade of hormones and chemicals that lower blood pressure and ease digestion. How it responds to the stages of a woman’s menstrual cycle. How it regulates our heart rate, opens the vessels in our toes, and stores memories. How the density of your nasal hairs helps determine whether you’ll suffer from asthma. Few of us ever consider how the nostrils of every living person pulse to their own rhythm, opening and closing like a flower in response to our moods, mental states, and perhaps even the sun and the moon.

- Still, scientists have known for more than a century that the nostrils do pulse to their own beat, that they do open and close like flowers throughout the day and night. The phenomenon, called nasal cycles, was first described in 1895 by a German physician named Richard Kayser. He noticed that the tissue lining one nostril of his patients seemed to ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=739))

- quickly congest and close while the other would mysteriously open. Then, after about 30 minutes to 4 hours, the nostrils switched, or “cycled.” The shifting appeared to be influenced less by the moon’s mysterious pull and more by sexual urges. The interior of the nose, it turned out, is blanketed with erectile tissue, the same flesh that covers the penis, clitoris, and nipples. Noses get erections. Within seconds, they too can engorge with blood and become large and stiff. This happens because the nose is more intimately connected to the genitals than any other organ; when one gets aroused, the other responds. The mere thought of sex for some people causes such severe bouts of nasal erections that they’ll have trouble breathing and will start to sneeze uncontrollably, an inconvenient condition called “honeymoon rhinitis.” As sexual stimulation weakens and erectile tissue becomes flaccid, the nose will, too. After Kayser’s discovery, decades passed and nobody offered a good reason for why the human nose was lined with erectile tissue, or why the nostrils cycled. There were many theories: some ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=741))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- believed this switching provoked the body to flip over from side to side while sleeping to prevent bedsores. (Breathing is easier through the nostril opposite the pillow.) Others thought the cycling helped protect the nose from respiratory infection and allergies, while still others argued that alternate airflow allows us to smell odors more efficiently. What researchers eventually managed to confirm was that nasal erectile tissue mirrored states of health. It would become inflamed during sickness or other states of imbalance. If the nose became infected, the nasal cycle became more pronounced and switched back and forth quickly. The right and left nasal cavities also worked like an HVAC system, controlling temperature and blood pressure and feeding the brain chemicals to alter our moods, emotions, and sleep states. The right nostril is a gas pedal. When you’re inhaling primarily through this channel, circulation speeds up, your body gets hotter, and cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate all increase. This happens because breathing through the right side of the nose activates the sympathetic nervous system, the “fight or flight” mechanism that puts the body in a more elevated state of alertness and readiness. Breathing through the right nostril will also feed more blood to the opposite hemisphere of the brain, specifically to the prefrontal cortex, which has been associated with logical decisions, language, and computing. Inhaling through the left nostril has the opposite effect: it works as a kind of brake system to the right nostril’s accelerator.… ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=750))

This is why nasal breathing is far more healthy and efficient than breathing through the mouth.

- Having never seen a dentist or doctor, the tribal people had teeth that were perfectly straight—“as regular as the keys of a piano,” Catlin noted. Nobody seemed to get sick, and deformities and other chronic health problems appeared rare or nonexistent. The tribes attributed their vigorous health to a medicine, what Catlin called the “great secret of life.” The secret was breathing. The Native Americans explained to Catlin that breath inhaled through the mouth sapped the body of strength, deformed the face, and caused stress and disease. On the other hand, breath inhaled through the nose kept the body strong, made the face beautiful, and prevented disease. “The air which enters the lungs is as different from that which enters the nostrils as distilled water is different from the water in an ordinary cistern or a frog-pond,” he wrote.

I’m not breathing this way out of some “constant adult conviction,” as Catlin wrote. I’m doing it because my lips are taped shut. Catlin suggested tying a bandage around the jaw at night, but that sounded dangerous and difficult, so I opted for another technique, which I’d heard about months earlier from a dentist who runs a private practice in Silicon Valley.

- “The health benefits of nose breathing are undeniable,” he told me. One of the many benefits is that the sinuses release a huge boost of nitric oxide, a molecule that plays an essential role in increasing circulation and delivering oxygen into cells. Immune function, weight, circulation, mood, and sexual function can all be heavily influenced by the amount of nitric oxide in the body. (The popular erectile dysfunction drug sildenafil, known by the commercial name Viagra, works by releasing nitric oxide into the ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=884))

- bloodstream, which opens the capillaries in the genitals and elsewhere.) Nasal breathing alone can boost nitric oxide sixfold, which is one of the reasons we can absorb about 18 percent more oxygen than by just breathing through the mouth. Mouth taping, Burhenne said, helped a five-year-old patient of his overcome ADHD, a condition directly attributed to breathing difficulties during sleep. It helped Burhenne and his wife cure their own snoring and breathing problems. Hundreds of other patients reported similar benefits. The whole thing seemed a little sketchy until Ann Kearney, a doctor of speech-language pathology at the Stanford Voice and Swallowing Center, told me the same. Kearney helped rehabilitate patients who had swallowing and breathing disorders. She swore by mouth taping. Kearney herself had spent years as a mouthbreather due to chronic congestion. She visited an ear, nose, and throat specialist and discovered that her nasal cavities were blocked with tissue. The specialist advised that the only way to open her nose was through surgery or medications. She tried mouth taping instead.

- belief in Western medicine was that the lungs, like every other internal organ, were immutable. That is, whatever lungs we were born with, we were stuck with. As these organs degraded with age, the only thing we could do was sigh and bear it. Aging was supposed to go like this: Starting around 30, we should expect to lose a little more memory, mobility, and muscle with every passing year. We would also lose the ability to breathe properly. Bones in the chest would become thinner and change shape, causing rib cages to collapse inward. Muscle fibers surrounding the lungs would weaken and prevent air from entering and exiting. All these things reduce lung capacity. The lungs themselves will lose about 12 percent of capacity from the age of 30 to 50, and will continue declining even faster as we get older, with women faring worse than men. If we make it to 80, we’ll be able to take in 30 percent less air than we did in our 20s. We’re forced to breathe faster and harder.

- The subject of intrigue was Carl Stough, a choir conductor and medical anomaly who got his start in the 1940s. Of all the pulmonauts I’d come across over the past several years, Stough was the most elusive. He published one book in 1970, which quickly flopped and went out of print. Twenty years later, a CBS producer put together a one-hour program about his groundbreaking work, but it never aired. Stough himself didn’t advertise his techniques. He never went on speaking tours. Even so, professional opera singers, Grammy-winning saxophonists, paraplegics, and dying emphysemics—thousands of them—managed to find him. Stough broke all the rules; he expanded lungs and extended life spans. And yet, most people today have never heard of him. Martin had worked with Stough for more than two decades. She was a living link to this mysterious man and his research in the lost art of breathing. What Stough had discovered, and what Martin had learned, was that the most important aspect of breathing wasn’t just to take in air through the nose. Inhaling was the easy part. The key to breathing, lung expansion, and the long life that came with it was on the other end of respiration. It was in the transformative power of a full exhalation.

The nurses, meaning well, had placed cushions under patients’ backs so that their chests were arched up. The idea was to create elevation to ease inhalations. Stough instantly saw that this was making the condition worse. Emphysema, he realized, was a disease of exhalation. The patients were suffering not because they couldn’t get fresh air into their lungs, but because they couldn’t get enough stale air out.

- A typical adult engages as little as 10 percent of the range of the diaphragm when breathing, which overburdens the heart, elevates blood pressure, and causes a rash of circulatory problems. Extending those breaths to 50 to 70 percent of the diaphragm’s capacity will ease cardiovascular stress and allow the body to work more efficiently. For this reason, the diaphragm is sometimes referred to as “the second heart,” because it not only beats to its own rhythm but also affects the rate and strength of the heartbeat. Stough discovered that the diaphragms in all of the East Orange emphysema patients had ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1050))

- broken down. X-rays showed that they were extending their diaphragms by only a fraction of what was healthy, taking only a sip of air with each breath. The patients had been sick so long that many of the muscles and joints around their chests had atrophied and stiffened; they had no muscle memory of breathing deep. Over the next two months, Stough reminded them how. “My activities looked silly when observed from a distance, and they seemed silly at the outset to the person with whom I worked,” wrote Stough. He’d begin the treatments by putting patients flat on their backs, running his hands across their torsos, and gently tapping on rigid muscles and distended chests. He’d have them hold their breath and count from one to five as many times in a row as they could. Next, he massaged their necks and throats and lightly coaxed their ribs as he told them to inhale and exhale very slowly, trying to wake the diaphragm from its long slumber. Each of these exercises allowed the patients to let out a little more air so that a little more air could get in.

Another man, who hadn’t been able to breathe for more than 15 minutes without supplemental oxygen, was lasting eight hours. A 55-year-old man who had suffered advanced emphysema for eight years was able to leave the hospital and captain a boat down to Florida.

- There’s nothing controversial about this process of respiration and the role of carbon dioxide in gas exchange. It’s basic biochemistry. What’s less acknowledged is the role carbon dioxide plays in weight loss. That carbon dioxide in every exhale has weight, and we exhale more weight than we inhale. And the way the body loses weight isn’t through profusely sweating or “burning it off.” We lose weight through exhaled breath. For every ten pounds of fat lost in our bodies, eight and a half pounds of it comes out through the lungs; most of it is carbon dioxide mixed with a bit of water vapor.

The lungs are the weight-regulating system of the body. “Everyone always talks about oxygen,” Olsson told me during our interview in Stockholm. “Whether we breathe thirty times or five times a minute, a healthy body will always have enough oxygen!” What our bodies really want, what they require to function properly, isn’t faster or deeper breaths.

- It turns out that when breathing at a normal rate, our lungs will absorb only about a quarter of the available oxygen in the air. The majority of that oxygen is exhaled back out. By taking longer breaths, we allow our lungs to soak up more in fewer breaths. “If, with training and patience, you can perform the same exercise workload with only 14 breaths per minute instead of 47 using conventional techniques, what reason could there be not to do it?” wrote John Douillard, the trainer who’d conducted the stationary bike experiments in the 1990s. “When you see yourself running faster every day, with your breath rate stable . . . you will begin to feel the true meaning of the word fitness.” I realized then that breathing was like rowing a boat: taking a zillion short and stilted strokes will get you where you’re going, but they pale in comparison to the efficiency and speed of fewer, longer strokes.

- A last word on slow breathing. It goes by another name: prayer. When Buddhist monks chant their most popular mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, each spoken phrase lasts six seconds, with six seconds to inhale before the chant starts again. The traditional chant of Om, the “sacred sound of the universe” used in Jainism and other traditions, takes six seconds to sing, with a pause of about six seconds to inhale. The sa ta na ma chant, one of the best-known techniques in Kundalini yoga, also takes six seconds to vocalize, followed by six seconds to inhale. Then there were the ancient Hindu hand and tongue poses called mudras. A technique called khechari, intended to help boost physical and spiritual health and overcome disease, involves placing the tongue above the soft palate so that it’s pointed toward the nasal cavity. The deep, slow breaths taken during this khechari each take six seconds. Japanese, African, Hawaiian, Native American, Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim—these cultures and religions all had somehow developed the same prayer techniques, requiring the same breathing patterns. And they all likely benefited from the same calming effect. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1342))

- But what was even more stunning was what breathing like this did to the subjects. Whenever they followed this slow breathing pattern, blood flow to the brain increased and the systems in the body entered a state of coherence, when the functions of heart, circulation, and nervous system are coordinated to peak efficiency. The moment the subjects returned to spontaneous breathing or talking, their hearts would beat a little more erratically, and the integration of these systems would slowly fall apart. A few more slow and relaxed breaths, and it would return again. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1355))

- One thing that every medical or freelance pulmonaut I’ve talked to over the past several years has agreed on is that, just as we’ve become a culture of overeaters, we’ve also become a culture of overbreathers. Most of us breathe too much, and up to a quarter of the modern population suffers from more serious chronic overbreathing. The fix is easy: breathe less. But that’s harder than it sounds. We’ve become conditioned to breathe too much, just as we’ve been conditioned to eat too much. With some effort and training, however, breathing less can become an unconscious habit. Indian yogis train themselves to decrease the amount of air they take in at rest, not increase it. Tibetan Buddhists prescribed step-by-step instructions to reduce and calm breathing for aspiring monks. Chinese doctors two thousand years ago advised 13,500 breaths per day, which works out to nine and a half breaths per minute. They likely breathed less in those fewer breaths. In Japan, legend has it that samurai would test a soldier’s readiness by placing a feather beneath his nostrils while he inhaled and exhaled. If the feather moved, the soldier would be dismissed. To be clear, breathing less is not the same as breathing slowly. Average adult lungs can hold about four to six liters of air. Which means that, even if we practice slow breathing at 5.5 breaths per minute, we could still be easily taking in twice the air we need. The key to optimum breathing, and all the health, endurance, and longevity benefits that come with it, is to practice fewer inhales and exhales in a smaller volume. To breathe, but to breathe less.

- Each breath we draw in should take about three seconds, and each breath out should take four. We’ll then continue the same short inhales while lengthening the exhales to a five, six, and seven count as the run progresses. Slower, longer exhales, of course, mean higher carbon dioxide levels. With that bonus carbon dioxide, we gain a higher aerobic endurance. This measurement of highest oxygen consumption, called VO2 max, is the best gauge of cardiorespiratory fitness. Training the body to breathe less actually increases VO2 max, which can not only boost athletic stamina but also help us live longer and healthier lives.

- What if overbreathing wasn’t the result of hypertension and headaches but the cause? Buteyko wondered. Heart disease, ulcers, and chronic inflammation were all linked to disturbances in circulation, blood pH, and metabolism. How we breathe affects all those functions. Breathing just 20 percent, or even 10 percent more than the body’s needs could overwork our systems. Eventually, they’d weaken and falter. Was breathing too much making people sick, and keeping them that way? Buteyko took a walk. In the asthma ward, he found a man stooped over, fighting suffocation, gasping for air. Buteyko approached and showed him the technique he’d been using on himself. After a few minutes, the patient calmed down. He inhaled a careful and clear breath through his nose and then calmly exhaled. Suddenly, his face flushed with color. The asthma attack was over.

- We’ve been practicing an extreme version of the techniques Buteyko used on himself and in the asthma ward: limiting our inhales while extending exhales far past the point of what feels comfortable, or even safe. We’re sweating and red-faced and I can feel veins bulging in my neck. I’m not exactly out of breath, but I don’t feel satisfied, either. Even when I sip a little more air, I feel like I’m being mildly strangled. The point of this exercise isn’t to inflict unnecessary pain. It’s to get the body comfortable with higher levels of carbon dioxide, so that we’ll unconsciously breathe less during our resting hours and the next time we work out. So that we’ll release more oxygen, increase our endurance, and better support all the functions in our bodies. “Try to extend the exhales even more,” Olsson says as he takes tiny nips of air through his nose. “Breathe out twice as long for each inhale, three times,” he chides me. For a moment, I feel like I’m going to puke. “Yes!” he says. “Even slower, even less!” ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1468))

- Buteyko developed a protocol based on the breathing habits of these healthiest patients, which he’d later call Voluntary Elimination of Deep Breathing. The techniques were many and they varied, but the purpose of each was to train patients to always breathe as closely as possible to their metabolic needs, which almost always meant taking in less air. How many breaths we took per minute was less important to Buteyko, as long as we were breathing no more than about six liters per minute at rest. Within a few sessions of practicing these techniques, patients reported tingling and heat in their hands and toes. Their heart rates would slow and stabilize. The hypertension and migraines that had debilitated so many of them would begin to disappear. Those already in good health felt even better. Athletes claimed big gains in performance.

When the management at the shoe factory where he was working elected him for a local race, he tried to refuse. Zátopek told them he was unfit, that he had no interest, that he’d never run in a competition. But he competed anyway and came in second out of 100 contestants. Zátopek saw a brighter future for himself in running, and began to take the sport more seriously. Four years later he broke the Czech national records for the 2,000, 3,000, and 5,000 meters. Zátopek developed his own training methods to give himself an edge. He’d run as fast as he could holding his breath, take a few huffs and puffs and then do it all again. It was an extreme version of Buteyko’s methods, but Zátopek didn’t call it Voluntary Elimination of Deep Breathing. Nobody did. It would become known as hypoventilation training. Hypo, which comes from the Greek for “under” (as in hypodermic needle), is the opposite of hyper, meaning “over.” The concept of hypoventilation training was to breathe less.

I can’t figure out if it’s bad luck or shortsightedness that has led me to repeatedly pursue topics of research like freediving, Voluntary Elimination of Deep Breathing, and hypoventilation therapy that require me to hold my breath and torture my lungs for hours a day. “The key is to find a rhythm that works for you,” Olsson keeps saying. The rhythm is definitely not working. I return to my more manageable practice, inhaling for two steps and exhaling for five, a pattern competitive cyclists use. This isn’t exactly comfortable, but it’s tolerable. We run across the cracked asphalt of a beachside parking lot, passing a few rusting Winnebagos and hopping over condom wrappers and smashed cans of malt liquor before heading back across the highway. Minutes later we’re back in the quietude of the park, treading a dirt path beneath an understory of trees along a black pond filled with quacking ducks. That’s when it starts to hit me: an intense heat at the back of my neck and pixelated vision. I’m still jogging, exhaling long breaths, but it feels as though I’m simultaneously jumping headfirst ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1547))

The warmth moves higher through my face and wraps around the crown of my head. This must be the good headache Olsson was talking about, of carbon dioxide increasing and oxygen dislodging from hemoglobin to those hungry cells, of the vessels in my brain and body expanding, so engorged with fresh blood that they’re sending dull pain signals to my nervous system.

- In the decades since Buteyko first started training patients to breathe less, asthma has become a global epidemic. Nearly 25 million Americans now suffer from it—that’s about 8 percent of the population, and a fourfold increase since 1980. Asthma is the leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days for children. It is considered a controllable but incurable disease. Asthma is an immune system sensitivity that provokes constriction and spasms in the airways. Pollutants, dust, viral infections, cold air, and more can all lead to attacks. But asthma can be brought on by overbreathing, which is why it’s so common during physical exertion, a condition called exercise-induced asthma that affects ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1574))

- around 15 percent of the population and up to 40 percent of athletes. At rest or during exercise, asthmatics as a whole tend to breathe more—sometimes much more—than those without asthma. Once an attack starts, things go from bad to worse. Air gets trapped in the lungs and passageways constrict, which makes it harder to push air out and back in. More breathing but more feelings of breathlessness ensue, more constriction, more panic, and more stress. The worldwide annual market for asthma therapies is $20 billion, and drugs often work so well that they can feel like a virtual cure. But drugs, in particular oral steroids, can have horrendous side effects after several years, including deteriorating lung function, worsened asthma symptoms, blindness, and increased risk of death. Millions of asthma sufferers already know this, and are experiencing these problems for themselves. Many of them have trained themselves to breathe less and reported dramatic improvement. For several months before the Stanford experiment, I interviewed Buteyko practitioners and collected their stories.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- scientific validation on the restorative effects of breathing less. One study at the Mater Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, found that when asthmatic adults followed Buteyko’s methods and decreased their air intake by a third, symptoms of breathlessness reduced by 70 percent and the need for reliever medication decreased by around 90 percent. A half-dozen other clinical trials showed similar results. Meanwhile, the Papworth Method, a breathing-less technique developed in an English hospital in the 1960s, was also shown to cut asthma symptoms by a third.* Still, nobody seems to know exactly why breathing less has been so effective in treating asthma and other respiratory conditions. Nobody knows exactly how it works. There are several theories. “It is a deficiency in the body that causes symptoms,” said Dr. Ira Packman, an internist and former medical expert for the Pennsylvania Insurance Department who overcame his own debilitating asthma by breathing less. “Replace the deficient element,” he told me, “and the patient gets better.” ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1621))

The techniques they used varied, but all circled around the same premise: to extend the length of time between inhalations and exhalations.

- respiratory efficiency—and the further a body can go. This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Nature functions in orders of magnitude. Mammals with the lowest resting heart rates live the longest. And it’s no coincidence that these are consistently the same mammals that breathe the slowest. The only way to retain a slow resting heart rate is with slow breaths. This is as true for baboons and bison as it is for blue whales and us. “The yogi’s life is not measured by the number of his days, but the number of his breaths,” wrote B. K. S. Iyengar, an Indian yoga teacher who had spent years in bed as a sickly child until he learned yoga and breathed himself back to health. He died in 2014, at age 95. I’d hear this repeated over and over again by Olsson during our early Skype chats and again throughout the Stanford experiment. I’d read about it in Stough’s research. Buteyko and the Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus, and 9/11 survivors were aware of it as well. By various means, in various ways, in various eras of human history, all these pulmonauts discovered the same thing. They discovered that the optimum amount of air ([Location 1656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1656))

- we should take in at rest per minute is 5.5 liters. The optimum breathing rate is about 5.5 breaths per minute. That’s 5.5-second inhales and 5.5-second exhales. This is the perfect breath. Asthmatics, emphysemics, Olympians, and almost anyone, anywhere, can benefit from breathing this way for even a few minutes a day, much longer if possible: to inhale and exhale in a way that feeds our bodies just the right amount of air, at just the right time, to perform at peak capacity. To just keep breathing, less. ([Location 1664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1664))

- collected during his travels. It was “a masterpiece of research,” according to the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Earnest Hooton called it one of the “epochal pieces of research.” But others hated it, and vehemently disagreed with Price’s conclusions. It wasn’t Price’s facts and figures, or even his dietary advice that made them bristle. Most of what he’d discovered about the modern diet had already been verified by nutritionists years earlier. But some complained that Price overreached, that his observations were too anecdotal and his sample sizes too small. None of it mattered. By the 1940s, the idea of spending hours a day preparing meals of fish eyes and moose glands, raw roots and cow blood, coconut crabs and pig kidneys, seemed outdated and quaint. It was also way too much work. Many people moved to cities to get away from those foods and the grimy lifestyle that came with them. Price, it turned out, was also only half right. Yes, vitamin deficiencies might explain why so many people eating industrialized foods were sick; they might explain why so many were getting cavities and why their bones were growing thin and weak. But they couldn’t fully explain the sudden and extreme shrinking of the mouth and blocking of airways that swept through modern societies. Even if our ancestors consumed a full spectrum of vitamins and minerals every day, their mouths would still grow too small, teeth would come in crooked, and airways would become obstructed. What was true for our ancestors was also true for us. The problem had less to do with what we were eating than how we ate it. Chewing. It was the constant stress of chewing that was lacking from our diets—not vitamin A, B, C, or D. Ninety-five percent of the modern, processed diet was soft. Even what’s considered healthy food today—smoothies, nut butters, oatmeal, avocados, whole wheat bread, vegetable soups. It’s all soft. Our ancient ancestors chewed for hours a day, every day. And because they chewed so much, their mouths, teeth, throats, and faces grew to be wide and strong and pronounced. Food in industrialized societies was so processed that it hardly required any chewing at all. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1816))

- Sometimes the nostrils are the problem, not the sinuses. Nostrils that are too small or that collapse too easily during an inhale can inhibit the free flow of air and contribute to breathing problems. This condition is so common that researchers have an official name for it, “nasal valve collapse,” and an official measurement, called the Cottle’s maneuver. It involves placing an index finger on the side of one or both nostrils and gently pulling each cheek outward, lightly spreading the nostrils open. If doing this improves the ease of nasal inhales, there’s a chance that the nostrils are too small or thin. Many people with this condition receive minimally invasive surgery, or use adhesive strips called Breathe Right or nasal dilator cones.

- By the 1940s, it became standard practice for dentists to extract teeth then crane back the remaining top teeth with headgear, braces, and other orthodontic devices. Fewer teeth were easier to handle and offered more consistent results. By the 1950s, tooth extractions—two, four, even six at a time—and retractive orthodontics were routine in the United States. There was a glaring problem with this approach: removing teeth and pushing remaining teeth backward only made a too-small mouth smaller. A smaller mouth might be easy for dentists to manage, but it also offered less room to breathe. A few months, or years, after their mouths were compressed with braces and headgear, some patients would complain about breathing difficulties like snoring, sleep apnea, hay fever, and asthma that they’d never had before. When they bit down, they noticed a clicking sound at the back of their jaws, along the temporomandibular joint. Some began to look different, their faces growing longer, flatter, and less defined. These patients might have represented only a small percentage. But enough showed the same breathing problems, chewing problems, and downward facial growth that, in the late 1950s, a former biplane pilot, semiprofessional Formula 1 driver, and British facial surgeon and dentist named Dr. John Mew took notice. Mew began measuring the faces and mouths of young patients who’d gotten extractions, and compared them with patients who’d gotten expansion treatment. Brothers and sisters measured against their siblings, even sets of identical twins.

- orthodontics suffered from the same stunted mouth and facial growth. As they grew up, and the rest of their bodies and heads grew larger, their mouths were forced to stay the same size. This mismatch created a problem at the center of the face: eyes would droop, cheeks would puff up, and chins would recess. The more teeth these patients had extracted, the longer they wore braces and other devices, the more obstruction seemed to develop in their airways. Mew called the pattern “sadly a common sequel to fixed orthodontic treatment.” In a strange twist, he found that the devices invented to fix crooked teeth caused by too-small mouths were making mouths smaller and breathing worse.

- Mew’s son, Mike, who is also a dentist, joined the conversation. Mike was tanned, tall, and lanky, with piercing brown eyes, dressed in fashion jeans and a tight-fitting sweater. He explained that the first step to improving airway obstruction wasn’t orthodontics but instead involved maintaining correct “oral posture.” Anyone could do this, and it was free. It just meant holding the lips together, with teeth almost touching (molars two to three millimeters apart) and the tongue on the roof of the mouth. Hold the head up perpendicular to the body and don’t kink the neck. When sitting or standing, the spine should form a slight J shape—straight until it reaches the small of the back, where it naturally curves outward. While maintaining this posture, we should always breathe slowly through the nose into the abdomen. Our bodies and airways are designed to work best in this posture, both Mews agreed. Look at any Greek statue, or a drawing by Leonardo, or an ancient portrait. Everyone shared this J shape. But if we look around public spaces today, it’s obvious that most people have shoulders hunched forward, neck extended outward, and an S-shaped ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=1999))

- shaped spine. “A bunch of village idiots, that’s what we’ve become,” shouted Mike. He then assumed this “idiot” position, inhaled a few short, puffy, open-mouth breaths, and looked around dumbly. “It’s bloody killing us!” Many of us adopted this S posture not because of laziness but because our tongues don’t fit properly in our too-small mouths. Having nowhere else to go, the tongue falls back into the throat, creating a mild suffocation. At night, we choke and cough, attempting to push air in and out of this obstructed airway. This, of course, is sleep apnea, and a quarter of Americans suffer from it. By day, we unconsciously attempt to open our obstructed airways by sloping our shoulders, craning our necks forward, and tilting our heads up. “Think of someone who is unconscious and about to receive CPR,” Mike said. The first thing a medic does is tilt the head back to open the throat. We’ve adopted this CPR posture all the time. Our bodies hate this position. The weight of the sloping head stresses the back muscles, leading to back pain; the kink in our necks adds pressure to the brain stem, triggering headaches and other neurological problems; the tilted angle of our faces stretches the skin down from the eyes, thins the upper lip, pulls flesh down on the nasal bone. Because “the village idiot stare” doesn’t sound scientific, Mike calls this posture “cranial dystrophy.” He claims it affects about 50 percent of the modern population, including Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. In January 2018, Mike uploaded a YouTube video warning Zuckerberg that he was going to die ten years early if he didn’t correct his cranial dystrophy posture.

It’s difficult to convey mewing without seeing it, but the gist is to push the back of the tongue against the back roof of the mouth and move the rest of the tongue forward, like a wave, until the tip hits just behind the front teeth.

- It starts at infancy. The chewing and sucking stress required for breastfeeding exercises the masseter and other facial muscles and stimulates more stem cell growth, stronger bones, and more pronounced airways. Until a few hundred years ago, mothers would breastfeed infants up to two to four years of age, and sometimes to adolescence. The more time infants spent chewing and sucking, the more developed their faces and airways would become, and the better they’d breathe later in life. Dozens of studies in the past two decades have supported this claim. They’ve shown lower incidence of crooked teeth and snoring and sleep apnea in infants who were breastfed longer over those who were bottle-fed.

But like most discomforts in life, it got easier and less annoying the longer I did it. ([Location 2116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2116))

- This is what I learned at the end of this long and very strange trip through the causes and cures of airway obstruction. That our noses and mouths are not predetermined at birth, childhood, or even in adulthood. We can reverse the clock on much of the damage that’s been done in the past few hundred years by force of will, with nothing more than proper posture, hard chewing, and perhaps some mewing. And with the obstruction out of the way, we can finally get back to breathing. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2126))

- The techniques I’ll pursue from this point forward will not hold to the slow-and-steady style. They are not accessible to everyone, everywhere. You can’t practice them while flipping through the pages of this book. Several take a long time to master, require concerted effort, and can be uncomfortable. Pulmonary medicine has many scary names for what these more extreme techniques can do to the body and mind: respiratory acidosis, alkalosis, hypocapnia, sympathetic nervous system overload, extreme apnea. Under normal circumstances, these conditions are considered damaging and would require medical care. But something else happens when we practice these techniques willingly, when we consciously push our bodies into these states for a few minutes, or hours, a day. In some cases, they can radically transform lives. Collectively, I’m calling these potent techniques Breathing+, because they build on the foundation of practices I described earlier in this book, and because many require extra focus ([Location 2140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2140))

These methods, too, date back thousands of years, vanished, then were rediscovered again at a different time in a different culture, renamed and redeployed. At best, Breathing+ can offer a deeper view into the secrets of our most basic biological function. At worst, breathing this way can provoke heavy sweats, nausea, and exhaustion. This, I would learn, is all part of the process. It’s the respiratory gauntlet required to get to the other side.

Most would be sent back to war. The few still suffering would be placed in the “invalid corps” or shipped home to deal with the syndrome for the rest of their lives. Da Costa recorded reams of data on these men, and he released a formal clinical study in 1871, which would become a landmark in the history of cardiovascular disease. But Irritable Heart Syndrome wasn’t confined to just the Civil War. The same symptoms would show up half a century later in 20 percent of soldiers who fought in World War I, a million soldiers in World War II, and hundreds of thousands more in Vietnam and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Doctors dreamed up new names for these problems along the way, believing they had discovered a new kind of illness. They told soldiers they suffered from shell shock, soldier’s heart, post-Vietnam syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder. They considered the ailments to be psychological, some disturbance in the brain ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2173))

- Breathing, as it happens, is more than just a biochemical or physical act; it’s more than just moving the diaphragm downward and sucking in air to feed hungry cells and remove wastes. The tens of billions of molecules we bring into our bodies with every breath also serve a more subtle, but equally important role. They influence nearly every internal organ, telling them when to turn on and off. They affect heart rate, digestion, moods, attitudes; when we feel aroused, and when we feel nauseated. Breathing is a power switch to a vast network called the autonomic nervous system. There are two sections of this system, and they serve opposite functions. Each is essential to our well-being. The first, called the parasympathetic nervous system, stimulates relaxation and restoration. The mellow buzz you get during a long massage or the sleepiness you feel after a big meal happens because the parasympathetic nervous system sends signals to your stomach to digest and to the brain to pump feel-good hormones such as serotonin and oxytocin into your bloodstream. Parasympathetic stimulation opens the floodgates in our eyes and makes tears flow at weddings. It prompts salivation before meals, loosens the bowels to eliminate waste, and stimulates the genitals before sex. For these reasons, it’s sometimes called the “feed and breed” system.

- The lungs are covered with nerves that extend to both sides of the autonomic nervous system, and many of the nerves connecting to the parasympathetic system are located in the lower lobes, which is one reason long and slow breaths are so relaxing. As molecules of breath descend deeper, they switch on parasympathetic nerves, which send more messages for the organs to rest and digest. As air ascends through the lungs during exhalation, the molecules stimulate an even more powerful parasympathetic response. The deeper and more softly we breathe in, and the longer we exhale, the more slowly the heart beats and the calmer we become. People have evolved to spend the majority of waking hours—and all of our sleeping hours—in this state of recovery and relaxation. Chilling out helped make us human.

- nerves. These work like 911 calls. The more messages the system gets, the bigger the emergency. That negative energy you feel when someone cuts you off in traffic or wrongs you at work is the sympathetic system ramping up. In these states, the body redirects blood flow from less-vital organs like the stomach and bladder and sends it to the muscles and brain. Heart rate increases, adrenaline kicks in, blood vessels constrict, pupils dilate, palms sweat, the mind sharpens. Sympathetic states help ease pain and keep blood from draining out if we get injured. They make us meaner and leaner, so we can fight harder or run faster when confronted with danger. But our bodies are built to stay in a state of heightened sympathetic alert only for short bursts, and only on occasion.

- The stress-inducing breathing method that brought me to this roadside public park is called Inner Fire Meditation, and it’s been practiced by Tibetan Buddhists and their students for the past thousand years. Its history begins around the tenth century AD, when a 28-year-old Indian man named Naropa got bored with domestic life. He divorced his wife, packed a bag, and walked northeast until he was surrounded by stone towers, pavilions, temples, and blue lotus. This dazzling place was Buddhist University Nalanda, and thousands… ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2226))

- Naropa excelled in his courses, mastering the lessons of Sutra and the secret techniques of Tantra, which had been handed down from one master to another over the millennia. He set out into the Himalayas to put everything he’d learned into practice, living inside a cave on the banks of the Bagmati River in what is now Kathmandu, Nepal. The cave was cold. Naropa harnessed the power of his breath to keep himself from freezing to death. The practice became known as Tummo, the Tibetan word for “inner fire.” Tummo was dangerous. If used incorrectly, it could elicit intense surges of energy, which could cause serious mental harm. For that reason, it was reserved only for advanced monks and stayed in the Himalayas, locked up in the Tibetan monasteries for the next thousand years. Fast-forward to the early 1900s, when a Belgian-French… ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2232))

As a teenager, she’d hung out with mystics, starved herself, beaten herself, and followed diets used by ascetic saints. She was into Freemasonry and feminism and free love. But it was Buddhism that really fascinated her. She taught herself Sanskrit, then set out on a spiritual pilgrimage through India and Tibet that lasted 14 years. Along the way she happened into a cave high in the Himalayas, just as Naropa had done. It was there that a Tibetan holy man passed down the instructions for the superheating power of Tummo. “[Tummo was] but a way devised by the Thibetan hermits of enabling themselves to live without endangering their health on the high hills,” wrote David-Néel. “It has nothing to do with religion, and so it can be used for ordinary purposes… ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2239))

- But there is another, less invasive way Porges found to stimulate the vagus nerve: breathing. Breathing is an autonomic function we can consciously control. While we can’t simply decide when to slow or speed up our heart or digestion, or to move blood from one organ to another, we can choose how and when to breathe. Willing ourselves to breathe slowly will open up communication along the vagal network and relax us into a parasympathetic state. Breathing really fast and heavy on purpose flips the vagal response the other way, shoving us into a stressed state. It teaches us to consciously access the autonomic nervous system and control it, to turn on heavy stress specifically so that we can turn it off and spend the rest of our days ([Location 2292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2292))

They told stories of monks wearing nothing but a single layer of clothes throughout the winter, heating themselves in frigid stone monasteries by day and melting circles in the snow around their bare bodies by night. Eventually, a Harvard Medical School researcher named Herbert Benson thought it might be time to put Tummo to the test. Benson flew to the Himalayas in 1981, recruited three monks, hooked them up to sensors that measured the temperature in their fingers and toes, and then asked them to practice Tummo breathing. During the practice, the temperature in the monks’ extremities went up by as much as 17 degrees Fahrenheit and stayed there.

That would change by the early 2000s, when a Dutch man named Wim Hof ran a half-marathon through the snow above the Arctic Circle shirtless and in bare feet. Here was a Westerner who had a beard, thinning lead-colored hair, and a face pulled from a Bruegel painting. In short, he looked like every other middle-aged Northern European male. Hof hadn’t grown up in a cave in India or suffered from tuberculosis in a village hospital. He’d worked as a mail carrier and was a father of four. Years earlier, Hof’s wife had taken her own life after years of depression. He had sought refuge from his pain by deepening his practice of yoga, meditation, and breathing practices.

Then he ran a full marathon in the Namib desert in temperatures that reached 104, without ever sipping a drop of water. Over the span of a decade, Hof broke 26 world records, each more baffling than the last. These stunts earned him international fame, and his smiling, frost-covered face soon appeared on dozens of magazine covers, in flashy documentary specials, and in a handful of books. “Wim violated the rules laid out in medical textbooks so drastically scientists had to pay attention,” said Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology at Stanford University.

In 2011, researchers at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands brought Hof into a laboratory and started poking and prodding him, trying… ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2322))

A few minutes later, he rose from the chair and got a cup of coffee. Hof insisted he wasn’t special; neither were David-Néel or the Tibetan monks. Almost anyone could do what they all did. As Hof put it, we just had to “Breathe, motherfucker!” He proved his point three years later, when Radboud University researchers brought in two dozen healthy male volunteers and randomly split them into two groups. Half the men spent the next ten days learning Hof’s version of Tummo while exposing themselves to cold, doing things like playing soccer shirtless in snow. The control group received no training. The two groups were brought back into the lab. Each was hooked up to monitors, then injected with the E. coli endotoxin. The group trained by Hof were able to control their heart rate, temperature, and immune response, and stimulate the sympathetic system. This practice of heavy breathing along with regular cold exposure was later discovered to release the stress hormones adrenaline, cortisol, and norepinephrine on command. The burst of adrenaline gave heavy breathers energy and released a battery of immune cells programmed to heal wounds, fight off pathogens and infection. The huge spike in cortisol helped downgrade short-term inflammatory immune responses, while a… ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2330))

In simple terms, these diseases are the result of an immune system that goes rogue and starts attacking healthy tissues. Joints become inflamed, muscles and nerve fibers waste away, rashes cover the skin. These ailments go by many names: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Hashimoto’s disease, type 1 diabetes. Pharmaceutical treatments, such as immunosuppressants, work by easing symptoms and keeping the patient more comfortable, but they do nothing to address the core malfunction in the body. Autoimmune diseases have no known cure, and even the causes are debated. An increasing body of research has shown that many are tied to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.

That night McGee tried Wim Hof’s heavy breathing technique. “For the first time in a long time, I slept peacefully,” he told me. He signed up for Hof’s ten-week video course, and within weeks watched as his insulin levels normalized, pain subsided, and blood pressure plunged. He quit taking enalapril and reduced his insulin intake by around 80 percent. He still took ibuprofen, but only a pill or two once a week. McGee was hooked. He flew to Poland to attend an instructor retreat with Hof, where he and a dozen other students spent two weeks hiking up snowy mountains and swimming in freezing lakes. They breathed a lot. It never felt like a competition, McGee told me, or like some extreme fitness regimen. “Fight it. No pain, no gain. That’s all bullshit. That’s how you get hurt,” McGee explained. The point was to rebalance the body so that it could do what it is naturally adapted to do. I’d heard dozens of these stories.

Fears weren’t just a mental problem, and they couldn’t be treated by simply getting patients to think differently. Fears and anxiety had a physical manifestation, too. They could be generated from outside the amygdalae, from within a more ancient part of the reptilian brain. Eighteen percent of Americans suffer from some form of anxiety or panic, with these numbers rising every year. Perhaps the best step in treating them, and hundreds of millions of others around the world, was by first conditioning the central chemoreceptors and the rest of the brain to become more flexible to carbon dioxide levels.

The concrete in your driveway, clothes on your body, spouse clanking dishes in your kitchen—they’re all made of swirling atomic bits. It’s energy. It’s prana. The concept of prana was first documented around the same time in India and China, some 3,000 years ago, and became the bedrock of medicine. The Chinese called it ch’i and believed the body contained channels that functioned like ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2803))

- prana power lines connecting organs and tissues. The Japanese had their own name for prana, ki, as did the Greeks (pneuma), Hebrews (ruah), Iroquois (orenda), and so on. Different names, same premise. The more prana something has, the more alive it is. Should this flow of energy ever become blocked, the body would shut down and sickness would follow. If we lose so much prana that we can’t support basic body functions, we die. Over the millennia, these cultures developed hundreds—thousands—of methods to maintain a steady flow of prana. They created acupuncture to open up prana channels and yoga postures to awaken and distribute the energy. Spicy foods contained large doses of prana, which is one of the reasons traditional Indian and Chinese diets are often hot. But the most powerful technique was to inhale prana: to breathe. Breathing techniques were so fundamental to prana that ch’i and ruah and other ancient terms for energy are synonymous with respiration. When we breathe, we expand our life force. The Chinese called their system of conscious breathing qigong: qi, meaning “breath,” and gong, meaning “work,” or, put together, breathwork.

- By the early 1970s, Swami Rama had become a bona fide breathing superstar, with his bushy eyebrows and laser-beam eyes showing up in Time, Playboy, Esquire, and, later, on daytime television talk shows like Donahue. Nobody in the Western world had seen anything like him before. But it turned out Rama wasn’t that special. A French cardiologist named Thérèse Brosse had recorded a yogi doing the same thing Rama did forty years earlier: stopping and starting his heart on demand. A researcher named M. A. Wenger, at the University of California, Los Angeles, repeated the tests and found yogis who could control not only the beat and pulse strength of their hearts but also the flow of sweat on their foreheads and the temperature of their fingertips. Swami Rama’s “superhuman” abilities weren’t superhuman at all. They’d been standard practice for hundreds of generations of Indian yogis. Rama revealed some of his secrets of prana control in group lessons and videos. He recommended students begin by harmonizing their ([Location 2849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2849))

- breathing, by removing the pause between inhalations and exhalations so that every breath was one line connected with no end. When this practice felt comfortable, he instructed them to lengthen the breaths. Once a day, they were to lie down, take a brief inhale, and then exhale to a count of 6. As they progressed, they could inhale to a count of 4 and exhale to 8, with the goal of reaching a half-minute exhale after six months of practice. Upon reaching this 30 count, Rama promised his students, they “will not have any toxins and will be disease-free.” In an instructional video, gently stroking his own arm, he said, “Your body will look like smooth body, like silk, you see?” Infusing the body with prana is simple: you just breathe. But controlling this energy and directing it took a while. Rama obviously had learned something much more powerful in the Himalayas, but as far as I could tell in his books and dozens of instructional videos, he never elaborated.

- Humans “rust” as well. As the cells in our bodies lose the ability to attract oxygen, Szent-Györgyi wrote, electrons within them will slow and stop freely interchanging with other cells, resulting in unregulated and abnormal growth. Tissues will begin “rusting” in much the same way as other materials. But we don’t call this “tissue rust.” We call it cancer. And this helps explain why cancers develop and thrive in environments of low oxygen. The best way to keep tissues in the body healthy was to mimic the reactions that evolved in early aerobic life on Earth—specifically, to flood our bodies with a constant presence of that “strong electron acceptor”: oxygen. Breathing slow, less, and through the nose balances the levels of respiratory gases in the body and sends the maximum amount of oxygen to the maximum amount of tissues so that our cells have the maximum amount of electron reactivity. “In every culture and in every medical tradition before ours, healing was accomplished by moving energy,” said Szent-Györgyi. The moving energy of electrons allows living things to stay alive and healthy for as long as possible. The ([Location 2891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2891))

- I tell DeRose about the extreme sweating, complete loss of time, and lightness I felt for days afterward. How I’d spent the last decade looking for an explanation, conducting various lab experiments, analyzing my blood gases, and scanning my brain. He sits calmly with his hands neatly folded. He’d heard it all so many times. I’d found nothing in these readouts or scientific measurements, he says, because I’ve been looking in the wrong place. It’s energy; it’s prana. What had happened was simple and common. I’d built up too much prana breathing so heavily for so long, but I hadn’t yet adapted to it. This explained the waterworks and shift of consciousness. Sudarshan is derived from two words: su, meaning “good,” and darshan, meaning “vision.” In my case, I’d had a very good vision. Ancient yogis spent thousands of years honing pranayama techniques, specifically to control this energy and distribute it throughout the body to provoke their “good visions,” toned down a notch or two. This process should take several months or years to master. Modern breathers like ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2976))

The key to Sudarshan Kriya, Tummo, or any other breathing practice rooted in ancient yoga is to learn to be patient, maintain flexibility, and slowly absorb what breathing has to offer. My initial experience with Sudarshan Kriya may have been a bit jarring, DeRose says, but it also convinced me of the sheer power of breathing. In the end, it’s what brought me here.

- We start with jiya pranayama, which involves curling the tongue to the back of the mouth and holding the breath. We run through some bhandas, a method of redirecting and holding prana inside the body by contracting muscles in the throat, abs, and other areas. Then I lie down in front of him so that I’m looking up at the white acoustic tiles on the ceiling. The final exercise I’ll be doing, he tells me, is intended to build prana in the body and focus the mind. “Concentrate on just one fluid movement from inhale to exhale,” says Pinheiro. These are the same instructions I’d heard in that Sudarshan Kriya session way back when, the same instructions I learned from Anders Olsson years later, and from Wim Hof Method instructor Chuck McGee. I know this process now; I know these ropes. I relax my throat and take a very deep inhale into the pit of my stomach, then exhale completely. Inhale again, and repeat. “All the way in and all the way out,” says Pinheiro. “Keep going! Keep breathing!” ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=2996))

- There it is, again. And here I am, again. That ringing in the ears. The heavy-metal double-bass drum thumping in my chest. The warm static flowing to my shoulders and face. The wave comes, washes over and runs up, then turns around and recedes, back to the ocean. I’ve felt this all before now, so many times. It’s the same thing the ancient people of the Indus Valley must have experienced 5,000 years ago, and the ancient Chinese 2,000 years after them. Alexandra David-Néel warmed herself with it in a cave in the Himalayas, and Swami Rama focused it on his hands and heart. Buteyko rediscovered it by a window in the asthma ward of the First Moscow Hospital, and Carl Stough taught it to dying veterans at the VA Medical Center in New Jersey. As I breathe a little faster, go a little deeper, the names of all the techniques I’ve explored over the past ten years all come back in a rush. Pranayama. Buteyko. Coherent Breathing. Hypoventilation. Breathing Coordination. Holotropic Breathwork. Adhama. Madhyama. Uttama. Kêvala. Embryonic Breath. Harmonizing Breath. The Breath by the Master Great Nothing. Tummo. Sudarshan Kriya. The names may have changed over the years, the techniques may have been repurposed and repackaged in different cultures at different times for different reasons, but they were never lost. They’ve been inside us all this time, just waiting to be tapped. They give us the means to stretch our lungs and straighten our bodies, boost blood flow, balance our minds and moods, and excite the electrons in our molecules. To sleep better, run faster, swim deeper, live longer, and evolve further. They offer a mystery and magic of life that unfolds a little more with every new breath we take.

- the nose with a big exhale can’t reverse the onset of neuromuscular genetic diseases. No breathing can heal stage IV cancer. These severe problems require urgent medical attention. I wouldn’t be alive without antibiotics, immunizations, and a last-minute rush to the doctor’s office to zap out a lymph node infection. The medical technologies developed over the last century have saved innumerable lives. They have increased the quality of life around the world many times over. But modern medicine, still, has its limitations. “I’m dealing with the walking dead,” said Dr. Michael Gelb, who’d spent 30 years working as a dental surgeon and sleep specialist. He echoed what I’d heard from Dr. Don Storey, my father-in-law, who’d worked as a pulmonologist for the past 40 years. Dozens of doctors at Harvard, Stanford, and other institutions told me the same thing. Modern medicine, they said, was amazingly efficient at cutting out and stitching up parts of the body in emergencies, but sadly deficient at treating milder, chronic systemic maladies—the asthma, headaches, stress, ([Location 3034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=3034))

- and autoimmune issues that most of the modern population contends with. These doctors explained, in so many words and in so many ways, that a middle-aged man complaining of work stress, irritable bowels, depression, and an occasional tingling in his fingers wasn’t going to get the same attention as a patient with kidney failure. He’d be prescribed a blood pressure medication and an antidepressant and sent on his way. The role of the modern doctor was to put out fires, not blow away smoke. Nobody was happy with this arrangement: doctors were frustrated that they had neither the time nor the support to prevent and treat milder chronic problems, while patients were learning that their cases weren’t dire enough for the attention they sought. This is one of the reasons I believe so many people, and so many medical researchers, have come to breathing. Like all Eastern medicines, breathing techniques are best suited to serve as preventative maintenance, a way to retain balance in the body so that milder problems don’t blossom into more serious health issues.

- The benefits of nasal breathing extended beyond the bedroom. I increased my performance on the stationary bike by about 10 percent. (Olsson had more modest gains, about 5 percent.) These results paled in comparison to the gains reported by sports training expert John Douillard, but I couldn’t imagine any athlete who wouldn’t want a 10 percent—or even a 1 percent—advantage over a competitor. On a more personal note, those first few nasal breaths after ten days of obstruction were so shimmering and rousing that I got a little teary-eyed. I thought about my interviews with all the empty nose syndrome sufferers who’d been told they were crazy, that they should just quit complaining and breathe through their mouths. I thought about kids who’d been told that chronic allergies and congestion were a part of childhood, and the adults who’d convinced themselves that choking every night was a natural part of growing old. I had felt their pain, and was lucky enough to breathe life on the other side. It’s something I’ll never forget, and will never, ever repeat.

- Carl Stough spent a half century reminding his students of how to get all the air out of our bodies so that we could take more in. He trained his clients to exhale longer and, in the process, do what had long been considered biologically impossible. Emphysemics reported almost total recovery from their incurable conditions, opera singers gained more resonance and tone in their voices, asthmatics no longer suffered from attacks, and Olympic sprinters went on to win gold medals. As basic as this sounds, full exhalations are seldom practiced. Most of us engage only a small fraction of our total lung capacity with each breath, requiring us to do more and get less.

- of the first steps in healthy breathing is to extend these breaths, to move the diaphragm up and down a bit more, and to get air out of us before taking a new one in. “The difference in breathing in the coordinated pattern and in an altered pattern is the difference between operating at peak efficiency and just getting along,” Stough wrote in the 1960s. “An engine does not have to be in tip-top condition to work, but it gives a better performance if it is.” ([Location 3105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0818ZZNLR&location=3105))

He’s finishing production on his BreathIQ, a portable device that measures nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and other chemicals in exhaled breath. Then there are other skunkworks to mimic the effects of perfect breathing: a carbon dioxide suit, a hat, and . . . Meanwhile, Google just released an app that pops up automatically when the words “breathing exercise” are searched. It trains visitors to inhale and exhale every 5.5 seconds.
