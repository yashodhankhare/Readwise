## Highlights
- I’d be startled to discover that the ancient saying of the Tao Te Ching—“The best runner leaves no tracks”—wasn’t some gossamer koan, but real, concrete, how-to, training advice. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=108))

- It’s not that I’m all that stubborn. It’s not that I’m even all that crazy about running. If I totaled all the miles I’d ever run, half were aching drudgery. But it ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=172))

- does say something that even though I haven’t read The World According to Garp in twenty years, I’ve never forgotten one minor scene, and it ain’t the one you’re thinking of: I keep thinking back to the way Garp used to burst out his door in the middle of the workday for a five-mile run. There’s something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we’re scared, we run when we’re ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.

- In terms of stress relief and sensual pleasure, running is what you have in your life before you have sex. The equipment and desire come factory installed; all you have to do is let ’er rip and hang on for the ride. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=183))

- “Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up,” Bannister said. “It knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lion or a gazelle—when the sun comes up, you’d better be running.” ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=207))

Terrible.”) Yet these guys were knocking them out a dozen at a time? ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=244))

- The Tarahumara are so mysterious, in fact, they even go by an alias. Their real name is Rarámuri—the Running People. They were dubbed “Tarahumara” by conquistadores who didn’t understand the tribal tongue. The bastardized name stuck because the Rarámuri remained true to form, running away rather than hanging around to argue the point. Answering aggression with their heels has always been the Rarámuri way. Ever since Cortés’s armored invaders came jangling into their homeland and then through subsequent invasions by Pancho Villa’s roughriders and Mexican drug barons, the Tarahumara have responded to attacks by running farther and faster than anyone could follow, retreating ever deeper into the Barrancas. God, they must be unbelievably disciplined, I thought. Total focus and dedication. The Shaolin monks of running. Well, not quite. When it comes to marathoning, the Tarahumara prefer more of a Mardi Gras approach. In terms of diet, lifestyle, and belly fire, they’re a track coach’s nightmare. They drink like New Year’s Eve is a weekly event, tossing back enough corn beer in a year to spend every third ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=251))

- day of their adult lives either buzzed or recovering. Unlike Lance, the Tarahumara don’t replenish their bodies with electrolyte-rich sports drinks. They don’t rebuild between workouts with protein bars; in fact, they barely eat any protein at all, living on little more than ground corn spiced up by their favorite delicacy, barbecued mouse. Come race day, the Tarahumara don’t train or taper. They don’t stretch or warm up. They just stroll to the starting line, laughing and bantering … then go like hell for the next forty-eight hours.

- Which made Ángel wonder if he’d ever see the Creature at all. A lot of things could kill him out there, and probably would. If the Creature didn’t know enough to keep his distance from the marijuana fields, he wouldn’t even hear the shot that took off his head. “¡Hoooooolaaaaaa! ¡Amigoooooooooos!” The mystery of the lone wanderer was solved even sooner than Ángel had expected. He was still squinting into the sun, watching out for returning schoolkids, when he heard an echoing yodel and spotted a naked guy waving and running down the trail toward the river. On closer inspection, the Creature wasn’t entirely naked. He wasn’t exactly dressed either, certainly not by Tarahumara standards. For a people who prefer not to be seen, the Tarahumara always look fantastic. The men wear bright blouses over a long white cloth bound around the groin and left hanging, skirtlike, in the front and rear. They cinch it all together with a rainbow-colored sash, and accessorize with a matching headband. Tarahumara women are even more magnificent, wearing brilliantly colored skirts and matching blouses, their lovely umber skin highlighted by coral-colored stone necklaces and bracelets. No matter what kind of fancy ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=559))

- hiking duds you’ve got on, you’re guaranteed to feel underdressed among the Tarahumara. Even by sun-crazed-prospector standards, the Creature was seriously shabby. He only had on some dirt-colored chabochi shorts, a pair of sandals, and an old baseball cap. That was it. No backpack, no shirt, and apparently no food, because as soon as he reached Ángel, he asked in awkward Spanish for agua and made shoveling gestures toward his mouth—maybe he could have something to eat? “Assag,” Ángel told him in Tarahumara, gesturing for him to sit. Someone produced a cup of pinole, the Tarahumara corn gruel. The stranger slurped it down hungrily. Between gulps, he tried to communicate. He pumped his arms and let his tongue loll like a panting dog. “¿Corriendo?” the teacher asked. You’ve been running? The Creature nodded. “Todo día,” he said in pidgin Spanish. “All day.” “¿Por qué?” Ángel asked. “¿Y a dónde?” Why? And where to? The Creature launched into a long tale, which Ángel found highly entertaining as performance art but barely intelligible as narrative. From what Ángel could make out, the lone wanderer was either totally nuts or not so lone after all; he claimed to have an even more mysterious sidekick, some kind of Apache warrior he called Ramón Chingón—“Ray, the Mean Motherfucker.” ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=568))

- “¿Y tú?” Ángel asked. “What’s your name?” “Caballo Blanco,” he said. The White Horse. “Pues, bueno,” the teacher said, shrugging. Good enough. The White Horse didn’t linger; once he’d gulped some water and a second cup of pinole, he waved good-bye and went trotting back up the trail. He stomped and shrieked like a wild stallion as he went, amusing the kids, who laughed and chased at his heels until he disappeared, once again, back into the wild. “Caballo Blanco es muy amable,” Ángel said, concluding his story, “pero un poco raro.” The White Horse is a good guy, in other words, if you like ’em a little loony. “So you think he’s still out there?” I asked. “Hombre, claro,” Ángel said. “He was here yesterday. I gave him a drink with that cup.” I looked around. There was no cup. “The cup was there, too,” Ángel insisted. From what Ángel had picked up over the years, Caballo lived in a hut he’d built himself somewhere across the Batopilas mountain. Whenever he turned up at Ángel’s school,… ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=579))

- Korima sounds like karma and functions the same way, except in the here and now. It’s your obligation to share whatever you can spare, instantly and with no expectations: once the gift leaves your hand, it was never yours to begin with. The Tarahumara have no monetary system, so korima is how they do business: their economy is based on trading favors and the occasional cauldron of corn beer. The White Horse looked and dressed and sounded nothing like the Tarahumara, but in a deeper way, he was one of them. Ángel had heard of Tarahumara runners who used the Horse’s hut as a way station during long journeys through the canyons. The Horse, in return, was always welcome to a meal and a place to rest when he came roaming through Ángel’s village on his rambling runs. Ángel waved his arm, a brusque sweep of his arm out thataway—beyond the river and the canyon top, toward non-Tarahumara country whence no good can come. “There’s a village called Mesa de la Yerbabuena,” he said. “Do you… ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=591))

- them cover a lot of distance in a day, much farther than you could get to from here.” Unfortunately, the trail was so good that the Mexican government eventually decided to slick it with asphalt and turn it into a road. Trucks began showing up in Yerbabuena, and in them, foods the Tarahumara had rarely eaten—soda, chocolate, rice, sugar, butter, flour. The people of Yerbabuena developed a taste for starch and treats, but they needed money to buy them, so instead of working their own fields, they began hitching rides to Guachochi, where they worked as dishwashers and day laborers, or selling junk crafts at the train station in Divisadero. “That was twenty years ago,” Ángel said. “Now, there are no runners in Yerbabuena.” The Yerbabuena story really scares Ángel, because now there’s talk that the government has found a way to run a road along the canyon floor and right into this settlement. Why they would put a road in here, Ángel doesn’t have a clue; the Tarahumara don’t want it, and they’re the only ones who live here. Only drug lords and illegal loggers benefit from Copper Canyon roads, which makes… ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=601))

- explorer was already warning that the Tarahumara were in danger of disappearing. “Future generations will not find any other record of the Tarahumares than what scientists of the present age can elicit from the lips of the people and from the study of their implements and customs,” he predicted. “They stand out to-day as an interesting relic of a time long gone by; as a representative of one of the most important stages in the development of the human race; as one of those wonderful primitive tribes that were the founders and makers of the history of mankind.” “There are Rarámuri who don’t respect our traditions as much as Caballo Blanco,” Ángel lamented. “El Caballo sabe—the Horse gets it.” I slumped… ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=612))

- I didn’t want to bug Caballo with questions just yet, even though listening to him was like watching an art-house film in fast forward; traumas, jokes, fantasies, flashbacks, grudges, guilt over grudges, tantalizing fragments of ancient wisdom—they all came calliope-ing past in a blur too quick and disjointed to catch. He’d tell a story, move on to the next, skip ahead to the third, go back and correct a detail in the first, gripe about the guy in the second, then apologize for griping because, man, he’d spent his life trying to control his anger, and that was another story altogether….

- His name was Micah True, he said, and he came from Colorado. Well, California, actually. And if I really wanted to understand the Rarámuri, I should have been there when this ninety-five-year-old man came hiking twenty-five ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=805))

- miles over the mountain. Know why he could do it? Because no one ever told him he couldn’t. No one ever told him he oughta be off dying somewhere in an old age home. You live up to your own expectations, man. Like when he named himself after his dog. That’s where the name “True” really came from, his old dog. He didn’t always measure up to good old True Dog, but that was another story, too…. I waited, scraping at the label of my beer bottle with a fingernail, wondering if he’d ever simmer down enough for me to figure out what the hell he was talking about. Gradually, Caballo’s spoonwork slowed and came to a stop. He drained his second bottle of Tecate and sat back, satisfied. “Guadajuko!” he said with a toothy grin. “Good word to learn. That’s Rarámuri for ‘cool.’ ” I pushed a third Tecate across the table. He eyed it with that skeptical, sun-scorched squint. “I don’t know, man,” he said. “Not eating ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=807))

- all day, I can’t hold it like the Rarámuri.” But he picked it up and took a sip. Thirsty work, rambling up sky-scraping mesas. He took a long, chugging pull, then relaxed way back in his chair, tipping the front legs up and lacing his fingers across his lean belly. Something had just clicked inside him; I could tell before he even said another word. Maybe he needed those last twelve ounces of beer to loosen up, or maybe he’d just had to blow out some pent-up steam before relaxing into his story. Because when Caballo started to talk this time, he kept me spellbound. He talked deep into the night, telling an amazing story that spanned the ten years since his disappearance from the outside world and was full of bizarre characters, amazing adventures, and furious fights. And, in the end, a plan. An audacious plan. A plan, I gradually realized, that involved me. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0028MBKVG&location=814))

- “There are two goddesses in your heart,” he told them. “The Goddess of Wisdom and the Goddess of Wealth. Everyone thinks they need to get wealth first, and wisdom will come. So they concern themselves with chasing money. But they have it backwards. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous, and follow you.” Ask nothing from your running, in other words, and you’ll get more than you ever imagined.
