## Highlights
- Munger is such an interesting person, in no small part because he is, in a word, unrestrained. He says exactly what is on his mind, with little consideration ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010EB3EUM&location=69))

- People sometimes say to me that they do not understand the fuss about Charlie Munger. Unfortunately, they are missing a key point: no one can ever be Charlie Munger, just like no one can be Warren Buffett. The point is not to treat anyone like a hero, but rather to consider whether Munger, like his idol ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010EB3EUM&location=75))

- Benjamin Franklin, may have qualities, attributes, systems, or approaches to life that we might want to emulate, even in part. This same process explains why Munger has read hundreds of biographies. Learning from the success and failure of others is the fastest way to get smarter and wiser without a lot of pain.

- Much of what is interesting about Munger is explained by this simple sentence: “I observe what works and what doesn’t and why.” Life happens to Munger as it does to everyone, but unlike many people he thinks deeply about why things happen and works hard to ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010EB3EUM&location=84))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When confronted with this idea, people will often ask, “Do you mean Graham value investors wait for mispriced assets to appear rather than predict the future in the short term?” The answer is an emphatic yes! The Graham value investor’s job is to recognize mispriced assets when he or she sees them. This approach is hard for many people to accept. At the core of the system is the idea that the investor must let go of his or her desire to make short-term predictions about the future. Some people just can’t do that. Klarman wrote: The value discipline seems simple enough but is apparently a difficult one for most investors to grasp or adhere to.

- Successfully learning and especially implementing the Graham value investing system is what Munger has called “a trained response.” You must learn to overcome certain behavior that drives poor decisions. If you can do that successfully, Munger believes you can create an investing edge over other investors. Part of that trained response is to avoid distracting noise made by people who do not understand investing or who have a financial interest in keeping you from understanding investing. The task is made vastly harder by people who generate their income by making the investing process overly complex and harvesting their living from the psychological and emotional dysfunctions of investors. Munger told a story about the incentives... of investment managers that is instructive: I think the reason why we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle. I asked him, “My God, they’re purple and green.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Who is a “know-nothing” investor? The answer is simple for Munger: a know-nothing investor is someone who does not understand fundamentals of investing. Here is a simple suggestion from Seth Klarman for no-nothing investors: “If you can’t beat the market, be the market.”8 ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010EB3EUM&location=361))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- limitations, it ceases to be dumb.”9 What Buffett was talking about is the question of whether a person should be an active or a passive investor—concepts he learned from Benjamin Graham. Passive investors are not completely passive because they still have choices to make. For example, passive investors must make asset allocation decisions (i.e., which types of investments to make) and determine what types of indexes to ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010EB3EUM&location=366))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- use within those asset classes. When making these choices, investors can still make emotional and psychological errors. Even though passive investors must make some decisions, they are called passive because they do not make as many decisions as active investors. A better approach is perhaps to call these passive investors index investors.

- long as people remember that gambling is, well, gambling. Knowing the difference between gambling and investing is important. Investing is an action that defers consumption in the present in the hope that you will be able to consume more in the future. An investor has an expectation of a positive real rate of return, even though it is possible that this will not happen (especially in the short term).

There’s no way to squeeze you in.” After thinking a moment, the prospector asked if he might say just four words to the present occupants.

- investors liked the results they saw on the statements from Madoff so much that they went into a state of psychological denial. Even a professor who wrote a scholarly book on gullibility was an investor in the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. A common example of psychological denial happens when people make projections about a potential investment. Weirdly, sometimes the fewer facts there are to support a well-told story, the more believable it may be for certain investors. Only when real facts start to appear do these people start to question the story. Daniel Kahneman pointed this out: “It’s all too easy to tell stories that make sense of one’s life in retrospect.”10 This is why it’s particularly dangerous to short a so-called story stock.

Moreover, as perception goes, so goes cognition. The result is man’s Contrast-Misreaction Tendency. Few psychological tendencies do more damage to correct thinking. Small-scale damages involve instances such as man’s buying an overpriced $1,000 leather dashboard merely because the price is so low compared to his concurrent purchase of a $65,000 car.
