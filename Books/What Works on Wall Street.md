## Highlights
- The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word “crisis.” One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger—but recognize the opportunity. —John F. Kennedy ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=100))

- As we will see in Chapters Two and Three, investors seem to be programmed by nature to fail at investing, forever chasing the asset class that has turned in the best performance recently and heavily discounting anything that occurred more than three to five years ago.

- The whole purpose of What Works on Wall Street is to dissuade investors from this course of action. Only the fullness of time shows which investment strategies are the best long-term performers, and this is doubly true after the last decade’s sorry performance. You will see that after we review the results of the various strategies, investors who diligently stuck with the best long-term strategies did significantly better than those who followed a hit and miss approach to investing.

- HIGHLIGHTS After reading What Works on Wall Street, investors will know that:   • Most small-capitalization strategies owe their superior returns to microcap stocks that have market capitalizations below $25 million. These stocks are too small for almost all investors to actually buy, making their returns on paper an illusion. That is why we cover stocks only with… ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=261))

- Stocks with the worst price momentum are horrible long-term performers; the only time these stocks do well is in the first year after a severe (−40 percent or more) bear market when “junk” rallies have always occurred. • Single value factors have vastly better returns and batting averages than pure growth factors. The one exception to this is price momentum, and even here it should always be used in connection with a value constraint. • Using several value factors together in a composited value factor offers much better and more consistent returns than using individual value factors on their own. • Accounting variables such as accruals to price, asset turnover, external financing, and percentage change in debt offer key insights into which stocks have higher-quality earnings. This translates directly into better performance for those stocks with higher-quality earnings and much lower returns for stocks with lower-quality earnings. Indeed, we have found that using several accounting variables together—total accruals to total assets, percentage change in net operating assets, total accruals to average assets, and depreciation expense to capital expense—dramatically improves the quality of stocks you are focusing on and also the return. • The two least risky sectors—consumer staples and utilities—can nevertheless offer investors excellent returns at low levels of risk by focusing on composited value factors and shareholder yield. You’ll find the results in Chapter Twenty-Four for a 50-stock portfolio from these two conservative sectors that nevertheless provides market-beating results with a much lower risk than the overall market. • The poorest performing sector, returning an average annual compound return of 7.29 percent over the full period of our study, is also one of the most popular—information technologies. • There are several large capitalization strategies that consistently beat the market while taking lower risks. • Buying Wall Street’s current darlings with the… ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=266))

- Thus, for all 10-year periods since 1991, 70 percent of actively managed funds failed to beat the S&P 500 over previous 10-year periods. What’s more, this record overstates traditionally managed active fund performance, because it doesn’t include all the funds that failed to survive for a 10-year period. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=322))

- Conventional academics aren’t surprised that traditionally-managed funds fail to beat the market. Most have long held that markets are efficient and that current security prices reflect all available information; they argue that prices follow a random walk and move without rhyme or reason. According to their theories, you might as well have a monkey throw darts at a stock page as attempt security analysis because stock prices are random and cannot be predicted. Yet the long-term evidence in this book contradicts the random walk theory. Far from following a random walk, the evidence continues to reveal a purposeful stride. The 46 years of data found in this edition proves strong return predictability. Indeed, the CRSP data included in this edition extends this to 83 years of historical data. What’s more, this return predictability continues to persist even since the first edition of this book was published in 1996. The market clearly and consistently rewards certain attributes (e.g., stocks with low price-to-earnings, price-to-cash ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=343))

- to-cash flow, and price-to-sales ratios) and clearly and consistently punishes others (e.g., stocks with high price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow, and price-to-sales ratios) over long periods of time and over many market cycles. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=350))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Yet the paradox remains: if past historical tests—as well as the real-time results that were generated with the strategies featured in this book since its initial publication—show such high return predictability, why do 70 percent of traditionally managed mutual funds continually fail to beat the S&P 500 over long periods of time? Finding exploitable investment opportunities does not mean that it is easy to make money, however. To do so requires the ability to consistently, patiently, and slavishly stick with the strategy, even when it is performing poorly relative to other methods. One of the central themes of this book is that all strategies have performance cycles in which they over- and underperform their relevant benchmarks. The key to outstanding long-term performance is to find strategies that have the highest base rate, or batting average (more on that later), and then stick with that strategy, even when it’s underperforming other strategies and benchmarks. Few people are capable of such action. Successful investors do not comply with nature; they defy it. Most investors react very emotionally to the short-term gyrations of the market, and I’ve seen many who follow my strategies and portfolios in real time say, “Well, the strategies used to work, but they don’t anymore,” after just a few months of underperformance. Indeed, history documents several periods in which factors have inverted, with the long-term factor that normally produces outstanding results being walloped by the factor that has historically led to disastrous results. What appears dull and boring in a long-term compilation of factor returns becomes emotional and frightening when investors live through it in real time, leading to doubt as to whether the long-term results will somehow change. Our very human nature leads us to believe that we live in unique times in which the lessons from the past no longer apply. Generation after generation has shared this outlook, and by ignoring the lessons of the past, each generation has repeated the same mistakes of its predecessors. In the next chapter, I argue that the reason traditional management doesn’t work well is that decision making is systematically flawed and unreliable. This provides an opportunity to those of us who use rational, disciplined methods to buy and sell stocks using time-tested methods to do much better than a simple index like the S&P 500, essentially allowing the disciplined investor to arbitrage human nature.

- STUDYING THE WRONG THINGS It is no surprise that academics find traditionally managed stock portfolios following a random walk. The past records of most traditional managers cannot be predictive of future returns because their behavior is inconsistent. You cannot make forecasts based on inconsistent behavior, because when you behave inconsistently, you are unpredictable. Even if the manager is a perfectly consistent investor—a hallmark of the best money managers—if that manager leaves the fund, all predictive ability from past performance of the fund is lost. Moreover, if a manager changes his or her style, all predictive ability from past performance is also lost. Traditional academics, therefore, have been measuring the wrong things. They assumed perfect, rational behavior in a capricious environment ruled by greed, hope, and fear. They have been contrasting the returns of a passively held portfolio—the S&P 500—with the returns of portfolios managed in an inconsistent, shoot from the hip style. Track records are worthless unless you know what strategy the manager uses and if it is still being used. When you study traditionally… ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=386))

- Indexing to the S&P 500 works because it sidesteps flawed decision making and automates the simple strategy of buying the big stocks that make up the S&P 500. The mighty S&P 500 consistently beat 70 percent of traditionally managed funds over the long term by doing nothing more than making a disciplined bet on large capitalization stocks. Figure 1.2 compares the returns of the S&P 500 with those of our Large Stocks universe, which consists of all the stocks in the Compustat database that have market capitalizations greater than the database… ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=398))

- are then bought in equal dollar amounts. The returns are virtually identical. $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 of December 31, 1926, was worth $23,171,851 on December 31, 2009, a compound return of 9.78 percent. The same $10,000 invested in our Large Stocks universe was worth $21,617,372, a compound return of 9.69 percent. (Both include the reinvestment of all dividends.) And it’s not just the absolute returns that are so similar. Risk, as measured by the standard deviation of return, is also virtually identical for the two strategies. The S&P 500 had an annual standard deviation of return of 19.27 percent, whereas the Large Stocks universe had 19.35 percent. And remember that… ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=403))

- Thus, far from being “the market,” the S&P 500’s returns are the result of a simple strategy that says, “Buy big stocks.” The reason this works so well is that the S&P 500 never varies from this strategy. It doesn’t wake up in the morning and say, “You know, small-cap stocks have been doing well recently. I think I will change and become a… ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=411))

- “Yikes! Today I’m going to become the S&P cash and bond index!” It just continues to passively implement the strategy of buying big stocks, and that’s why it’s so effective. The S&P 500 beats 70 percent of conventionally managed funds because it never varies from its underlying strategy of buying large-capitalization stocks. It never panics, has second thoughts, or is envious when other indexes outperform it. The key to its long-term success is its unwavering disciplined implementation of an investment strategy. Yet, indexing to the S&P 500 is just one form of a passive implementation of a strategy, in this case consistently buying big stocks. As you will see in later chapters, the S&P 500’s long-term results are fairly mediocre, coming in the bottom third of all strategies we tested. There are numerous strategies that do vastly better than the S&P 500 over long periods of time. One example is called “Dogs of the Dow,” which simply buys the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year. This is a great example of another strategy that works consistently over the long term. From 1928—when the Dow Jones Industrial was expanded to 30 stocks—through 2009, the strategy consistently beat the S&P 500. Indeed, it beat the S&P 500 in almost… ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=414))

- If you use a one-factor model based on market capitalization—as in the examples above—you get the same results as the seemingly mighty S&P 500. If, however, you change a portfolio’s underlying factors so that they deviate significantly from the S&P 500, say by keeping price-to-sales ratios below one or dividend yields above a certain number, you can expect the portfolio to perform very differently from the market.

- In a study for my book Invest Like the Best, I found that the one thing that unites the best managers is consistency. I am not alone. In the 1970s, AT&T did a study of its pension fund managers and found that successful investing requires, at a minimum, a structured decision-making process that can be easily defined and a stated investment philosophy that is consistently applied. John Neff, the long-time manager of the Windsor Fund, and Peter Lynch, of the Magellan Fund, became legends because their success was the result of slavish devotion to their investment strategies. The turmoil of the market crash between October 2007 and February 2009, when stocks plunged at a faster and steeper rate than at any time other than the early 1930s, led many investors to abandon their underlying approach to investing—which I believe will ultimately cause grave damage to their long-term performance. It’s virtually impossible to remain stoic in the face of such market activity, but the consistent application of a time-tested investment strategy is the only way to ensure superior long-term results.

- There is, however, one fund that I could find that truly stuck to its underlying investment strategy—the ING Corporate Leaders Trust (Ticker LEXCX). It’s unusual in that it was set up as a unit investment trust and is a good example of a structured portfolio in action. Formed in 1935—during the depths of the Great Depression—the trust was designed to hold 30 stocks that its creators felt were the leading companies in their industry. The fund’s portfolio is share-weighted, ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=479))

    - Note: Share weighted portfolios
- weighted, holding the same number of shares in each company regardless of price. Since 1935, 9 companies have been eliminated and or combined with others, so the portfolio currently holds just 21 stocks. You’ll know every name in the portfolio—including ExxonMobil; Procter & Gamble; AT&T; General Electric, and Dow Chemical. Yet this single-factor portfolio is a market-slayer—since its inception in 1935, the fund has done significantly better than the S&P 500 and the average large stock value mutual fund, as well as besting the vast majority of traditionally managed funds. A review of the data at Morningstar.com shows that the fund is doing significantly better than both the S&P 500 and the average Morningstar Large Value category. Over the five years ending March 31, 2010, the fund is 1.17 percent ahead of the S&P 500 and 2.02 percent ahead of the average Large Value fund in the Morningstar universe. This performance put it ahead of 85 percent of its peers in the large value universe over the previous five years! The 10-year numbers are equally compelling. For the 10 years ending March 31, 2010, the fund is 5.66 percent ahead of the S&P 500 and 2.66 percent ahead of the average large value mutual fund covered by Morningstar. Finally, over the previous 15 years, the fund is 1.05 percent ahead of the S&P 500 and 1.68 percent ahead of the average Large Value fund in Morningstar, putting it ahead of 82 percent of its peers in the Morningstar Large Value universe. What’s more, its charter prevents rebalancing the portfolio, which would allow it to reflect changes in corporate leadership since 1935. Imagine how it would have done with some of today’s corporate leaders like Microsoft and Intel! ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=483))

- Knowing and doing are two very different things. As Goethe said, “In the realm of ideas, everything depends on enthusiasm; in the real world, all rests on perseverance.” While we may intellectually understand what we should do, we usually are overwhelmed by our nature, allowing the intensely emotional present to overpower our better judgment. When someone questioned the general secretary of the former Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, about actions he had taken against his better judgment, he replied, “Your question is academic because it is abstract. People don’t have the luxury of living in the abstract. They live in the real, emotional, full-blooded world of reality.” ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=496))

- Psychologists have shown in numerous studies that when people are confronted with vast amounts of data, their brains create mental shortcuts to help them make decisions.

- dilemma. Models beat the human forecasters because they reliably and consistently apply the same criteria time after time. In almost every instance, it is the total reliability of application of the model that accounts for its superior performance. Models never vary. They are always consistent. They are never moody, never fight with their spouse, are never hung over from a night on the town, and never get bored. They don’t favor vivid, interesting stories over reams of statistical data. They never take anything personally. They don’t have egos. They’re not out to prove anything. If they were people, they’d be the death of any party. People, on the other hand, are far more interesting. It’s far more natural to react emotionally or to personalize the problem than it is to dispassionately review broad statistical occurrences—and so much more fun! It’s much more natural for us to look at the limited set of our personal experiences and then generalize from this small sample to create a rule-of-thumb heuristic. We are a bundle of inconsistencies, and although this tends to make us interesting, it plays havoc with our ability to successfully invest our money. In most instances, money managers, like the college administrators, doctors, and accountants mentioned above, favor the intuitive method of forecasting. They all follow the same path: analyze the company, interview the management, talk to customers and competitors, and so on. Most, if not all, money managers think that they have the superior insights and intelligence they need to help them to pick winning stocks, yet 70 percent of them are routinely outperformed by the S&P 500.

- Each of us, it seems, believes that we are above average. Sadly, this cannot be true statistically. Yet, in tests of people’s belief in their own ability—typically people are asked to rank their ability as drivers—virtually everyone puts his or her own ability in the upper 10 to 20 percent. It may be tempting to dismiss this as a foible that highly trained professionals would not stumble into. Yet, as Professor Nick Bostrom of Oxford University points out in his paper Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards, “Bias seems to be present even among highly educated people. According to one survey, almost half of all sociologists believed that they would become one of the top ten in their field, and 94% of sociologists thought they were better at their jobs than their average colleagues.” In his 1998 paper The Psychology of the Nonprofessional Investor, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman says, “The biases of judgment and decision making have… ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=571))

Kahneman also points out that the reason it is so difficult for investors to correct their false beliefs is that they also suffer from hindsight bias, a condition that he described thus: “Psychological evidence indicates people can rarely reconstruct, after the fact, what they thought about the probability of an event before it occurred. Most are honestly deceived when they exaggerate their earlier estimate of the probability that the event would occur . . . because of another hindsight bias, events that the best informed experts did not anticipate often appear almost inevitable after they occur.” If Kahneman’s insight seems hard to… ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=580))

- BASE RATES ARE BORING Many investors, as well as anyone else using traditional, intuitive forecasting methods, are overwhelmed by their human nature. They use information unreliably, at one point including a stock in a portfolio and at another time excluding it, even though in each instance the information about the stock is the same. Our decision making is systematically flawed because we prefer gut reactions and individual, colorful stories to boring base rates. Base rates are among the most illuminating statistics that exist. They’re just like batting averages. For example, if a town of 100,000 people had 70,000 lawyers and 30,000 engineers, the base rate for lawyers would be 70 percent. When used in the stock market, these rates tell you what to expect from a certain class of stocks (e.g., all stocks with high dividend yields) and what that variable shows for how that category of stocks has performed over many ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=607))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- decades of data. We have found that since the original publication of this book in 1996, the performance of the various factors we studied has persisted. Remember that the base rates tell you nothing about how each individual member of that class will behave. Rather they indicate how all stocks with high dividend yields—or whatever factor is being reviewed—will behave. Most statistical prediction techniques use base rates. For example, 75 percent of university students with grade-point averages above 3.50 go on to do well in graduate school; smokers are twice as likely to get cancer; the average 70-year-old in the United States can expect, based on actuarial tables, to live another 13½ years; stocks with low PE ratios outperformed the market in 99 percent of all rolling 10-year periods between 1964 and 2009. The best way to predict the future is to bet with the base rate that is derived from a large sample. Yet numerous studies have found that people make full use of base rate information only when there is a lack of descriptive data. In one example, people are told that out of a sample of 100 people, 70 are lawyers and 30 are engineers. When provided with no additional information and asked to guess the occupation of a randomly selected 10, people use the base rate information, saying that all 10 are lawyers, by doing so they ensure themselves of getting the most right. However, when worthless yet descriptive data were added, such as, “Dick is a highly motivated 30-year-old married man who is well liked by his colleagues,” people largely ignored the base rate information in favor of ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=614))

- be extended coverage because the agent’s gut feeling was that this individual is different, despite what actuarial tables say. The company would lose millions in additional payouts. The reason life insurance companies are so profitable, however, is that they base coverage and premiums solely on what the actuarial tables tell them. Actuarial tables are developed using huge databases of human mortality statistics based on underlying characteristics such as weight, family history of disease, blood work, blood pressure, smoking and drinking habits, and prior history. They tell you what to expect the central tendencies of a large group will be. If you are 33 years old, have no family history of heart disease or cancer, are a nonsmoker and moderate drinker, have normal blood pressure and excellent blood work, your chances of being extended life insurance at a low rate are excellent. Why? Because the mortality tables say that it is highly unlikely for you to die anytime soon. Does this mean that the life insurance companies will make money on all 33-year-olds? No. There will be rare instances where a freak accident kills some of these healthy young people, but the vast majority of them will go on living and paying their premiums to the life insurance company. The same thing happens when we think in terms of individual stocks, rather than stock selection strategies. A case-by-case approach wreaks havoc with returns, because it virtually guarantees that many of our choices will, at least partially, include our emotions. This is a highly unreliable, unsystematic way to buy stocks, yet it’s the most natural and the most common. In the 13 years since the initial publication of this book, I have given hundreds of presentations about its findings. I always see people nodding their heads when I tell them that low price-to-sales stocks do vastly better than stocks with high price-to-sales. They agree because this is a simple fact, and it makes intuitive sense to them that paying less for every dollar of sales should lead to higher returns than paying more for every dollar of sales. But when I give them some of the actual names of stocks that meet these criteria, their demeanor visibly changes. Hands will go up with statements like, “What a dog,” or, “I hate that industry,” simply because we have now provided them with specific individual stocks about which they may have ingrained prejudices. Combating these personal feelings, even when we are aware of the bias, is a very difficult task indeed. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=644))

- Investors looking to beat the market face a very daunting task. One study by John Bogle of Vanguard found that for the 20 years ending 2003, the S&P 500 returned 13 percent per year, while the average mutual fund returned just 10.3 percent and the average investor enjoyed just a 7.9 percent annualized return. The track record is so poor, in fact, that it seems feasible that those who do beat the market are simply lucky. The predominant explanation behind this poor rate of success is that markets are rational and efficient—meaning that prices always accurately reflect all publicly known information and therefore outsmarting the market is not possible. It is convenient for economic theorists to assume rational investor behavior because it makes the modeling of markets easier. A market that is efficient is one that lacks opportunity for outperformance, which seems to sync with Bogle’s findings. Yet, the data in this book consistently demonstrate exploitable investment opportunities that have persisted even after becoming widely known.

Table 4.1 shows how I created the deflated minimums. The second group includes larger, better-known stocks with market capitalizations greater than the database average (usually the top 17 percent of the database by market capitalization). These larger stocks are called “Large Stocks” throughout this book. Table 4.2 shows the number of stocks with market capitalizations above the database mean.

- In all cases, I remove the smallest stocks in the database from consideration. For example, at the end of 2009, of the 6,705 stocks in our dataset, more than 2,555 stocks were jettisoned because their market capitalization fell below an inflation-adjusted minimum of $200 million. In the same year, only 651 stocks had market capitalizations exceeding the database average. We also remove stocks that appear in the Compustat but have no market capitalization, duplicate issues, shares of mutual funds, and the like. I originally chose a $150 million value in 1995 (now an inflation-adjusted $200 million) after consulting traders at several large Wall Street brokerages. They felt that it was the minimum necessary if they were investing $100 million in a large portfolio of stocks in 1995. Because of inflation, the number now stands at $200 million. I use this figure to avoid micro-cap stocks and focus only on those stocks ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=1356))

The same $200 million deflated back to 1926 was the equivalent of a $16.8 million. Eliminating microcap stocks considerably reduces the returns for several of the factors we study.

First, in an era of quarterly financial reporting, forming portfolios only once a year ignores a significant amount of new information that emerges over the course of any given year. The same model will select a variety of different securities throughout the year based on changing quarterly financial statement information. Second, by forming portfolios only in December, the results may have seasonal biases. The reality is that investors invest continually throughout the year, not just on December 31. To address these two issues, and thereby gain an even stronger understanding of our factors and strategies, we are now compositing all of our results. To do this, we form 12 separate portfolios each year for each strategy, one every month, and then we average the results of each of the 12 to… ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=1381))

A 1 percent absolute advantage doesn’t compensate for the terror of the wild ride. I use the well-known Sharpe ratio of reward-to-risk for my calculations, with higher numbers indicating better risk-adjusted returns. To arrive at the Sharpe ratio, simply take the average return from a strategy, subtract the risk-free rate of interest (we use a constant 5 percent risk-free rate of interest which allows us to compare strategies over all subperiods with a consistent risk-free interest rate), and then divide that number by the standard deviation of return.

- For the same five years ending February 2000, the stocks with the highest PE ratios had a cumulative five-year return of 259 percent, more than doubling the return for the low PE group. Such dazzling short-term performance clouded many investors’ minds and blinded them to the long-term truth—stocks with very high PE ratios are almost never a good investment and tend to perform well only at the end of unsustainable bubbles. Indeed, as we saw in the study featured in Chapter Three, when investors witness strong short-term performance, their dopamine goes crazy, but just as ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=1850))

- neutral to a company’s capital structure and capital expenditures. Stocks that have very high debt levels often have low PE ratios, but this does not necessarily mean that they are cheap in relation to other securities. Stocks that are highly leveraged tend to have far more volatile PE ratios than those that are not. A stock’s PE ratio is greatly affected by debt levels and tax rates, whereas its EBITDA/EV is not. To compare valuations on a level playing field, you need to account for how a company is financing itself and then compare how relatively cheap or expensive it is after accounting for all balance sheet items. You calculate EBITDA by looking at a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This offers you an approximation of the firm’s operating cash flow. You calculate enterprise value by taking the common equity at market value and then adding debt, minority interest, and preferred equity at market value. From this you subtract any associate company at market value and all cash and cash equivalents.

We define free cash flow as net cash flow minus capital expenditures, dividends, and preferred dividends.

That broader scope improves the results of certain factors like PE ratio, where focusing on all available months yields better results than simply looking at the 50 stocks with ([Location 2594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=2594))

While directionally the results remain the same—stocks with low PEs, low EBITDA/EV low price-to-cash flows and low PSRs do vastly better than those with high valuations—it is still troubling to see a few bad years change the relative return of a factor over a 46-year period.

Granted, we faced market conditions more similar to the crash of 1929–1932 than we had ever seen previously, but the ability of a single factor like PSR—especially concentrated into the 50 names with the lowest ratios—to be so affected by six years led me to conclude that we must work toward a more broadly inclusive composited value factor ([Location 2606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=2606))

Looking at Table 10.4, we see that almost all of the damage done to the stocks from All Stocks with the lowest price-to-book value ratios was done during the Great Depression. Between 1927 and 1939, the stocks in decile 1—the 10 percent of stocks from All Stocks with the lowest price-to-book value ratios—actually lost 6.55 percent per year, whereas stocks in decile 9—those stocks from All Stocks with the second-highest price-to-book value ratios actually gained 4.78 percent per year.

Thus, if a company pays an annual dividend of $1.00 and the current price of the stock is $10.00, the dividend yield is 10 percent.

- People who favor stocks with high dividend yields often pay close attention to how much of a company’s earnings are being paid out in dividends. The reasonable assumption is that stocks that payout a great deal of their earnings in the form of dividends might not perform as well as those that choose instead to reinvest in the company’s business. While I do not have payout data in the CRSP dataset, when studying stocks with high-dividend yields, I do have the data in the Compustat dataset, starting in 1963. A review of the returns for stocks based upon the payout ratio finds that the middle deciles do the best—specifically deciles 5, 6, and 7.

The fifth decile by payout ratio performed the best.

- Net operating assets (NOA) are a company’s operating assets minus operating liabilities. You derive them by separating operating activity from financing activity to isolate the operating performance of a company and not its gains from financing activities. In their paper “Do Investors Overvalue Firms with Bloated Balance Sheets?” David Hirshleifer, Kewei Hou, Siew Hong Teoh, and Yinglei Zhang state, “When cumulative net operating income (accounting value-added) outstrips cumulative free cash flow (cash value-added), subsequent earnings growth is weak. If investors with limited attention focus on accounting profitability, and neglect information about cash profitability, then net operating assets, the cumulation of the discrepancies between the two, measures the extent to which reporting outcomes provoke over-optimism. During the 1964–2002 sample period, net operating assets scaled by total assets is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns.” They go on to state that, “The level of net operation assets . . . measures the extent to which operating/reporting outcomes provoke excessive investor optimism . . . In other words, a high level of net operating assets, scaled to control for firm size, indicates a lack of sustainability of recent earnings performance.” ([Location 4142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=4142))

On the other hand, companies with the highest relative change in total accruals to total assets are far more likely to experience negative earnings surprises in the future.

We follow a similar convention for each of the six factors. If a value is missing for a factor, we assign a neutral score of 50. Once all factors are ranked, we add the scores and assign them to deciles, with the 10 percent of stocks with the highest scores going into decile 1 and the ten percent of stocks with the lowest scores going into decile 10. Remember that decile 1 features the stocks with the lowest PEs, PSRs, and highest buyback yields, whereas ([Location 4667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=4667))

Yes, there will be times when you would have been better off focusing on a single factor, but the problem is that you don’t know when that time will be. For example, EBITDA/EV—the best single factor for the composited 1963–2009 period—beats Value Factor One in only 45 percent of all rolling one-year periods and in 46 percent of all rolling five-year periods. The only time it makes sense to favor a single factor over the composited value factors is when it is a key element of a multifactor ([Location 4702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=4702))

Since the ability to continually pay that high dividend is of the utmost importance to the strategy, we narrow the field of market-leading companies by eliminating the 50 percent with the worst EBITDA/EV. Since this factor looks at what the company is earning versus what it owes, this factor helps us determine how likely it is that the company will be able to continue to pay or increase its dividend.

- First, we look at buying the top decile of stocks with the best and the worst one-year earnings per share percentage changes from the All Stocks and Large Stocks universes. For this edition of the book, we have updated the formula within FactSet and are now able to look at stocks whose earnings went from positive to negative and vice versa. We accomplish this using the following formula to generate earnings changes: earnings per share (EPS) for current year minus ([Location 5034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5034))

Let’s look at the returns from buying the top decile (decile 1) of stocks from the All Stocks universe with the best one-year earnings-per-share percentage gains. As usual, we start with $10,000 and rebalance the composited portfolio annually. As Table 17.1 and 17.2 show, there’s very little difference in buying stocks with the biggest annual gain in earnings and buying a broad universe like All Stocks.

This is just slightly better return than a similar investment in All Stocks, where $10,000 grew to $1,329,513, an average annual compound return of 11.22 percent. The highest one-year earnings gainers from decile 1 were also riskier—their standard deviation was 22.10 percent compared to All Stocks’ 18.99 percent.

Indeed, the 1990s proved to be the best decade for six-month relative strength stocks between 1926 and 2009. We see later in the book that uniting relative strength with other factors works much better than using relative strength alone. But for now, it appears that six-month relative strength significantly outperforms All Stocks, adding 3.65 percent annualized to the performance of the All Stocks universe over the ([Location 5566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5566))

As Table 20.5 shows, $10,000 invested in the decile of stocks with the best 12-month price appreciation grew to $156,230,201, an average annual compound return of 12.34 percent ([Location 5577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5577))

The Sharpe ratio for the group of best-performing stocks based on 12-month price appreciation was .30 versus .25 for All Stocks.

- Price momentum conveys different information about the prospects of a stock and is a much better indicator than factors such as earnings growth rates. Many look at the disappointing results of buying stocks with the highest earnings gains and wonder why they differ from the best price performers.

When you look at the top performers over time, you find that they are rarely the highest valued in terms of PE or PSR. The same is true for five-year earnings per share growth rates and one-year earnings per share growth rates. As a group, they are usually higher than lower momentum stocks than the market, but not by extraordinary amounts. Also, Surowiecki’s concept of “wise crowds” is proven out in the longer-term data for price momentum, with ([Location 5646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5646))

- I want to point out a few additional factors that might be beneficial to consider in conjunction with price momentum. The first is the average daily volume of a stock over a six-month period. While we don’t have volume statistics available in the CRSP dataset, we do have them in the Compustat dataset beginning in 1964. Analyzing stocks by average six-month dollar volume, we find ([Location 5882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5882))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that the stocks with the greatest average six-month dollar trading volume have the lowest returns, while stocks with the lowest six-month trading volume have the highest returns. $10,000 invested on December 31, 1963, in the decile of stocks with the highest average dollar volume over the last six months becomes $357,900 by the end of 2009, an average annual compound return of 8.09 percent. That’s well below the 11.24 percent earned by the All Stocks universe over the same period, while the same $10,000 grows to $1.32 million. Conversely, an investment in the decile of stocks with the lowest six-month trading volume turned $10,000 into $2.9 million, an average annual compound return of 13.16 percent. The theory is that stocks with huge trading volumes are the subjects of greater speculation than those with lower trading volumes, and according to our results, the speculative names go on to do poorly in the future. Thus, linking pure price momentum to trading volume is a strategy worth considering. By adding points if the stock is in the seventh to tenth decile by average trading volume and subtracting points from the deciles with the highest trading ([Location 5885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=5885))

Also important to note is that the Market Leaders universe is equally weighted, whereas the S&P 500 is cap-weighted, giving far greater weight to the largest companies in the index. Currently, the Market Leaders universe ([Location 6166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=6166))

In contrast, the S&P 500 has a weighted market capitalization of $21.12 billion and a median market-cap of $9.35 billion, so Market Leaders focus on even larger stocks than those in the S&P 500. Over longer periods of time, equal-weighted indexes have outperformed cap-weighted indexes, another important fact when comparing the S&P 500 to Market Leaders.

Notice that the high valuations for the factors are not as devastating to Market Leaders as they are for All Stocks and Large Stocks, primarily because of the sheer size of the market leading companies. For example, the three worst-performing Market Leaders strategies are buying the stocks from Market Leaders with the worst scores on Value Composite Three, which returned 7.71 percent per year; buying the decile of Market Leaders with the lowest shareholder yield, which returned 7.25 percent per year and, in last place, buying the 10 percent of stocks from Market Leaders with the lowest buyback yield (essentially those Market Leaders that were net issuers of shares), which returned 6.76 percent.

Because the scope of this chapter is admittedly ambitious—and could easily be a book in its own right—out of necessity we will have to simplify the discussion in order to cover all 10 economic sectors concisely and within this single chapter. Here, rather than review factor performance by decile, as we have done so far with All Stocks and Large Stocks, we review and summarize the results from the All Stocks universe by quintile (20 percent increments). (We use quintiles here because several of the factors have too few constituents to make decile analysis feasible; by looking at 20 percent chunks of data, we are more able to draw reasonable conclusions about the efficacy of each factor by sector.) We also must begin our analysis on December 31, 1967, since prior to that there is no adequate data for all 10 sectors. For each of the 10 sectors, we provide:   • The compound average annual return (geometric mean) for the best and worst quintile • The standard deviation of return for the best quintile • The Sharpe ratio for the best quintile • The spread on the return of the best quintile minus the worst quintile • The spread of the return of the best quintile minus the sector benchmark • The worst drawdown for the best quintile • The beta of… ([Location 6423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=6423))

I think that the Trending Value portfolio is a strong attempt to do just that. Normally, a portfolio in which the final criterion is price momentum is considered a growth-oriented investment. Yet because we limit ourselves to the top decile of All Stocks by Value Factor Two, the pool of stocks we select from are pure value stocks. Indeed, when you run a correlation of the portfolio against the various Russell indexes, its highest correlation is with the Russell 2500 Value index. Yet, a recent run of the strategy reveals four stocks out of the top 50 with market-caps exceeding $10 billion, traditionally considered to be large-cap stocks. While the overall average market-cap of this recently run portfolio is $3.2 billion—squarely in mid-cap territory—you should think of this as a portfolio that can fish anywhere in the market capitalization range. Historically, it has always led to the mid-cap value category, but that doesn’t preclude it from being dominated by larger stocks sometime in the future.

- I promised in the Introduction to include several examples of the real, or inflation-adjusted, returns for a variety of indexes and strategies. While the nominal returns featured here give you a good sense of the comparative advantage or disadvantage of the strategies tested, they ignore the often pernicious and eroding effects of inflation. Most investors have a very difficult time trying to weigh the effects of inflation, and we rarely pay as much attention to it as we should.

- have performed until you take inflation into account. For example, when reviewing nominal returns, you might look at a portfolio that doubled from $10,000 to $20,000 over 10 years. On the face of it, you’d be tempted to congratulate yourself on that 100 percent gain. Yet you have no way of knowing whether you have doubled your purchasing power unless you look at inflation. Thus, if $10,000 bought you 100 units of your favorite goods and services 10 years ago but now those same 100 units cost you $20,000, your net increase in purchasing power over the 10 years is zero.

With this in mind, let’s look at some inflation-adjusted returns. Table 28.6 shows the real returns for an investment in a variety of instruments between 1927 and 2009.

- completely ignoring how the strategy has done over long periods of time. As investors, all of our information about returns is focused on extremely short periods of time. Just look at how much air time and column inches can be expended on why the stock market has gone up or down in a single day! However, over very short periods of time, the stock market is relatively impossible to forecast, yet when you extend your horizon, the market becomes far more… ([Location 7800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=7800))

The point is that at some time in the future any of the strategies in this book will underperform the market, and it is only those investors who can keep their focus on the very long term who will be able to stick with them and reap the rewards of a long-term commitment.

An investor who had loaded up on pricey dotcom and tech stocks over the previous five years looks like a genius, and was no doubt planning for an early retirement. Conversely, an investor who had played it safe during those same five years and stuck to small-cap stocks and large-cap value fare would have been wincing with disappointment about his portfolio’s… ([Location 7813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NASI8S&location=7813))

- and the small-cap and large-cap value portfolio began to soar. By focusing on how your portfolio is performing against a benchmark over rolling periods, you will get a much better sense of how you are actually doing. You will be much more likely to stick with a strategy that may be underperforming recently but has an outstanding win rate versus the market over all rolling periods. It gives you continuous feedback that allows you to take the hills and valleys with greater restraint than if you simply looked at a snapshot of time.

Finally, this advice is equally useful after sharp drawdowns for stocks.
