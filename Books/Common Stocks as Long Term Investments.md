- Is it not possible that the definite weakness of otherwise perfectly safe bonds is overlooked—namely, that they cannot in any way participate in the growth and increasing activity of the country—that they are defenceless against a depreciating currency?

- Such fluctuations as do occur in the dollar price of bonds result from— 1. Changes in the credit position of the issuing company—the prospects of its being able to pay interest and principal when due. This is largely influenced by its earning power in excess of current interest requirements. 2. Changes in the current demand and supply of liquid capital, in relation to the length of the unexpired term and the fixed interest rate of the bonds in question.{1} ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=178))

- All debtors favor a depreciating dollar. An increasing value to the dollar is accompanied by distress on the part of large portions of the community, a lessening of its value is accompanied by an appearance of great prosperity and a general feeling of well-being.

- The Dollar to-day is a different measure from the Dollar of yesterday. The Mark of to-day—well, let us say of an hour ago—is a different measure of value from the Mark of the moment. And so it is with the Pound Sterling, the Franc, the Ruble, the Yen, and to add to the confusion, the only simple way we can describe the varying value of one fluctuating measure of value is in terms of other fluctuating measures of value. Logically this cannot be done. But it is done. It is done solely because something has to be done, and no more satisfactory method has been devised for defining value. The best that can be said is that some measures of value are more stable than others. During one period of years it may be the Pound Sterling with which all other measures are compared; during another it may be the Dollar. But over any considerable period of time, it can be safely stated, the actual measure of true wealth or true value will change. It has never remained the same and the chances are that unless some entirely new method is found for measuring value, it never will remain the same.

- Take an insurance company for example. It is by the nature of its business perfectly safeguarded against any possible loss through the depreciation of the dollar. It deals in nothing but dollars. Its contracts call for the payment of future dollars. It therefore requires to know only that it will receive from its investments more future dollars than it will have to pay out. The purchasing power of those future dollars is of no concern to it. If dollars have shrunk in value, the beneficiary under its policies absorbs the shrinkage, the company does not.

- Theoretically, if the dollar depreciates in value during the period of investment, his stock will rise in dollar value to a corresponding degree, and his income will increase correspondingly, and, theoretically, if the dollar appreciates in value ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=303))

- Well—let us see how it would work out if our fathers had invested solely in common stocks, not with the thought of immediate speculative gain, a thought that it is unfortunately most difficult to eliminate from the choice of common stocks, but with the sober-minded purpose of providing 1. Constancy of Income, 2. Safety of Principal. Constancy or regularity of income is placed first because it is the factor that is ordinarily considered to be ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=318))

- Each test assumes the investment of approximately $10,000 in ten diversified common stocks of large companies and an investment of an equal amount in high grade bonds. They cover the entire period from 1866 to date, and the supposed purchase of stocks is made without reference to the condition of the stock market at the time of purchase except in those tests where a peak in the market has been deliberately chosen ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=345))

- These tests we have made are not in themselves conclusive, but cumulatively they tend to show that well diversified lists of common stocks selected on simple and broad principles of diversification respond to some underlying factor which gives them a margin of advantage over high grade bonds for long term investment. But in view of the speculative attributes known to exist in common stocks we are hardly justified in accepting stocks as an alternative to high grade bonds for long term investment unless we are able to isolate this underlying factor with a view to appraising its potency under varying conditions and the likelihood of its continued operation in the future. It seems desirable, therefore, to make further studies of the data assembled in order to develop from them a picture of the results which would follow the holding of common stocks from the earliest date down to the present day.

- We have found that there is a force at work in our common stock holdings which tends ever toward in-creasing their principal value in terms of dollars, a force resulting from the profitable reinvestment, by the companies involved, of their undistributed earnings. We have found that unless we have had the extreme misfortune to invest at the very peak of a noteworthy rise, those periods in which the average market value of our holdings remains less than the amount we paid for them are of comparatively short duration, and that even if we have bought at the very peak, there is definitely to be expected a period in which we may recover as many dollars as we have invested. Our hazard even in such extreme cases appears to be that of time alone. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=997))

- These figures, which imply the total absence of any judgment in the selection of the time when purchases are made, suggest that in buying a well-diversified group of representative common stocks in essential industries, our chances of coming out even, or of making a profit in principal values, are: Within 1 year, 78 in 100; 2 years, 87 in 100; 4 years, 94 in 100.

- The economists would say that it is the upward “Secular Trend” that favors common stocks as opposed to bonds, so long as the population and the business of the country are increasing. There is something more than growth of population that contributes to the rise in the “Secular Trend” and the increase in business from decade to decade. It is the constantly accelerating speed of modern life. All our activities are on a much more rapid basis to-day than they were twenty years ago, due in part to the constant increase in the speed of communication and transportation and the countless major and minor time-saving devices that have been introduced into our business and private life. All these have increased the annual turnover per capita, increasing the rapidity of the circulation of money which is another form of depreciating what might be termed the social value of currency as opposed to its commodity purchasing value. All this acceleration favors carefully selected and diversified common stocks as opposed to bonds. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1037))

- There is another factor which favors a diversified list of common stocks in sound companies of good credit as opposed to bonds. It might be termed the “Human Factor” in the management of the companies involved. The management of every company is on the side of the common stock and opposed to the interests of the bondholders. The management does not want the bondholders to get more benefit from the operation of the company than is absolutely necessary to make it possible for the company to sell more bonds if such additional sale of bonds can be made to show a profit to the stockholders.

- We have before us to-day a case where the depreciation of currency has been carried by a highly organized commercial and industrial country, beyond the limit of anything previously imaginable. GERMANY What the final outcome will be in Germany cannot be foreseen, but we do know that the demoralization of currency values has completely wiped out the creditor class. The holders of bonds who depended entirely or in large part upon the interest that they received, became paupers. And the industrial leaders who, through the ownership of large blocks of common stock which control the processes of industry, and who were shrewd enough to use the depreciating Mark as a method of increasing their common stock control, are to-day the most powerful men in Germany. What the future holds for them at the hands of political powers outside of Germany cannot be foreseen, but to date, they have prospered inordinately. Our own currency has depreciated very greatly in the last twenty years and our own holders of common stocks have profited in proportion, at the expense of our investors in bonds. We cannot foretell whether the dollar will appreciate rapidly during the next twenty years as it did in the period from 1866 to 1885, but our enormous gold reserves of to-day as opposed to our inadequate gold reserves of 1866 may lead me to question whether such a rapid appreciation is likely to occur.

- All lenders of money, particularly bondholders, favor an appreciating currency. No other class is always actively in favor of an appreciating currency. In theory they all believe in sound or stable currency, but each, in his effort to widen the margin of profit that he makes in relation to profits in other lines, at times subscribes to activities which tend toward depreciation. Fortunately business men are both buyers and sellers. In buying they work for appreciating dollars, in selling they endeavor to depreciate the currency. Thus, with the bankers, who are both lenders and borrowers, their activities tend to effect a balance between the lenders on the one hand and labor, which always works for depreciation, on the other. If our tests have been of any significance, they have shown that even in periods of appreciating currency such as the periods from 1865 to 1885 and 1880 to 1900, well diversified lists of common stocks in the largest and most important industries of the country have shown, on the whole, favorable results in comparison with bonds during the same periods. In periods where the dollar was depreciating, they have shown results so far superior to those obtained from high grade bonds, that there is really no comparison to be made between them. There would, therefore, seem to be ample justification for including as a part of the investment of any large private fortune a relatively large proportion of sound, well diversified common stocks, selected not for their immediate market possibilities, but rather with their long term investment prospects in mind.

- In the various tests we have made of the relative long term investment values of common stocks and bonds we purposely avoided any emphasis upon the weaker aspects of an investment confined to bonds, in order that the results of our tests might not be subject to question. It is now desirable to draw another picture showing the real hazards in an investment confined to maturing obligations. It is generally recognized that common stocks are subject to changes in market value, which may be at times rapid. But it is not so generally recognized that bonds and mortgages are subject to changes in real value almost as drastic as stocks, rarely as rapid, but perhaps more insidious in that they are not so easily appraised. The words “bond” and “mortgage” have for so long connoted security and safety, while the word “stock” has been so widely accepted as synonymous with risk and hazard, that an investor feels he is necessarily acting with more prudence and conservatism when he buys bonds and mortgages than when he buys stocks. Yet frequently this is not the case. Let us, then, examine the underlying forces which affect the investment value of long term bonds. If we do this in connection with our studies of common stocks, we can hardly fail to see that we have still further grounds for the belief that, under proper diversification, common stocks deserve to have a far better long term investment rating than is usually accorded them.

- A purchaser in April, 1902, of Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe General 4% bonds, due 1995, or of New York Central & Hudson River Railroad 3½% bonds, due 1997, would have fared as follows if he had been forced to sell these bonds in July, 1920:   But the dollar in 1920 had only 37% of the purchasing power of the dollar of 1902, so that the real value remaining to the investor of what he actually invested in 1902 was as follows:   In other words, he would have lost over 74% of the principal value of his investment in Atchison bonds; and over 78% of his investment in New York Central bonds, and none of this loss would have been due to any impairment in the credit position of these companies. These illustrations, while extreme, focus attention on two elements of risk that exist even in the highest grade of bonds in addition to the element which is given most prominence by a majority of those who offer bonds for sale: (1) Depreciation of the Dollar. (2) A General Increase in Current Interest Rates. The third element which exists in some degree in all bonds and is most frequently discussed is: (3) The Changing Credit Position of the Debtor Company. The credit position of a company is subject to change over a period of years, either through changes in management or policies, or through changes in the underlying price, wage, social, or industrial factors upon which prosperity of the company depends. In the case of the two bonds cited, we have instances of heavy loss in principal value sustained by the holder of bonds of the highest character, due to an increase in the general interest rate and a coincident lowering of the purchasing power of the dollar. There was no weakening of the credit position of the issuing companies. These bonds have since recovered a part of their price loss due to a falling in the general interest rate since 1920, and have further regained… ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1132))

- So far our investor would feel that his foresight in 1902, if it could be called such, had been rewarded by a handsome increase in the capital value of his investment. But if he then made inquiry as to what he could buy with the proceeds of the sale of his bond as compared with what the smaller number of dollars which he invested in 1902 would have bought at the time he invested them, he might not be quite so well pleased. The dollar in 1920 had only 37% of the purchasing power of the 1902 dollar: ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1185))

- Going back to our original tests of the relative long term investment value of twelve separate groups of stocks and of high grade bonds, we discover that the favorable showing of common stocks in the comparison has been made even though one important item has been left out of the picture. We now want to bring this item into clear relief, as it is of the greatest importance to those who may be led by these studies to substitute a fair proportion of common stocks for bonds which they have been holding. It is an essential element in the sound investment management of a fund invested in common stocks. Our lists of common stocks have, in every test, shown a higher total income than bonds for the same period. But in considering this surplus income, we have so far given no weight to the fact that it becomes available in small amounts annually and not in one lump sum, as we have shown it in the totals. Technically and actually, this has a most important bearing upon the relative merits of stocks and bonds as a medium of long term investment. If we are to compare the results of long term investment in stocks as against bonds, it is not fair to stocks to assume that the excess income that they yield from year to year is immediately dissipated. This excess income over bonds, at a given time represents, in theory, the annual value of the additional risk involved in the purchase of a single stock as compared with the purchase of a single bond. We have seen that by diversifying our list of stocks, we have, in practice, eliminated this risk, while the public, by ignoring the fluctuating purchasing power of the dollar, has underestimated the risk attached to holding bonds.

- Let us, then, treat this annual excess income from stocks as a genuine reserve against the supposed risk of holding common stocks. Let us grant our investor the right to spend only the amount he would have received from an investment in bonds. Let us cause him to reinvest the annual surplus income from stocks each year as he receives it. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1273))

- For convenience we will assume that such reinvestment takes the form of additional purchases of the stocks appearing in his original list. The following supplementary tests show how such a policy carried out in connection with our original Tests Nos. 3, 4 and 5 would have affected the results of these tests. For ease of identification we give the supplementary tests the same numbers as the original tests to which they apply. The stocks purchased in each succeeding year are taken in rough rotation from the ten stocks of the original tests. Deviations from strict rotation are necessary in order to employ as large a part as possible of the fund available at the end of the year, on the basis of stock quotations in January of the following year. Some stocks sell so high that not even one share can be bought, others at figures that leave too large an idle balance. In one case quotations were not available. Aside from these considerations the rotation of stocks is maintained. We assume further that all dividends received from new stocks purchased are added to the amount available for investment in the following January. The value of these supplementary tests is not merely theoretical. They point to an essential part of any investment policy which contemplates the purchase of common stocks. For while it is true that the income from the stocks in our various tests has rarely fallen, in a single year, below the income that could have been received from high grade bonds, yet above this point the… ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1276))

- We may, then, summarize the principal functions of Investment Management as follows: 1. It will first establish a sound investment plan suitable to the purposes of the investor. 2. It will then determine what proportion of the fund under its management shall be in equities and what proportion in bonds under current industrial and economic conditions. 3. It will put itself in a position to watch for changes in conditions and be prepared to modify these proportions in harmony with such changes.

- 4. It will study the current conditions of various industries and groups of industries, and will select as its field a diversification of those which upon reliable data may be regarded as the more promising. 5. It will then examine the management and financial structure of the leading companies in these industries. 6. It will watch for changes both in the conditions of industries and of individual corporations and be prepared to change the investment to accord with sound analysis of the latest available information. 7. It will retain diversification as its fundamental principle, but will establish reasonable limitations to diversification in order not to dilute the quality of management applied.

- This is no simple task. It is a task which each individual investor, responsible not only for his own welfare but for the welfare of those he is to leave behind him, must appraise in relation both to his own experience and training in a highly technical field and in relation to the amount of time and the facilities at his disposal to properly undertake it. The writer believes that it is a task that can be properly undertaken only by an organization in which men of varied experience and training in the financial field unite with the single purpose of applying their best combined judgment continuously, with the least managerial complications, to the supervision of a single investment fund in which a large number of individual investors may participate. Thus, alone, may the best results be obtained. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XG4MQ55&location=1421))
