## Highlights
- We arrived in Beaulieu-sur-Mer late in the afternoon-happily, in time for the dinner hour. The flight had exhausted us so we decided to rest before our much anticipated culinary adventure. Just as we stretched out on the bed and began to enjoy the balmy October afternoon, the telephone rang. The hotel operator informed me that my assistant, Samantha, was calling from New York.When I picked up the receiver, Sam, as I called her, told me she had received a call from an FBI agent. She gave me his number. He had told her to have me call him as soon as possible; she did not know why he was calling. It sounded urgent, so I said I would call him the minute we hung up. Before I got off the line, however, I asked to speak to one of my senior partners, John Levin. His first words to me, ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=41))

- without even a hello, were: "Congratulations! The bonds have made a huge move. We're up 60 percent for the year." And the fiscal year had just started!I knew the bond market had turned, but the magnitude of the move and its impact on our portfolio stunned me. Sitting on the side of the bed, I felt tremendous satisfaction in having been right, and having done so in an investment arena that was entirely new to me-the bond market. Since the age of 13, stocks had held a magical fascination for me. From amateur investor to professional, from analyst to trader to chief portfolio manager, my expertise had been in the stock market and my career had focused exclusively on stocks. The investment climate of the early 1980s, however, had created an extraordinary opportunity-better than any alternative, including stocks-in the bond market.At the start of the 1980s, spiraling inflation, and the need to control it, plagued the U.S. economy. The federal government was running a huge deficit-enough to consume 2.5 percent of the nation's economic output. Long-term Treasury rates rose from about 10 percent in 1980 to almost 16 percent by September 1981. Short-term interest rates rose to 17 percent. Using "monetary policy"-mostly interest rate pressure-the ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=46))

- chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, attempted to curb inflation but had had little success to date.During the same period, Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers (a man affectionately referred to as "Dr. Doom"), accentuated fixed-income fears with his direpredictions of record-high interest rates and runaway inflation. Most other economists on Wall Street were equally bearish on bonds-they referred to them as "certificates of confiscation"-and felt that inflation would continue to increase on both cyclical and secular bases. Oil prices were high and were predicted to continue rising.I viewed things differently.So, in the late spring, in the face of rapidly rising interest rates, I had begun a foray into the bond market. I started buying bonds on the premise that the economy would weaken faster than expected and would eventually cause a healthy drop in interest rates. Not only did I buy them; I bought them using leverage, or borrowed funds,… ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=53))

- securities. Typically, one could get 95 to 99 percent of a bond's value. I saw an opportunity to earn compelling returns by borrowing most of the money to do so, albeit with a degree of leverage I had not used before.In the early 1980s, I managed about $75 million in my two hedge funds-the flagship Steinhardt Partners, LP, and an offshore fund, SP International. Following my instincts, we invested $50 million of the funds' cash and borrowed another $200 million to buy a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of intermediate 10-year Treasury bonds. For a neophyte bond investor-indeed… ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=60))

- The most valuable class I took at Penn, the one that had the most influence on my thinking, was an advanced course called Philosophy of Statistics, taught by Dr. Francis Brown. I had always been comfortable with numbers and statistics, but this course offered a framework for understanding probabilities better, in both familiar and remote applications. In class, we learned how to frame problems quantitatively so as to arrive at unexpected probability distributions, and how to develop some formulas where none seemed possible. This study of statistics, combined with my major in sociology, was a superb combination for a career in the stock market. Mastering statistics helped me apply ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=543))

- probability theory with great comfort, and the sociology exposed me to ways of thinking about human behavior with a mathematical overview.With this background, I could interpret a range of quantitative issues with sufficient numeric impact to gain a confidence not easily achieved otherwise. Even limited quantification made me comfortable with analyzing areas about which, at best, I had partial knowledge. Thus years later, this made me better equipped to deal with decision making on a multitude of issues with incomplete data that define the reality of the investment process involved. Probability analysis of some sort is a part of every investment calculation. I learned this discipline early and, over time, would apply it well.

- We were not the first to create the hedge fund structure, although we certainly were early pioneers. A. W. Jones, a sociologist, started the first hedge fund in 1949. He combined the purchase of cheap stocks with the short selling of overpriced stocks and added leverage, and created a successful strategy that was intended to make money regardless of the overall direction of the market. The fund was considered "hedged" and the term "hedge fund" was launched. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=841))

- I liked to say that, contrary to conventional wisdom, we created a conservative medium that used speculative techniques to ameliorate risk. Most traditional money managers at that time were nearly entirely invested on the long side and therefore had anywhere between 85 and 99 percent of their capital exposed to the stock market all the time. This works well when the market goes up, but when the market goes down, such investment vehicles invariably lose money. Our hedge fund sought to generate absolute positive returns for our investors, regardless of the direction of the stock market.We also felt it was critical for each of us to invest ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=847))

Indeed, throughout my career, the great bulk of my personal net worth was always invested in my funds, and, to this day, I will not invest money with a manager who does not do the same.

- In the Go-Go years, stocks were purchased in a fast, lively, almost peremptory manner, sometimes with scant information. All that was needed was a "story" that preferably could be told in a nutshell and tagged with a name that captured it succinctly. At Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz & Company (or SFB, as we came to be known), we were aggressive early buyers of story stocks. We listened and quickly we got it.

- To this day, I will often ask a money manager what his or her biggest mistake has been so far. I have found that the best traders seem to remember their failures better than their successes, as do I. One of my earliest and perhaps most horrific experiences occurred when I shorted Occidental Petroleum (OXY).The company was run by Armand Hammer, a too-clever man of myriad international conspiracies, and ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=918))

- a superb promoter whose statements were often far too optimistic. I knew the company well, had traded in it successfully several times, and had decided, for reasons such as my bias against CEOs like Hammer, that the stock had become overvalued. I started shorting it in the mid-20s and continued, painfully, averaging up into the 30s. But the worst was yet to come. Before I couldgrasp what was happening, the stock spiked. Rumors abounded of a major discovery in Libya with speculation that the reserves discovered would rival Saudi Arabia. In a matter of a few days, the stock more than doubled. I was beside myself. The position represented only a small portion of our portfolio; nonetheless, it was excruciating to find myself so dead wrong about a stock that I thought I knew so well. The loss seemed enormous, and I was deeply upset. Whenever you lose on the short side, it is that much more frightening because the loss is theoretically without limit.Each tick of the action in OXY preoccupied my every thought and dwarfed all other positions in the portfolio at the time. Moreover, I could not make a clear judgment as to whether this supposed discovery was any more substantial than others the company had been rumored to have made in the past-discoveries that never panned out. Alas, promoters sometimes get ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=921))

- lucky too. I was a young money manager who had just lost a vast amount of money, and with that came a comparable loss of conviction. Estimates of a multibillion-barrel find abounded. I was in no position. to dispute this.I was sitting at my desk at 67 Beaver Street after the market closed one day. Feeling morose and utterly defeated, I stared out the window. I was paralyzed. Howard came in, and, while he too was pretty down in spirits, he did not feel quite as bad as I did. This was my position and my responsibility. He tried to be consoling, but I would not respond.As the sun set, I continued staring out the window. Soon my friend from Goldman Sachs, Eric Sheinberg, with whom I was having dinner that night, came in, saw my mood, and, in a singularly annoying way, tried to be upbeat. He said silly things, like, "Relax, Mike, you still have your fingers and your toes."When he said that particular line, I looked at him and said, "Well, how about testing yours?"I glanced sneakily at Howard.… ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=928))

- We rarely played the Nifty Fifty stocks from the long side. We had an aversion to paying high multiples even when we were sufficiently persuaded of the growth prospects. It seemed to us that unless one could realistically seek the expansion of a multiple as well as earnings growth in a long investment, it wasn't worth ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1148))

- doing. Further, we never had the "religion" of the institutional-fund stars who made these one-decision stocks. These managers truly believed that investors could own the top growth stocks forever. We knew no investment was sacred and this led to a perpetual skepticism, perhaps even an indiscriminate skepticism toward companies about which others waxed euphoric. Indeed I have never thought that any stock or style of investing is of the one-decision type, especially not when valuations become extraordinary, as they did during this period. If the Nifty Fifty fad was ever going to end, it was inevitably going to end badly. We wanted to make sure that we would profit, not suffer, from it.I remember when the Dow first closed above 1000 in the fall of 1972. The Nifty Fifty were the leaders. We were net long about 50 percent: we were positive on the market but were deploying our capital somewhat conservatively. By the time the averages peaked a few months later, we had sold out most of our longs and again gone net short.One of the rules of shorting stocks is that you have to sell on an "uptick." The rule was imposed to help achieve stability in periods of sharp market declines. This necessitates establishing a short position ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1150))

- while there are still plenty of buyers in the market. Therefore, to establish a short, you sometimes have to be a little bit early. Being early means you often have pain before you make money. For one fiscal year (1972), we underperformed.This period created considerable tension within the firm. We were short the "best" companies in America-a frightening prospect. Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, McDonald's-we were short them all. These companies were growing, were competitively advantaged, and had outstanding management and high visibility-perhaps everything one would want in a long investment. We had just one overriding basis for being short: price. I must acknowledge that classic short selling would not favor price as the determining factor. Textbook short selling would necessitate finding securities with deteriorating fundamentals, weak competitive positions, vulnerable dividends, and leveraged balance sheets… ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1157))

- Beingshort the Nifty Fifty was the truly contrarian view, and when views are truly contrarian, they are inevitably uncomfortable. Courage and the ability to withstand pain are required.By the time the Nifty Fifty finally started to break in 1973, it was often too late to get an "uptick." The bear market that started then was not a panic, as in 1929, but it certainly was tedious and relentless. Day after day, month after month, the market kept going down. Brokers would call us because they were trading a block of stock. They knew we were short that stock and wanted us to buy back or "cover" on their trade. We passed and stayed short, often waiting patiently to cover much later when the… ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1166))

- money when everyone else was losing. People questioned whether short selling was un-American and innately manipulative. Management whined about how short sellers were beating up their stocks.In 1973, the Dow was flat and we were up about 15 percent. By fiscal 1974, when the market was down 38 percent, we were up 34 percent. Most of the former "hot" institutional portfolio managers at the major banks lost about 50 percent when the Nifty Fifty tanked, but even they fared better than many of the "star" mutual fund managers, some of whom lost a startling 80 to 90 percent. People began referring to us as greedy and arrogant. Nothing gives a better feeling to a money manager than making money for his or her investors when almost everyone else is losing. That was, for me, the height of professional satisfaction.In an absolute sense, there are two reasons why profit in a down period, from short selling, can never match the magnitude of a comparable success on the long side.For one thing,… ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1172))

- treated for tax purposes as short-term transactions.Still, nothing feels better than the psychic joy of having protected one's capital while disasters abound.By the time the Dow hit bottom (577, in December 1974), it had lost almost 50 percent of its value from its high of over 1000 in January 1973. Yet, even the Dow averages did not reflect the carnage that was taking place within the overall market. By then, bearishness was rampant and people were afraid to own stocks. However, because we had been so successful during this debacle, we had great confidence in our view that the market was sufficiently pessimistic to create a bottom. Just as outright euphoria is often a sign of a market top, fear is, for sure, a sign of a market bottom. Time and time again, in every market… ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1179))

- In the course of one month, we switched our net exposure from minus 55 percent to plus 35 percent-a huge reversal from short to long. We would have gotten much more aggressively long had we been able to find fundamentally attractive choices fast enough. Somewhat randomly, we bought a broad basket of single-digit stocks (stocks that were trading under $10 a share) with institutional names that had been decimated in this bear-market period. Market timing dominated, and we did not haveenough time to do serious research or to easily make the necessary mental switch. We just knew we wanted to put money to work in the market quickly. Thus, we were a little indiscriminate regarding the names we bought, but many of our purchases were trading at 75 to 80 percent of book value with price-earnings multiples of around seven… ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1187))

- the virtue of using variant perception as an analytic tool. I defined variant perception as holding a well-founded view that was meaningfully different from market consensus. I often said that the only analytic tool that mattered was an intellectually advantaged disparate view. This included knowing more and perceiving the situation better than others did. It was also critical to have a keen understanding of what the market expectations truly were. Thus, the process by which a disparate perception, when correct, became consensus would almost inevitably lead to meaningful profit. Understanding market expectation was at least as important as, and often different from, fundamental knowledge. As a firm, we soon found that we excelled at this. We took exactly that approach during the early 1970s, when most of our success resulted from our implementation of perceptions that were meaningfully at variance with consensus wisdom. We shorted near the top, in the face of great bullishness, and we got long at the bottom, in the face of keen pessimism… ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1193))

At the end of our fiscal year on September 30, 1979, I was going to walk out the door of Steinhardt, Berkowitz, & Company and not come back.Filled with anxiety and, at the same time, flush with excitement about what I was about to do, I went to my partner, Howard Berkowitz, and told him of my decision. We had a long philosophical discussion about both his and my future. Several days later, Howard met with me to suggest that it would be in everybody's ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000VU5F9U&location=1274))
