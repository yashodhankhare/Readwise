## Highlights
- We want high returns from our investments, but we want much more. We want to nurture hope for riches and ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=115))

- banish fear of poverty. We want to be number 1 and beat the market. We want to feel pride when our investments bring gains and avoid the regret that comes with losses. We want the status and esteem of hedge funds, the warm glow and virtue of socially responsible funds, and the patriotism of investing in our own country. We want good advice from financial advisors, magazines, and the Internet. We want to be free from government regulations yet be protected by regulators. We want financial markets to be fair but search for an edge that would let us win, sometimes fair and at other times not. We want to leave a legacy for our children when we are gone. And we want to leave nothing for the tax man. The sum of our wants and behaviors makes financial markets go up or down as we herd together or go our separate ways, sometimes inflating bubbles and at other times popping them.

- Investments are like jobs, and their benefits extend beyond money. Investments express parts of our identity, whether that of a trader, a gold accumulator, or a fan of hedge funds. Investments are a game to many of us, like tennis. We may not admit it, and we may not even know it, but our actions show that we are willing to pay money for the investment game. This is money we pay in trading commissions, mutual fund fees, and software that promises to tell us where the stock market is headed.

- Movies touch our emotions and add to our well-being. They make us laugh and cry and help us enjoy the company of dates, spouses, children, and friends. Indeed, we enjoy movies more when we share expressions and emotions with our companions.4 The world of investments is different from the world of the movies because it offers no clear boundary between fact and fiction.

- We are often advised to use reason, not emotions, when we make investment decisions. But this advice is neither feasible nor smart. Emotions complement reason more often than they interfere with it, and the interaction between emotions and reason is mostly beneficial, often critically so. Emotions prevent us from being lost in thought when it is time to act, and emotions reinforce lessons we must learn. Regret is a painful emotion but it is also an effective teacher. Regret over unwise choices teaches us to make better ones. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=187))

- Other cognitive errors include hindsight, which misleads us into thinking that we could have seen winning investments with foresight when in truth we have seen them only with hindsight; overconfidence, which leads us to overestimate our investment skills; and availability, which leads us to exaggerate the likelihood that we will pick top-performing mutual funds because mutual ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=211))

- Investment advice is full of shoulds: save more, spend less, diversify, buy-and-hold. Wants are visceral while shoulds are reasoned. Wants emphasize the expressive and emotional benefits of investments while shoulds emphasize the utilitarian ones. Wants often drive us into stupid investment choices, while shoulds drive us mostly into smart ones. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=230))

- We are similar to one another in our wants, thoughts, cognitive errors, and emotions, but we are not identical. Some of us are more likely than others to be fooled by hindsight, some are more fearful, and some find special joy in trading. Our wants, thoughts, cognitive errors, and emotions affect our own behavior. But what is the sum of our behaviors?

- for gain, gullibility are the real bases of this trading. The sober common-sense of the intelligent business man has no part in such investment.”11 The World’s Work punctuated its warning with a story about a man, the son of a country doctor, who reached adulthood and was about to go into business. His father took him into the little back office, swung open the door of the rusty old safe, and took out a thick bundle of stock certificates. “My son,” he said, “you are going into business, and, I hope, will make some money. . . . When the time comes you will wish to buy some mining stock. Everyone does. When that time arrives come to see me. I will sell you some of mine. They are just as good, and will keep the money in the family.’”12 ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=330))

- We cannot be competent surgeons with little knowledge of the human body, we cannot be competent lawyers with little knowledge of the law, and we cannot be competent teachers with little knowledge of the subject matter we teach. Yet we can be competent investors with virtually no knowledge of the companies whose stocks we buy. S&P 500 Index mutual funds contain 500 stocks, and more comprehensive index funds contain thousands of stocks. Rare are the index fund investors who can name more than a few dozen of these stocks. Rarer still are index fund investors who know something about these companies beyond their names. Surgeons, lawyers, and teachers with no knowledge of their fields cannot hope to earn average incomes. Yet investors with no knowledge of stocks earn average returns by nothing more than investing in index funds. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=558))

- The “law of large numbers” is an important law of science. It teaches us, for instance, that that the percentage of heads in a sequence of coin tosses is likely to be closer to 50 percent when we toss a coin a large number of times, say 600, than when we toss it a small number of times, say six. Rational investors know the law of large numbers, even if they have never attended a statistics course. But we, normal investors, use intuition in place of formal statistics. We believe that a random sequence, such as a coin toss, will generate close to 50 percent heads not only when we toss the coin a large number of times but also when we toss it a small number of times.

- Availability errors induce mutual fund managers to play the equivalent of a tennis tournament where only the top-ranked players appear on the list, making them available to our minds. Middle-ranked mutual funds are like middle-ranked tennis players and bottom-ranked mutual funds are like bottom-ranked tennis players: they get no notice. Imagine you have been playing in a tennis tournament, and now, midway through the tournament, you are in the middle of the pack. You have played conservatively until now and you are likely to end up without a prize if you continue to play that way.

- it make sense to take some risks and adopt some aggressive moves? After all, what is there for you to lose? If the moves don’t work, you’ll end up at the bottom, as prizeless as the players in the middle. But if the moves work, you might win a major prize as one of the top players. Tennis players who lag behind take risks in their quest for prizes, and so do fund managers. Fund managers, who find themselves in the middle of the pack by mid-year, gamble by increasing the risk of their funds in the second half of the year.35 If the gamble works, they are rewarded by bonuses and investors’ money flowing into their funds. If the gamble does not work, their funds trail the average fund by an even greater amount than they would have trailed without the added risk. This gamble is evidently worthwhile in the eyes of fund managers. But what about the investors, asks the naïve observer; aren’t they better off when their fund is in the middle of the pack than at the bottom? Aren’t investors the losers in the gamble? Well, the gamble works for fund managers, the gamble works for fund companies, and, as the saying goes, two out of three ain’t bad.

- Reason instructs us to expect high returns only when we take high risks and warns us against investments promising returns higher than risks. But sentiment instructs us otherwise. We expect our investments to bring returns higher than risks when our sentiment is positive, as when we are in love, even when the object of love is nothing more than an investment. But when sentiment ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=899))

- The number 18 is lucky by Jewish tradition because its digits correspond to the word “live.” People often give gifts of money to family, friends, and charity in multiples of 18.

- times the average annual income of people in China for license plate APY888. The numbers 7 and 5 are neutral, but the number 4 is unlucky. Taiwanese consumers were more willing to buy portable radios priced at the lucky but expensive TW$888 than at the neutral but inexpensive TW$777. They were also more willing to pay TW$6,555.55 for a digital camera than TW$6,444,44.7 Investments acquire positive or negative sentiment in the minds of investors as radios and cameras do. Stocks offered for sale in initial public offerings by Chinese companies are six times more likely to be assigned prices that end with the lucky number 8, conveying positive sentiment, than with the unlucky number 4, burdened by negative sentiment.8 The letter A evokes more positive sentiment than the letter B. We prefer an A on our exam to a B, and we would rather have an A rating on our bond than a B. Not all investors know that bonds rated A are actually third-rate bonds, lagging behind AAA and AA bonds, and few investors know that Class A shares are inferior to Class B shares. Class B shares are superior because they have all the benefits of Class A shares in addition to greater voting rights. Each Class A share has one vote, whereas each Class B share has five or ten votes. Yet investors are willing to pay more for Class A shares than for Class B shares although the returns of Class A shares are lower than the returns of Class B shares.9 ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=926))

- late 1990s commercial by an online broker showed a crowd of people rushing toward the trading floor of a stock exchange where they are blocked by heavy doors and a glass wall. The traders on the ornate trading floor are all men in dark suits, content insiders in the investment establishment, while the people in crowd pressing to get in are the angry outsiders. “Until now, there has been a wall between you and serious trading,” says the narrator, “That wall is coming down.” We see the bursting doors and shattered glass wall as the crowd rushes in, and the horrified looks on the faces of the establishment traders, cowering in a rain of glass shards. Anger against the investment and business establishment was on display more recently. A day-trading company offered seminars in 2010 at a $3,995 fee, tapping into the anger of investors. “People put their trust in stockbrokerages that are now out of business, and have seen their 401(k) drop by 40 percent or more,” said Michael Hutchison of that day-trading company. “I get e-mails from people saying, ‘I worked for XYZ company for 20 years and I just got laid off,’” said Brian Shannon of another day-trading company. “They’ve got a severance package or a nest egg that they want to invest themselves.”42 ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1162))

Undeterred by fear, brain-damaged players played more rounds of the game than normal players and won more money.45 Still, dampened fear places brain-damaged people at a disadvantage when reason calls for sitting out rather than playing. Many people with ventromedial prefrontal brain damage went bankrupt because fear did not deter them from reckless investments with catastrophic losses.

- JH.B. is the anonymous author of a 1930 book, Watch Your Margin: An Insider Looks at Wall Street. He is also “one of the most successful stock operators of the last twenty years.” W. E. Woodward, J.H.B.’s friend, wrote the introduction to the book. “When a man writes an introduction to an anonymous book,” wrote Woodward, “the idea pops into everybody’s head that the rascal wrote the book himself and, for some reason or other, wants to deny his authorship.”1 Woodward assures us that our suspicions are unfounded. “Like everybody else, I am enormously fascinated by the art of money making,” he wrote, “but I am quite incapable of making money myself, in any impressive quantity, and I haven’t the faintest notion of how one goes about writing a book about stock speculation.”2 “Do you know why people go into stock speculation?” asked J.H.B. “To make money,” answered Woodward. “Not at all,” said J.H.B., “They go in for the pleasure of getting something for nothing. . . . What they want is a thrill. That is why we . . . drink bootleg whisky, and kiss the girls, and take new jobs. We want thrills. It’s perfectly human, but Wall Street is a poor place to look for thrills, for the simple reason that thrills in Wall Street are very expensive.”3 ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1210))

Jeff Yass, a co-founder, said, “At Susquehanna, where the average guy is probably 25 or 26 years old, they all relate to Stuart.”20 Older guys seek the thrill of beating the market as well. A financial advisor told me about clients, a retired successful trader on the commodities exchange and his wife. The wife wanted a conservative well-diversified portfolio but her husband wanted to win the beat-the-market game by investing in Mongolian real estate. They did not stay clients long. “It was not a good fit,” said the advisor. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1315))

- Institutional investors are no less eager to play the beat-the-market game than individual investors, and they are not much better at it. Pension fund trustees compete with fellow fund trustees in market timing and selection of money managers. But, on average, pension funds would have earned higher utilitarian returns if they had stuck with index funds.23 Yet pension funds and other institutional investors do not quit the beat-the-market game. Instead, they play performance games. “I did beat the market,” they say, “if you measure my performance right.” There was a time when the 100-meter dash was measured in seconds, and crossing the ten-second barrier was the goal. Runners are not much faster now, but we have better stop-watches. Now we measure time by one-hundreds’ of seconds, and running records continue to be broken. Investors are not running any faster in the beat-the-market race, so efforts go to inventing better performance measures. Many performance measures are vying for the role of the ultimate performance stopwatch, but the confidence that an accurate performance stopwatch exists is gone. It might be good if we would be granted a moratorium from performance games until we perfect a stopwatch. But that will never happen; the race is too tempting, and the desire to win is too strong. So individual investors continue to jump from mutual fund to mutual fund in search of winners, and institutional ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1339))

- Mental accounting is common to all, from lottery buyers in Florida, to prostitutes in Oslo, and even members of gangs in Philadelphia. Some of the Oslo prostitutes placed wages, welfare money, and health benefits in straight-life mental accounts, allocating it carefully for straight-life expenses such as rent. But they placed prostitution money in fast-life mental accounts. Fast-life money was burning holes in the women’s pockets, and they spent it quickly on drugs, alcohol, and clothes. One prostitute said: “Trick money is worthless. I’m a lot more careful with the [money] I get every two weeks on my job then with the money I’ve earned on the street.”1 ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1694))

- Working-class men and women practice mental accounting as well. “I have a silly little system,” said one woman in the 1950s, describing her tincan mental accounting. “Whenever my husband gets paid I take away so much for my grocery money and put it in my kitchen drawer. Then I take all the rest and I put it into a tin can. . . . If my husband doesn’t have enough money for gas out of his allowance, or if we go out for some entertainment, we just take the money out of the tin can. . . . I’ve tried to budget with envelopes, labeling them for this and that, but we always took money out of the wrong envelope whenever we ran low. . . . Now I’ve found the checking account together with the tin can the best system.”5 ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1709))

Mr. Sage simply wanted the money.” Sage left home to pick up some shoes he left to be patched by the cobbler. “He didn’t send the butler because Mr. Sage believed in carrying all money transactions personally. In his hand he held fifty cents to pay the cobbler. The sidewalk was icy, and Mr. Sage slipped, fell, and the fifty-cent piece rolled away. He spent some time pawing around in the dark looking for it. In the end he found not only the fifty cents, but also thirty-five cents more that somebody else had lost in the same place.”38 ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=1878))

- Spouses bolster self-control. Men across many countries view women as better budgeters, possessing greater self-control.17, 18, 19 The majority of men in the Philippines reported in a survey that they would be profli-gate in spending if their wives did not control their incomes. Men in the Philippines often keep some of their incomes from their wives surreptitiously, a practice so common it has a name, Kupit, which literally means to pilfer, filch, or steal in small quantities. Female empowerment is not only a worthy goal on its own but also the road to the goal of increased saving. A study in the Philippines found that savings accounts that commit their holders to save enhance both savings and the power of women in decisions within families.20 ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=2023))

- Eric Stein, a scam artist, promised investors 20 to 25 percent in 90 days. Before he was caught, Stein defrauded almost 1,800 investors of $34 million. Sitting in prison, Stein said: “Truth is, 25 percent on a quarterly basis is impossible—can’t happen. But you’re not going to believe that it can’t happen. Because you want to believe that it can happen. . . .” Entrepreneurs were eager to hand over their money, including owners of car dealerships, owners of golf courses, and restauranteurs. So were doctors, and especially dentists. “They’re risk takers. [Some] guys—we call them “hard money” or a “mooch”—just like to play it really big,” said Stein. “We know for a fact that he’s going to tell his friends that he’s in this huge deal. . . . We used to call it “golf course talk.” So, you’re playing the psychological aspect as well as the financial aspect.”1 ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049SOOOM&location=2341))

- But Emily Cikovsky and Abbe Peterson had choices and bore responsibility for outcomes. Responsibility opens the gate to pride as it opens it to regret, but the pain of regret when our choices turn out poorly is greater than the joy of pride when our choices turn out well. Hindsight error adds to the burden of responsibility since it makes it seem as if the outcomes of choices were clear in foresight, not only in hindsight.
