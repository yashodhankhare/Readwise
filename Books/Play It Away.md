## Highlights
- That was how I wanted all of my meetups to be from that point forward. I just had to ask myself, What games can we play together? ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=353))

- That’s when I signed up for something I’d always been too scared to do: improv comedy classes. For three hours each week, I thrust myself into situations where I was guaranteed to look foolish. At first, I was really nervous and slightly mortified. My heart beat rapidly and my voice quivered whenever I performed in front of 15 other people. But by the end of the first month, improv was a tremendous source of strength for me. And it was the most fun I’d had in years.

- Life was a game, and I always allowed myself to play. I wanted it to be that way again. Then I realized... it could be. In fact, it always had been. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=384))

- It took me a long time to see it, but I finally realized: I really don’t function well when I approach life as Work. I have to think of life as Play. Otherwise I take everything way too seriously, my health and happiness plummet, and the work I produce is awful. When I tackle my work with a sense of play — voluntarily, because I’m inherently attracted to it — my creativity and optimism soar. I fall in love with the process. My playful energy becomes contagious, and I’m able to create unique art with the people around me. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=387))

- Play is the creator of joy. It’s the source of fun and love, where our subconscious naturally guides us. Play is the state where we are truly ourselves, once we let go of our egos and fear of looking stupid. It’s what facilitates our best friendships, our most treasured memories, and ultimately, our enjoyment of life.

- After I did the Remove Your Anchors exercise, it finally dawned on me: my fear of an imaginary future was destroying my ability to enjoy the present. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=558))

- The information you allow into your conscious awareness determines the quality of your life. In other words, you are what you think. If you are subsisting on content that’s unsettling, anxious, and soulless (see: the news, reality shows, horror movies, books written by hateful authors, porn), your mind will become stressed, scared, and cynical. But if you are consuming content that’s joyous and playful, your mind will become happy and loving. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=570))

- Cut out any substance you regularly consume that’s correlated with increased feelings of anxiety. Common culprits include: caffeine, aspartame, refined sugar, alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. Keep it out of your body for one week. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=596))

- A vampire is someone who drains your energy when you interact with them. You can recognize a vampire just by recognizing your body’s overwhelmingly negative responses to them. When you get a message from a vampire, your stomach drops. When you’re hanging out with a vampire, you feel tense and angry. When you leave a vampire’s presence, you feel relieved and exhausted. When you run into a vampire in public, your first impulse is to avoid eye contact and hide. Like all human beings, vampires have redeemable qualities. But their positive traits are heavily outweighed by how weak, afraid, and awful you feel around them. You can never relax or be yourself around a vampire, because you’re too busy trying to avoid their emotional assault. Vampires fuel your anxiety, and at some point, you need to say “Enough.” ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=622))

- The solution for removing this anchor became very clear: stop doing work that doesn’t matter to you. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=659))

- The first step was to change how I thought about work. Rather than viewing work as a stressful obligation or a means of getting rich, my work was just a game I was choosing to play. This subtle shift immediately snapped me out of my bad habit of accepting work I didn’t care about. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IACZECE&location=664))

- I started setting aside 20 minutes each day to work on a project I cared about. This ensured that I was regularly practicing my favorite games, even if I wasn’t being paid. The project could be as small as repairing a leaky sink, or drawing a funny picture, or practicing guitar… Giving myself at least 20 minutes each day to work on something personally rewarding was enough to make me happy.

- Work shouldn’t feel like indentured servitude; it should feel like a game you would willingly play because it’s rewarding and it energizes you. The good news is that your work can be a game, so long as you allow yourself to view it through that lens.

- need to do is give yourself permission to have fun by working on things you enjoy each day. Continually putting up with work that you hate is a path that leads to unhappiness and regret. If you find yourself spending months or years working on things you dislike — due to your fear of quitting someone else’s game — it’s probably time to rethink how you want to live your life.
