## Highlights
- In dealing with kids, employees, and spouses with ADD—NO YELLING! Many people with ADD have low activity in the front part of their brains, due to lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. As a way to feel more alert they often find themselves seeking conflict or excitement. They can be masterful at making other people mad or angry at them. Do not lose your temper with them, because it often makes things worse. If they get you to explode, their unconscious, low- energy frontal cortex turns on and unconsciously they come to crave it. Never let your anger be their medication. They can get addicted to it. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=224))

- I like to start any lecture about ADD by talking about its many strengths. People with ADD are often highly intelligent, competent, and successful. It is well known that many CEOs have ADD and they tend to thrive when they hire people to keep them on track and organized. People with ADD often make wonderful writers, artists, and salespeople. There is a high incidence of people with ADD among certain professions, such as ER physicians and trauma nurses. They tend to be people who run toward fires, as opposed to people like me who tend to run away from dangerous situations. In wartime, ADD people tend to be our heroes because they are better able to throw caution to the wind, but in peacetime that same trait can get them into trouble. Never let the idea that you have ADD hold you back from reaching for your dreams or be an excuse on why you cannot get there.

- The long-term outcome of having untreated ADD is becoming clearer, and it is not good news. Untreated ADD increases the risk of depression, drug abuse, obesity, smoking, Type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.

- ADD is the most common learning and behavior problem in children. But the issue doesn’t end there: It is also one of the most common problems in adults, and has been associated with job failures, relationship breakups, loneliness, a tremendous sense of underachievement, drug abuse, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Despite its prevalence, many myths and misconceptions about ADD abound in our society. Here are just a few of them: ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=391))

- Many people with ADD are never hyperactive. The non-hyperactive or “inattentive” ADD folks are often ignored because they do not bring enough negative attention to themselves. Many of these ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=408))

- children, teenagers, or adults earn the unjust labels “willful,” “lazy,” “unmotivated,” or “not that smart.” Females, in our experience, tend to have inattentive ADD, and it often devastates their lives. Left untreated or ineffectively treated ADD is a very serious societal problem! ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=409))

- 75 percent have interpersonal problems; untreated ADD sufferers have a higher percentage of motor vehicle accidents, speeding tickets, citations for driving without a license, and suspended or revoked licenses.

- The harder many people with ADD try, the worse things get for them. Brain-imaging studies show that when people with ADD try to concentrate, the parts of their brains involved with concentration, focus, and follow-through (prefrontal cortex and cerebellum) actually shut down—just when they need them to turn on. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=425))

- five percent of children diagnosed with ADD will have disabling symptoms into adulthood. Treatment can be very effective when properly targeted, especially when using a comprehensive approach, including education, support, exercise, nutrition, and personalized supplements or medications.

- As you’ll see in the pages that follow, ADD affects many areas of the brain, primarily the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (the brain’s controllers of concentration, attention span, judgment, organization, planning, and impulse control), the anterior cingulate gyrus (the brain’s gear shifter and place of error detection), the temporal lobes (involved in memory, learning, and emotional reactions), the basal ganglia (which produce the neurotransmitter dopamine that drives the prefrontal cortex), and the deep limbic system (involved with setting emotional tone and bonding). But the good news is that with targeted treatment, people with ADD often get much better. Before-and-after imaging shows that, with effective treatment, brain function can dramatically improve and give sufferers more access to their own abilities. Effective treatment does not make ADD sufferers different people: It removes the barriers hindering them from being the people they already are. I think of effective treatment for ADD like glasses for people who have trouble seeing. The glasses do not change people, they just make their vision more effective.

- Type 3: Overfocused ADD—sufferers tend to have trouble shifting attention, which makes them look like they cannot pay attention; they frequently get stuck in loops of negative thoughts or behaviors; can be obsessive, worried, and inflexible; and are frequently oppositional, argumentative, and fault finding. Opposed to most ADD types, their organization is often fine or in some cases they are obsessively organized. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=455))

- Often, the brighter the child, the later he or she is diagnosed. Up until that time, the child is likely to be labeled as an underachiever, willful, defiant, or oppositional. At one time, it was believed that ADD symptoms disappeared by puberty. However, current studies indicate that only 25 to 50 percent of ADD kids fully outgrow their symptoms by puberty. Many do not outgrow their symptoms and they have difficulty with their family, school, and/or the community. This misperception occurred in part because most ADD children outgrow the hyperactive component before or at puberty. The problems with inattention and impulsivity remain, and many teenagers are taken off their medication just at a time when their defiant behavior is at its peak. I have seen that many teens experience serious school and social failure after the pediatrician or family doctor prematurely takes them off their medication. There is a high incidence of conflicts in ADD families, especially during the teenage years. These conflicts often center around failure to do schoolwork, problems completing routine chores, and difficulty being trusted to obey the rules. I have seen many teenagers sent away from home (to a residential treatment setting, boarding school, or relative’s house) as a way for the family to survive the turmoil. Many adults with ADD live lives of chronic frustration. Psychiatrists Henry Mann and Stanley Greenspan wrote the first article on ADD in adults in 1977, yet the medical community was very slow to recognize ADD in adults. It has only been since the late 1980s that professionals began talking about ADD beyond the adolescent years. Still, even now many professionals do not understand ADD in adults and often describe these people as having character problems, anxiety, depression, or even manic-depressive disorder. Their childhood ADD symptoms are assumed to have just melted away. Adults with ADD often come to our clinic with the following concerns: ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=618))

- GREGG When Gregg first came to see me at the age of fourteen, he was a wreck. He had just been expelled from his third school for fighting and breaking the rules. He told off teachers for fun and picked fights with other kids on the school grounds. He also never did his homework and he talked about dropping out of school, saying he didn’t need an education to take care of himself. At home he was defiant, restless, messy, and disobedient. He teased his younger brother and sister without mercy. Anytime his parents would speak to him, he’d get defensive and challenging. His parents were at their wits’ end, and their next step was a residential treatment center. When I first saw him he was a “turned-off” teenager with averted eyes and nothing much to say. He told me that he didn’t want to be sent away but that he wasn’t able to get along with his family. He found school very hard and thought he was stupid. When I did a test of verbal intelligence on him, however, his demeanor started ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=709))

- to change. He liked the test and seemed challenged by it. His verbal IQ score was 142, in the superior range and far from stupid. Looking back in Gregg’s history, it was clear he had had symptoms of ADD his whole life. He was a fidgety kid with awful handwriting and a messy desk. He had trouble waiting his turn in school, and endured being called stupid because he had trouble learning. Due to the severity of his problems, and the potential departure of Gregg from the family, I ordered a brain SPECT study to evaluate the functioning of his brain. The study showed that he had two problems. When Gregg tried to concentrate, the front part of his brain, which should increase in activity, actually decreased. This is the part of the brain that controls attention span, judgment, impulse control, and critical thinking. His brain study also showed decreased activity in his left temporal lobe, which, when abnormal, often causes problems with learning, and sometimes violent or aggressive behavior. I diagnosed Gregg with Temporal Lobe ADD. As I explained these findings to Gregg, he became visibly relieved. “You mean,” he said, “the harder I try to concentrate, the worse it gets for me.” He responded very nicely to a combination of medication to balance ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=716))

Brett had trouble with details, he was often late to work, he seemed disorganized, and he would miss important deadlines. The end came when he impulsively told off a difficult customer who complained about his attitude. All his life Brett had similar problems, and his mother was tired of bailing him out. He dropped out of school in the eleventh grade, despite having been found to have a high IQ. He was restless, fidgety, impulsive, and… ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=728))

- People with ADD have problems paying attention to regular, routine, everyday matters such as homework, schoolwork, chores, or paperwork—problems that have plagued them their whole lives. The mundane is terrible for them and not by choice. As we will see later on, they need excitement or interest to stimulate an underactive brain.

- In addition to clinical history (from family and friends as well as the person being evaluated), our office also uses the Conner’s Continuous Performance Task (C-CPT), to measure attention span and impulse control to aid in making the diagnosis of ADD. The Conner’s CPT is a computer-based fifteen-minute test of attention, response time, and impulse control. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=812))

- Distractibility differs from a short attention span. The issue here is not an inability to sustain attention, but rather a hypersensitivity to the environment. Most of us can block out unnecessary environmental stimuli: traffic sounds, the sound of the air conditioner or heater turning on, the smell of food from the cafeteria, birds flying by the classroom window, even the feel of our own clothing against our skin. People with ADD, however, are often hypersensitive to their senses, and they have trouble suppressing the sounds, sights, smells, and feel of the environment—the sensory noise that surrounds us. The distractibility is likely due to the underlying mechanism of ADD, underactivity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain.

- People with Type 3 Overfocused ADD often appear very organized on the outside. They are often perfectly dressed, and parts of their living spaces may be very neat. For example, they may insist on perfect living rooms, but if you go into their drawers or their closets, you’ll find a disaster.

- Similarly, time organization plagues people with ADD. They tend to be late and have trouble predicting how long things will take them to do. Often they will agree to do too many things at once, not realizing the time commitment involved. The chronic tardiness lands many ADD people in deep trouble. For example, they get fired from jobs for being late to work, not once, but on a chronic basis. Many of my patients’ spouses have told me that they have to lie in order to be on time for appointments or engagements. “If I tell her we have to leave at noon, invariably she won’t be ready until 12:30 or 1:00 P.M. It makes me so mad! So in order for me not to feel so stressed out I tell her we have to leave at 11:00. She hasn’t caught on yet.” ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=866))

- People with ADD frequently suffer from poor follow-through, lacking the staying power to see projects through to the end. They will do something so long as there is intense interest. In addition, they put things off until the very last minute—until the looming deadline generates enough stress to entice them to get it done.

- Many people with ADD will complete 50 to 80 percent of their task and then go off to another project. They frequently get distracted by other things and fail to follow through with the task at hand. Many people with ADD pay late fees on bills, even though they had the money to pay the bill on time.

- The moment is what matters. This phrase comes up over and over with my ADD patients. For many people with ADD, forethought is a struggle. It is natural for them to act out what is important to them at the immediate moment, not two moments from now or five moments from now, but now! A person with ADD may be ready for work a few minutes early, but rather than leave the house and be on time or a few minutes early, she may do another couple of things that make her late. Likewise, a person with ADD may be sexually attracted to someone he just met, and even though he is married and his personal goal is to stay married, he may have a sexual encounter that puts his marriage at risk. The moment was what mattered. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=911))

- As far as excess television is concerned, the research is compelling: Kids who watch the most TV do the worst in school. TV is a “no brain” activity. Everything is provided to the brain (sounds, sights, plots, outcome, entertainment), so it doesn’t have to work to learn or make new connections. Like a muscle, the more you use your brain, the stronger it becomes and the more it can do. The opposite is also true: The less you work it, the weaker it becomes. Repeatedly engaging in “no brain” activities, such as TV, decreases a person’s ability to focus. In addition, the pacing of TV has changed over the ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=951))

- 2. Waist to Height Ratio (WHtR). Another way to measure the health of your weight is the “waist-to-height ratio.” Some researchers believe this number is even more accurate than BMI. The WHtR is calculated by dividing waist size by height. For an example, a female with a 32-inch waist who is 5 feet, 10 inches (70 inches) would divide 32 by 70 to get a WHtR of 45.7 percent. To be healthy your waist size in inches should be less than half your height. So, if you are 66 inches tall, your waist should not be more than 33 inches. If you are 72 inches tall, your waist should not be more than 36 inches. The WHtR is thought to give a more accurate assessment of health ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=1238))

- since the most dangerous place to carry weight is in the abdomen. Fat in the abdomen, which is associated with a larger waist, is metabolically active and produces various hormones that can cause harmful effects, such as diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. You have to actually measure your waist size with a tape measure! Going by your pants size does not count, as many clothing manufacturers actually make their sizes larger than they state on the label so as not to offend their customers. In my experience, 90 percent of people will underestimate their waist circumference. Don’t lie to yourself. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=1243))

- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is marked by a person with obsessions (repetitive negative thoughts) and/or compulsions (repetitive negative behaviors), which interfere with their lives. People with OCD get “stuck” or “locked in” to negative thoughts or behaviors. In my clinical experience, there is a high percentage of people with ADD who also have features of OCD, especially if there is significant alcohol abuse in their family backgrounds. The overfocused subtype of ADD has many features in common with OCD, ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=1358))

Their eyes are shaped funny and we wear glasses to focus. For people who have ADD, they are not dumb, crazy, or stupid. Their prefrontal cortex shuts down, when it should turn on. And they need treatment to keep their prefrontal cortex working properly, so they can focus.” ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=1467))

- I am frequently asked how I differentiate people with this type of ADD from people who have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). That is easy. All three groups have overfocused tendencies (anterior cingulate issues), but people with Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD also have long-standing core ADD symptoms: short attention span, distractibility, spotty organization, poor follow-through, and poor internal supervision. People with OCD have clear obsessive thoughts and/or compulsive behaviors, such as repetitively checking locks or hand washing. People with OCPD have difficult personality traits—such as emotional rigidity, an “anal” need for sameness, the need to have their way, and compulsive cleanliness—but generally do not have core ADD symptoms.

- DIFFERENTIATING TYPE 6 RING OF FIRE ADD FROM BIPOLAR DISORDER Differentiating this type of ADD from bipolar disorder is generally difficult in children and easy in adults. Until recently, child psychiatrists didn’t think that children had bipolar disorder. They thought that it was a disorder of older adolescence and adulthood. New information has shown that this disorder does occur in children and that it is sometimes very hard to distinguish between it and severe ADD. Bipolar children tend to cycle in their mood and behavior problems. They have times when they are awful, irritable, and aggressive, and they have times when things are relatively normal. Ring of Fire ADD kids tend to have problems on a consistent basis. In order to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder as an adult, the person needs to have a manic episode (pressured speech, trouble sitting still, irritability, decreased need for sleep, grandiose ideas, periods of hypersexuality or hyperreligiosity, extreme impulsivity, and sometimes even psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations or delusions). People with Ring of Fire ADD do not have manic episodes. Their behavior tends to be consistent over long periods of time. People can have both Ring of ([Location 2774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=2774))

- Many people do not fully understand how head injuries—sometimes even “minor” ones, in which no loss of consciousness occurs—can alter a person’s character and ability to learn. We see head injuries so often on the SPECT studies we order in our ADD patients that we are tempted to add an eighth type of ADD: Head Injury ADD. Post–head injury symptoms often consist of attention problems, memory difficulties, and decreased energy and motivation. In head-injury-induced ADD, the symptoms follow a significant head injury and frequently look like one of the types of ADD. If the injury just affected the prefrontal cortex, it could look like Type 1 or Type 2. If the injury affected the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes (common because of the location of the temporal lobes), it could look like Type 4. If the injury damaged the anterior cingulate gyrus, it could look like Type 3. The treatment depends on the clinical picture. We have seen anticonvulsants help to stabilize temporal lobe symptoms, and stimulants or stimulating supplements help prefrontal cortex symptoms.

- ADD is a generational disorder, meaning having ADD in a family significantly influences the development of each member. The level of influence is often determined by which parent has ADD, whether it is the father or mother. ADD mothers often have a more negative impact on children than ADD fathers, as they are still often the primary caretakers for children. In addition, ADD influences parenting, job choices, creativity, moves, and legal issues. Here are three examples of ADD across generations.

- Drug and alcohol abuse are very common problems in teenagers and adults with untreated ADD. One study from researchers at Harvard reported 52 percent of untreated ADD adults abuse drugs or alcohol. The drugs that they choose to abuse are alcohol and marijuana to settle the internal restlessness they feel, and cocaine and methamphetamines to feel more energetic and focused. Nicotine use (cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco) is much more common in people with ADD, as is the use of large amounts of caffeine. Nicotine and caffeine are mild stimulants.

- they engage in these behaviors, but I have seen these games in my own family and I’ve heard about them from my patients for many years. Let’s look at each of these games in depth. “LET’S HAVE A PROBLEM” Without enough stimulation, the brain looks for ways to increase its own activity. Being mad, upset, angry, or negative has an immediate stimulating effect on the brain. Whenever you get upset your body produces increasing amounts of adrenaline stimulating heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and, yes, brain activity. Many people with ADD pick on others to get a rise out of them, to get them upset, to make them crazy. So often family members of my patients tell me they are tired of the problems in their families. They say, “I’m so tired of fighting with my brother [sister, mother, father, son, daughter, etc.]. Why does there have to be this turmoil? Can’t he [she] be happy with peaceful coexistence? Why does he [she] always have to fight? He [She] always has to Have a Problem.” ([Location 3201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=3201))

- “I BET I CAN GET YOU TO YELL AT ME OR HIT ME” A similar game to “Let’s Have a Problem” is “I Bet I Can Get You to Yell at Me or Hit Me.” Many people with ADD are masterful at getting others to scream, yell, spank, and basically get out of control. They get others so upset, that they cannot help but lose it. These negative behaviors provide quite an adrenaline rush, but frequently lead to serious negative consequences, such as divorce, fights at school, being fired from a job, and even abuse. Again, the game is unconscious, not planned. It seems as if the ADD person senses the most vulnerable issues for others and they work on them until there is an explosion. Here are three examples.

- “MY THOUGHTS ARE MORE TERRIBLE THAN YOUR THOUGHTS” Psychiatrist and brain imaging specialist Mark George demonstrated, in a landmark study, that negative thoughts have an overall stimulating effect on the brain. Using functional brain imaging studies, he looked at brain activity while people were thinking about something neutral, something positive, and something awful. The neutral thoughts did not change brain activity. The positive thoughts actually cooled overall brain activity, especially in the limbic area of the brain (certainly not good for ADD folks who have poor brain activity). The negative thoughts brought overall brain activation, especially in the limbic areas (making them more depressed) and in the prefrontal cortex (helping them focus).

- Clinically, I have seen that many ADD people seem to be experts at picking out the most negative thoughts possible and staying focused on them for prolonged periods of time. It is almost as if they need the negativity to have the mental energy to get work done. When I started to talk about this idea to colleagues at my clinic Jonathan, a marriage, family, and child therapist who has ADD, said, “I think I do that myself. I wake up thinking about the most horrific things that could happen during the day. I feel anxious, but it motivates me to get up and get moving.” You have probably noticed the people who play this game at work. If ten good things and one bad thing happen, most of the thoughts are focused on the bad thing. These are the people at work who complain, gossip, find fault, undermine, and pit people against each other. As managers, they are often the ones who notice the negative much more than the positive. The negativity that is often associated with ADD frequently ruins lives. Few are drawn closer to people who are negative, complaining, or filled with anxious thoughts. Many ADD people who unknowingly play this game end up isolated, lonely, depressed, and even more negative.

He started the meeting by complaining about a front office issue, without first wanting to know why I asked to see him.

- Without a sense of personal power people often feel overwhelmed and hopeless. Billie Jean came into my office complaining about nearly everything in her life. Her husband mistreated her, her children neglected her, her boss was mean to her, and her doctor (not me thankfully) didn’t take her seriously. When she was late to an appointment it was because of traffic; when she missed a payment it was because she hadn’t gotten her mail. There was just an excuse for everything. Gently, I started to ask her what she could do to make these situations better—with her husband, children, job, and organizing her life. I felt it was critical for her emotional health. Unless she took responsibility for her emotions and reactions, she would always be at the mercy of others. I felt that her tendency to blame was a way to become angry and entitled so that she could use the anger as a stimulant. I began teaching her this concept, which, through therapy, she recognized as a common operant factor in her life. Eliminating blame and asking herself, “What can I do to make the situation better?” was one of the most important parts of her healing process. For example, she used to frequently complain that her children treated her with disrespect. She would yell, scream, cry, and carry on about how badly she was treated. When she asked herself, “What can I do to make the situation better?” she realized that her lax, but hostile parenting style (with poor follow-through—very common in ADD mothers) actually contributed to the problem and that she had to become firmer with the children—without the emotional outpouring that only made the situation worse. By taking responsibility and charge of the situation she was able to make a very positive difference. It is very important to watch out for the “It’s Your Fault” game. It may ruin your life. “NO, NO WAY, NEVER, YOU CAN’T MAKE ME DO IT” Opposition probably also increases adrenaline in the ADD brain.

They tell me they have no idea why they do it. It is not their goal to be oppositional. Some time ago, I had a very interesting session. I saw a ten-year-old boy for the first time. He came into my office with his mother. He immediately sat down on my blue leather coach and put his shoes on the coach (which didn’t bother me, I figure if you see difficult kids you have to have an office that will stand up to them). But the shoes on the coach did bother his mother. She told him to put them down. When he refused, she put them down on the floor. He immediately put them back up on the sofa. She looked at me in frustration and then moved her son’s feet back on the floor. He put them up. She put them down. He put them up again. She put them down again and slapped his leg. This went on and on. I watched to see the interaction between them. He wanted his way.

He said, like so many of these kids do, “I don’t know.” The unconscious game of “No, No Way, Never, You Can’t Make Me Do It” can ruin someone’s life. The level of opposition often drives others away, causing them to make negative judgments about you and emotionally push you away. While writing this book, I went to Israel to speak at an international ADD conference. While at the conference I had the pleasure to spend time with a family who had come to see me in California.

- Drive Toward Turmoil ADD children and teenagers are often experts at getting their parents to yell at them. As I mentioned above, the ADD person often has decreased activity in their frontal lobes and they “unconsciously” seek stimulation to feel more awake or alert. In a family, this takes on many forms, such as temper tantrums, noise, and high activity. Parental Splitting ADD kids may also be skilled at getting their parents to fight with each other. Splitting parental authority gives children and teenagers too much power and increases the turmoil. Often the scenario is that the mother will blame the father for being “too absent” or “too harsh,” and the father will blame the mother for being “too inconsistent” and “too soft.” Of course, this goes both ways. I have seen many couples separate, in part, to stop the turmoil they lived in at home.

Yet, it is all too common in ADD families. Isolation: “Everyone thinks I’m a bad parent. No one else has these problems.

He missed deadlines, seemed to drift off in meetings, and he was often late to work. He knew that his wife would be angry with him. This was the third job he had lost in their three-year marriage. As a child, Bill had taken Ritalin for troubles in school, but he was taken off the medication when he was a teenager. His doctor told him that all kids outgrow the problems he was having. That was bad advice. At the age of thirty-two, Bill still suffered from the effects of ADD. When ADD is left untreated, it significantly affects the workplace. It costs employers millions of dollars every year in decreased productivity, absenteeism, and employee conflicts. Yet ADD remains vastly underdiagnosed, especially in adults. There is both a positive and negative side to ADD in the workplace. People with ADD often are high in energy, enthusiastic, full of ideas, and creative. If they surround themselves with people who organize them and manage the details, they can be very successful. In my clinical practice, I treat many highly successful ADD executives.

- The Harder They Try, the Worse It Gets Research has shown that the more ADD people try to concentrate, the worse it gets for them. Their brain region responsible for concentrated thinking turns off, not on. When a supervisor or manager puts more pressure on them to perform, they often fall off in their work. Then the boss interprets this decreased performance as willful misconduct, and serious problems arise. I once treated a man with ADD who was a ship welder. He told me that whenever his boss put pressure on him to do a better job, his work got worse (even though he really tried to do better). When the boss told him that he liked his work, he became more productive. In supervising someone with ADD, it is much more effective to use praise and encouragement, rather than pressure. Distractibility Distractibility is often evident in meetings. People with ADD tend to look around the room, drift off, appear bored, forget where the conversation is going, and interrupt with extraneous information. The distractibility and short attention span may also cause them to take much longer to complete their work than their coworkers. They are often very frustrating to managers and coworkers. Forgetfulness Forgetfulness is common in ADD and a serious handicap on the job. Missed deadlines, forgotten reports, and steps gone undone on a job are just a few examples. Impulsivity Often, the lack of impulse control gets the ADD person fired. They may say inappropriate things to supervisors, other employees, or customers. I once had a patient who was fired from thirteen jobs because he had trouble controlling his mouth. Even though he really wanted to keep several of the jobs, he would just blurt out what he was thinking before he had a chance to process the thought. Impulsivity also leads to poor decision making. Rather than thinking a problem through, impulsive people want an immediate solution to the problem and act without the necessary forethought. Similarly, the impulsivity causes these people to have trouble going through the established channels at work. They often go right to the top to solve problems, rather than working through the system. This may cause resentments from their coworkers and immediate supervisors. Impulsivity also may lead to such problem behaviors as lying and stealing. I have treated many ADD people who have suffered with the shame and guilt of these behaviors. Conflict Seeking Many people with ADD are in constant turmoil with one or more people at work. They seem to “unconsciously” pick out people who are vulnerable to verbally spar with. They also have a tendency to embarrass others, which does not endear them to anyone. Shades of the grown-up version of the class clown are also evident at work, such as cracking inappropriate jokes in meetings. Conflict may follow the ADD person from job to job. Disorganization Disorganization is a hallmark of ADD and it can be particularly damaging in the workplace.

They may overvalue themselves and think they are better at their jobs than they really are, or they may devalue important assets that they have. Switches Things Around: Many people with ADD have a tendency to switch things around This happens with letters or numbers, even phrases or paragraphs. You can imagine the problems this can cause at work. Switching numbers on a phone message can cause many wrong numbers. Reading letters backwards can give different meaning to content. Twisting information from a meeting can cause serious misunderstandings.

- Tendency Toward Addictions People with ADD have a tendency toward addictions, such as food, alcohol, drugs, even work. Drug or alcohol addictions cause obvious work problems. Food addictions cause health and self-image problems which can impact work. Addiction to work is also a serious problem, because it causes burnout and family problems that eventually show up in the workplace. Spends Excessive Time at Work Because of Inefficiencies The symptoms of ADD frequently cause a person to be inefficient on their job. This causes many people with ADD to put in overtime that managers consider excessive. This may result in a poor job evaluation or firing. To avoid these problems, many people with ADD… ([Location 3599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=3599))

- Frequent Conflict Many ADD sufferers have been in conflict either with their parents, friends, or teachers over and over for years. This causes them to develop negative “self-talk” patterns and low self-esteem. Negative Input The difficult behavior associated with ADD often incites negative input from others. “Don’t do that.” “Why did you do that?” “Where was your head?” “What’s wrong with you?” “Your brother doesn’t act like that!” “You’d do better if you would try harder.” “Shame on you!” These are common phrases many ADD children hear on a regular basis. Constant negative input turns into low self-esteem. Inaccurate Self-Assessment As mentioned above, people with ADD are often a poor judge of their own ability. They often devalue their strengths and positive attributes, focusing only on their failures. Chronic Failure Most people with ADD have had many failure experiences in life, school, relationships, and work. These failures set them up to expect failure, and whenever a person expects that they will fail, they don’t try their best or they don’t try at all. Negative Bonding ADD often causes negative bonding with parents. Bonding is critical to the emotional health of human beings. Yet, by the time many ADD children are school age, they have such a negative relationship with their parents that they begin not to care about other people, which sets them up for societal problems. Without bonding, people do not care about others, and when a person doesn’t care, he or she has… ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=3607))

Brain Filters When people do not feel good about themselves, it impairs their ability to relate to others. They have difficulty taking compliments or getting outside of themselves to truly understand the other person. The brain filters information coming in from the environment. When the brain’s filter (self-esteem) is negative, people tend to only see the negative and ignore any positive. Many partners of ADD people complain that when they give their partner a compliment they find a way to make it look like they have just been criticized.

- Behaviorally, many children, teens, and adults learn to get other people upset with their difficult behavior. They learn, on a purely unconscious and biological level, that when there is turmoil between people, it stimulates their brain, making them feel more alert and awake. They do not know this on a conscious level and would, in fact, deny that they ever do it. But when you watch these people with their parents or in social situations, their behavior seems goal-directed toward turmoil. After listening to hundreds of mothers, I’m convinced that this is a technique to treat underlying brain deactivation with turmoil, as an alcoholic may treat underlying restlessness or anxiety with alcohol.

- because of the trouble getting up. Adults with ADD also have this problem. Have you ever heard of adults who say that they have to have a couple of cups of coffee in the morning to get going? Coffee contains the stimulant caffeine. (Stimulants are common treatment for ADD.) Parents complain that they have to wake up ADD children and teenagers three, four, five, six, even ten times before they get out of bed. This can cause a lot of family turmoil in the morning. When parents have to tell a child over and over to get out of bed, they can get pretty irritable. They may start yelling, threatening, or using force to get the child moving. Some parents we know use water or ice to help the child or teen get up. The morning grogginess causes many people with ADD to be chronically late, which stresses out everyone in the morning, especially if the parent has to get to work or has other children to get to school. The child or teen who wakes up to parent hostility starts the day off in a bad mood. It’s hard to concentrate in class when you have just been yelled at, threatened, or grounded because you couldn’t get out of bed on time. This also leads to other problems. For example, if you can’t get up on time, you may miss the bus, get a speeding ticket, end up in the tardy tank, or just cut class so that you’re not late again.

Many ADD people say that when they get up on their own, they tend to do better than if someone is screaming at them to get out of bed. It often becomes a battle of wills. Both people end up feeling terrible. Without parents hassling kids, some children and teenagers don’t get out of bed until noon, 1:00, 2:00, or even 3:00 P.M.. This can cause serious problems. When kids get up late, they will have trouble going to sleep at night. Getting up late causes a large part of the day to go by without participating in it. Many parents complain that their kids are wasting the day. ([Location 5110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5110))

- one suggestion will work for everyone, but keep trying new tactics until you find what works for your situation: 1. Don’t watch television one to two hours before bedtime, especially any program that may be overstimulating (i.e., the shows you most like). This includes news programs, as people with ADD tend to ruminate on the bad things that happened that day in their own world and the world at large. 2. Stimulating, active play such as wrestling, tickling, teasing, etc., should be eliminated for one to two hours before bedtime. Quiet activities such as reading, drawing, or writing are more helpful in the hours before bedtime. 3. Some people try to read themselves to sleep. This can be helpful. But read boring books. If you read action-packed thrillers or horror stories you are not likely to drift off into peaceful never-never land. 4. Try a warm, quiet bath. 5. A bedtime back rub in bed may be soothing. Starting from the neck and working down in slow, rhythmic strokes can be very relaxing.

Some people with ADD say that they need fast music in order to block out their thoughts. Use what works. 7. Nature-sounds tapes (rain, thunder, ocean, rivers) can be very helpful. Others like the sound of fans. 8. Some people with ADD say that restrictive bedding is helpful, such as a sleeping bag or being wrapped tightly in blankets. 9.

Take three or four very slow, deep breaths. Tighten the muscles in your arms and legs and then let them relax. Imagine yourself walking down a staircase while you count backwards from ten. (This will give you the feeling of “going down” or becoming sleepy.) With all of your senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell) imagine a very sleepy scene, such as by a fire in a mountain cabin or in a sleeping bag at the beach. 12. Seek sleep control therapy.

- an electrical transmission goes across your brain, and you become aware of what you’re thinking. Thoughts are real and they have a real impact on how you feel and how you behave. STEP #2: Every time you have a mad thought, an unkind thought, a sad thought, or a cranky thought, your brain releases negative chemicals that make your body feel bad. Whenever you’re upset, imagine that your brain releases bubbles with sad or angry faces, looking to cause problems. Think about the last time you were mad. What did you feel inside your body? When most people are mad, their muscles get tense, their heart beats faster, their hands start to sweat, and they may even begin to feel a little dizzy. Your body reacts to every negative thought you have. STEP #3: Every time you have a good thought, a happy thought, a hopeful thought, or a kind thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel good. Whenever you’re happy, imagine that your brain releases bubbles with glad or smiling faces, making you feel good.

STEP #4: Your body reacts to every thought you have! We know this from polygraphs or lie detector tests.

- STEP #5: Thoughts are very powerful! They can make your mind and your body feel good or they can make you feel bad! Every cell in your body is affected by every thought you have.

He had periods of bad depression when he was a child and adult. Some days he didn’t even get out of bed. In his later life, however, he learned to treat his bad feelings with laughter. He learned that when he laughed, he felt better. STEP #6: Unless you think about your thoughts, they are “automatic” or “they just happen.” Since they just happen, they are not always correct.

- STEP #7: You can train your thoughts to be positive and hopeful or you can just allow them to be negative and upset you. Once you learn about your thoughts, you can choose to think good thoughts and feel good, or you can choose to think bad thoughts and feel lousy. That’s right, it’s up to you! You can learn how to change your thoughts and you can learn to change the way you feel. One way to learn how to change your thoughts is to notice them when they are negative and talk back to them. If you can correct negative thoughts, you take away their power over you. When you just think a negative thought without challenging it, your mind believes it and your body reacts to it. STEP #8: As I mentioned above, negative thoughts are mostly automatic. They “just happen.” I call these thoughts Automatic Negative Thoughts. If you take the first letter from each of these words, it spells the word “ANT.” Think of these negative thoughts that invade your mind like ants that bother people at a picnic.

- Whenever you notice these automatic negative thoughts (ANTs), you need to crush them or they’ll begin to ruin your whole day. One way to crush these ANTs is to write down the negative thought and talk back to it. For example, if you think, Other kids will laugh at me when I give my speech, write it down and then write down a positive response—something like The other kids will like my speech and find it interesting. When you write down negative thoughts and talk back to them, you take away their power and help yourself feel better. Some kids tell me they have trouble talking back to these negative thoughts because they feel that they are lying to themselves. Initially they believe that the thoughts that go through their mind are the truth. Remember, thoughts sometimes lie to you. It’s important to check them out before you just believe them! Here are nine different ways that our thoughts lie to us to make situations out to be worse than they really are. Think of these nine ways as different species or types of ANTs (… ([Location 5256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5256))

- ANT #1: “All or nothing” thinking. These thoughts happen when you make something out to be all good or all bad. There’s nothing in between. You see everything in black or white terms. The thought for children, “There’s nothing to do,” is an example of this. When children say “There’s nothing to do” they feel down and upset, bored, and unmotivated to change the situation. But is, There’s nothing to do, a rational thought? Of course not: It’s just a thought. Even on a day when it’s raining outside and children have to stay in, they can probably list twenty things to do if they put their minds to it. But if they never challenge the thought, There’s nothing to do, they just believe it and spend the rest of the day feeling crummy. Other examples of “all or nothing thinking” include thoughts such as, I’m the worst ball player in the city and If I get an A on this test, I’m a great student, but if I do poorly, then I’m no good at all. ANT #2: “Always” thinking. This happens when you think something that happened will “always” repeat itself. For example, if… ([Location 5265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5265))

- words like “always,” “never,” “no one,” “everyone,” “every time,” “everything,” these are examples of “always” thinking. There are many examples of “always” thinking: No one ever plays with me. Everyone is always picking on me. You never listen to me. You always give her what she wants. This type of ANT is very common. Watch out for it. ANT #3 (red ANT): Focusing on the negative. This occurs when your thoughts only see the bad in a situation and ignore any of the good that might happen. For example, if you have to move and you’re sad to leave your friends, you don’t think of the new places you’ll see and the new friends you’ll make. It’s very important, if you want to keep your mind healthy, to focus on the good parts of your life a lot more than the bad parts. I once helped a child who was depressed. In the beginning, he could only think about the bad things that happened to him. He had recently moved and told me that he would never make new friends (even though he already had several). He… ([Location 5275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5275))

- hard on himself to adjust to his new home. He would have been much better off if he looked at all the positives in the situation rather than the negatives. ANT #4 (red ANT): Fortune telling. This is where you predict the worst possible outcome to a situation. For example, before you have to give a speech in front of a class or work meeting, you might say to yourself, Other people will laugh at me or think I’m stupid. Just having this thought will make you feel nervous and upset. This is a red ANT because it can do real damage to your chances for feeling good. I once treated a ten-year-old boy named Kevin who stuttered in class whenever he read out loud. In private he was a wonderful reader, but whenever he started to read in class he thought to himself, I’m a lousy reader; the other kids will laugh at me. Because he had these thoughts, he stopped raising his hand to volunteer to read. In fact, this thought made him so upset that he started getting sick before school, and missed nearly a month of… ([Location 5284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5284))

- bad things will happen, your mind then often makes them happen: the classic self-fulfilling prophecy. The treatment for Kevin was to get him to replace those negative thoughts and pictures in his head with the image of him being a wonderful reader in class. Learning breathing techniques (we’ll cover this later) and being the designated person to answer the telephone at home also helped his confidence. Whenever you’re afraid of unreasonable things, such as answering the telephone or reading in class, it is important to face your fears. Otherwise, fears develop power over you. Over the next couple of weeks, Kevin was able to go back to school, and he even volunteered to read. His mother told me that at home he ran to answer the telephone whenever it rang. If you are going to predict anything at all, it is best to predict the best. It will help you feel good and it will help your mind make it happen. ANT #5 (red ANT): Mind reading. This happens when you believe that you know what another person is thinking when they haven’… ([Location 5293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5293))

- you are doing mind reading when you have thoughts such as, “Those people are mad at me. They don’t like me. They were talking about me.” I once treated a teenager, Dave, who had this problem so badly that he would hide in clothes racks at the shopping mall so that other kids wouldn’t see him. He told me, “If they see me, they’ll think I look funny and then they’ll want to tease me.” He became very nervous around other people because he worried about what others thought of him. He finally realized that other teenagers were more worried about themselves and they really spent little time thinking about him. Avoid reading anyone’s mind. You never know what others are thinking. ANT #6: Thinking with your feelings. This occurs when you believe your negative feelings without ever questioning them. Feelings are very complex, and, as I mentioned above, feelings sometimes lie to you. But many people believe their feelings even though they have no evidence for them. “Thinking… ([Location 5302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5302))

Here’s an example: Matt, age ten, had a problem learning and he got expelled from his school for fighting. He felt that he was stupid and that he was a bad boy. When I first met him, I diagnosed ADD and started him on medication. He also went to a new school. He did wonderful! He did so well, in fact, that his old school (which was a better school) was willing to take him back. When his mother told him this good news, he became very upset. He said that he felt that he would fail and have lots of problems. He was letting the “old” feelings from the past mess up his chances for a new start. When he corrected his negative feelings by talking back to them, he was able to return to his old school. He even made the honor roll! ANT #7: Guilt beatings. Guilt is not a helpful emotion.

- human nature, whenever we think that we “must” do something, no matter what it is, we don’t want to do it. Remember the story of Adam and Eve: The only restriction that God put on them when he gave them the Garden of Eden was that they shouldn’t eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Almost immediately after God told them what they “shouldn’t” do, they started to wonder why they shouldn’t do it. Well, you know the rest of the story. It is better to replace “guilt beatings” with phrases like I want to do this . . . It fits my goals to do that . . . It would be helpful to do this. . . . So in our examples above, it would be helpful to change those phrases to I want to be nice to my younger brother. It’s helpful for me not to lie, because people will trust me. I want to call my grandmother. It’s in my best interest to do my homework. ANT #8: Labeling. Whenever you attach a negative label to yourself or to someone else, you sabotage your ability to take a clear look at the situation. Some examples of negative labels are “nerd,” “jerk,” “idiot,” “spoiled brat,” and “clown.” Negative labels are very harmful. Whenever you call yourself or someone else a spoiled brat or an idiot, you lump that person in your mind with all of the “spoiled brats” or “idiots” that you’ve ever known and you become unable to deal with them in a reasonable way. You begin to expect the worst of them (or yourself). Stay away from negative labels. ANT #9 (the most poisonous red ANT): Blame. People who ruin their own lives have a strong tendency to blame other people when things go wrong. They take little responsibility for their problems. When something goes wrong at home, school, or work, they try to find someone to blame. They rarely admit their own problems. Typically, you’ll hear statements from them like, “It wasn’t my fault that . . . ,” “That wouldn’t have happened if you had . . . ,” “How was I supposed to know . . . ,” “It’s your fault that . . .” The bottom-line statement goes something like this: “If only you had done something differently,… ([Location 5320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5320))

SUMMARY OF ANT TYPES: “All or nothing” thinking: thoughts that are all good or all bad. “Always” thinking: thinking in words like always, never, no one, everyone, every time, everything.

For example, if a talented, attractive student tries out for the school play, but he believes that he is not very attractive or talented, he has little chance of getting the part. Many of our convictions about ourselves—whether we feel like a success or failure, whether we feel lucky or unlucky, whether the glass is half empty or half full—are simply just beliefs, and can all be changed.

A person with ADD often finds himself experiencing failure: failure to perform to his highest potential, failure to be able to sit still, failure to concentrate well, failure to organize well, failure to avoid distraction and addictive tendencies. This can lead to intense feelings of shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, and anger. Your attitudes about yourself or the things that people said to you in the past created an internal set of beliefs that hold you back. If you can recognize that these thoughts are just beliefs and that they belong to you, you can change them and convert them into positive beliefs that support you.

- CHANGING YOUR BELIEFS WITH SELF-HYPNOSIS The good news is that your brain and your mind belong to you. You have the right and the power to look at the beliefs, feelings, and behaviors that run your life, and to decide which you want to keep and which you want to change. One of the most powerful tools for doing this is the tool known as self-hypnosis. The techniques of self-hypnosis are widely used by psychologists and psychiatrists in clinical settings, and by peak performers such as athletes, musicians, actors, and public speakers, whose success depends upon their using their minds and brains at peak efficiency. Self-hypnosis is simply a tool, a powerful tool that can be used to dramatically change your beliefs and your life.

- The fundamental steps of self-hypnosis are: entering a state of deep relaxation positive affirmations visualizing success leaving the state of deep relaxation, and returning to a more usual, wakeful, state of consciousness STEP ONE: ENTERING THE DEEPLY RELAXED (SELF-HYPNOTIC) STATE To enter the state of deep relaxation, you will first learn how to use autosuggestion to separate yourself from all the fears, tensions, stresses, and confusions of the outside world for a few minutes. This is done by letting go of mental and physical tension, by focusing on the present moment, and allowing yourself to experience inner silence, stillness, and mental and physical relaxation. The technique we will use is counting to twenty, allowing the eyes to close, sending waves of relaxation throughout your body, then going to your own special place, your “haven.” The first few times you do this, you may not find yourself relaxing as deeply as the words seem to suggest. This is merely because you need practice. The world has trained most of us to be tense. After you have ([Location 5723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5723))

- done this a number of times, you will find it easier to quickly enter a deep state of relaxation. STEP TWO: POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS The second step is to hear positive self-talk. Most of us talk to ourselves each day, but much of what we say is negative, e.g., “I’m such a dolt,” “I’ll never be successful,” “Everybody else is doing better than I am.” The statements you will read to yourself on the tape (more on this later) will replace these negative statements with positive ones. These will then begin to create positive beliefs about yourself to replace the negative, harmful ones. Our goal is to create confidence where there was shyness, focus where there was disorganization, self-confidence where there was self-doubt, self-awareness where there was denial, self-acceptance where there was self-criticism, self-control and empowerment where there… ([Location 5732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5732))

- important skills. They are willfully suspending their disbelief and allowing themselves to pretend, to temporarily believe that they are actually parents or soldiers. Wise teachers know how to use imagination and pretend to teach valuable lessons. We will use imagination in a very similar way. If we asked you to close your eyes, and imagine sitting in your living room you would be able to point to the window, to the front door, and to reach over and pretend to flip on the light. In order to do this, you would be holding in your mind an image, a kind of mental model, then referring to it to give your responses to the questions. This is an example of mental imagery, or visualization. Even though we may use the word visualization, do not think it is absolutely necessary to “see” a clear “picture” in your mind. Fifty percent of adults and most children can “see” mental images in this way. It is helpful but not necessary for our purposes here. In the same way you can… ([Location 5741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5741))

As you go through this scene, you will imagine yourself actually being there, and carrying out the most successful behavior you can imagine. This will serve to be a kind of “post-hypnotic suggestion” to your deeper mind.

- when you were a young child. Most of the time you keep this part of you protected by your “ego,” allowing it to be openly available only when you know you are in a safe, secure situation. In the deeply relaxed state you have dropped your guard, so to speak, and when you return to your normal waking state it is best to do it gradually. In this way you will be able to reestablish the ego protections you need to be able to function smoothly as you go about your next activities. If you rouse yourself too quickly, you may feel a bit groggy, half asleep, or even a little anxious. If this should happen, simply sit or lie down and relax briefly, then bring yourself back into full activity more slowly.

Feel free to consult with your therapist, teacher, or other trusted advisor about which statements they might think it would be most valuable to include. But only include those that you feel very certain that you would like to believe. Do not use suggestions that hurt other people. Stay positive.

This may be a place you have been on vacation, a place you would like to visit someday, or even a completely imaginary place. If you find the imagery of the beach satisfactory, you may use the words written there. Many people find the tape to be more enjoyable and effective if music plays in the background. If you want music, set up a separate tape deck or CD player nearby, so you can control the volume from your chair. Locate a long piece of relatively slow music that you find relaxing. (Many people find that a tempo of about sixty beats per minute, the speed of the resting heart, is about right.) During the relaxation phase, play very slow music such as Bach’s “Air for the G String,” Pachelbel’s “Canon,” or slow New Age music. The only requirement is that the music be slow, gentle, relaxing, and appealing to you. You may play this throughout the entire tape, or, if you wish, you may… ([Location 5786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C1N97EO&location=5786))

It is better to use a separate microphone, rather than to use the one physically built into your recorder. Place the microphone in a holder about one to two feet in front of your mouth. INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING THE SCRIPT YOU PREPARE It is probably best to think of your first attempt to record as a practice session. This way you can listen to what you have done, closing your eyes and following the instructions to see if the speed, the volume of the music, and other aspects of your recording are just right. Play it back and make a note of changes you want to make in it. Speak the words clearly, directly toward the microphone. Speak slowly and clearly, enunciating each word carefully, but not so stiffly as to sound rigid. Try for a gentle, flowing sound, one that is soothing yet filled with confidence and enthusiasm.

- Most of the time it is a very good idea to personalize the tape by speaking the name of the person for whom you are making the tape several times throughout the tape. So you might begin with “Let yourself sit comfortably back in your chair, Johnny, and listen carefully. . . . ,” or “Now, Mary, picture yourself walking into your class feeling confident, and as you see your teacher, Mr. Wilson, you feel even better. . . .” Later you might say, “Each time you listen to this tape, Tommy, you will feel more and more confident in yourself.” If you are making this tape for a child, it is almost always a good idea to include the child’s name a number of times. If you are making a tape for yourself, you need to decide whether or not you will feel comfortable hearing your own voice say your name on several occasions. Turn on your tape recorder, wait about five seconds for the leader tape to pass, then immediately start the background music you’re going to play. Let about ten or fifteen seconds of music play on the tape before you begin to speak.

If you make a mistake, stop the tape recorder and the music. Rewind the tape recorder to the place where the error was made. (If you make sure to leave pauses every couple of sentences, there will always be an easy point for you to go back and edit.) Next, rewind the music approximately the same amount of time. It is not essential to start the music at the exact same passage you were in. The music will be very soft in the background, and the change will barely be noticed, if at all. Start the music, then start the tape recorder and continue reading from where you left off. If you need to pause at any point to read the instructions, you can do so: this is a lot to get through at a single reading. You may pause, and, just as you would do if you made a mistake, follow this procedure. After completing the recording, take a short break, have a glass of water, or take a little walk.

It’s important to remember that when you listen to your speaking voice, you have a stereophonic, high-fidelity connection augmented by the bass reflex subwoofer of your chest and the echo chamber of your sinuses. It’s never going to sound that good coming out of that little speaker. Everyone tends to react with disappointment when they hear the sound of their recorded voice. Just ignore any tendency toward self-criticism. When you listen to the tape, you will become rapidly so relaxed, you will forget the sound of the voice, and focus on the sound of the words. Change is going to occur within you; get used to listening to your own voice. (A parent’s voice is often soothing and acceptable to a child.

Feel the damp sand beneath your feet. White crests of waves slowly follow each other in toward the shore. And as you enjoy the deep, rich color of the ocean . . . perhaps you can feel the salty breeze blowing in, gently cool on the surface of your body.
