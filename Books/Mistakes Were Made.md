- MR. X: The trouble with Jews is that they only take care of their own group. MR. Y: But the record of the Community Chest campaign shows that they give more generously, in proportion to their numbers, to the general charities of the community, than do non-Jews. MR. X: That shows they are always trying to buy favor and intrude into Christian affairs. They think of nothing but money; that is why there are so many Jewish bankers. MR. Y: But a recent study shows that the percentage of Jews in the banking business is negligible, far smaller than the percentage of non-Jews. MR. X: That’s just it; they don’t go in for respectable business; they are only in the movie business or run night clubs.38 ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=1125))

- Allport nailed Mr. X’s thought processes perfectly. Mr. X doesn’t even try to respond to Mr. Y’s evidence; he just slides along to another reason for his dislike of Jews. Once people have a prejudice, just as once they have a political ideology, they do not easily drop it, even if the evidence indisputably contradicts a core justification for it. Rather, they come up with another justification to preserve their belief or rationalize a course of action. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=1134))

- forgive me, but that I was certainly aware that I was in need of their forgiveness.” At the end of the interview, Alix Spiegel said: “There are almost no people like Linda Ross, practicing therapists who have come forward to talk publicly about their experience, to admit culpability, or try to figure out how this happened. The experts, for once, are strangely silent.” ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=2271))

- The Pyramid of Choice, Once Again The guiding metaphor of this book has been the pyramid of choice: As soon as people make a decision, whether reasoned or impulsive, they will change their attitudes to conform to that choice and start minimizing or dismissing any information suggesting they chose the wrong option. Typically, in politics, people let their party identity make the decisions for them, which ([Location 4319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=4319))

- is why most voters feel little dissonance in supporting the candidate who heads their own party—“I’m a Republican [or Democrat]; that’s who I am and who I vote for.” But what happens when that candidate holds beliefs or behaves in ways that formerly would have been anathema to those voters?

- Most people who get caught in a lie, mistake, or hypocritical dance feel sharp dissonance and are motivated to squirm out of it with a flurry of self-justifications. ([Location 4340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=4340))

- But Trump has always been unfazed precisely because he feels no dissonance when caught. Feeling dissonance requires the ability to feel shame, guilt, empathy, and remorse, and he lacks that capacity. The only justifications he feels the need to make are claims that he can do anything he wants because he is “a very stable genius” and knows more than anyone about everything. He can never learn from his mistakes because he convinces himself that he never makes any—he cuts dissonance off at the pass, never allowing it into his brain. He is the quintessential con man, someone for whom lying is second nature. It’s just what you do. If the chumps believe you, that’s their problem.7 ([Location 4341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=4341))

- It is not coincidental that in 2016, the year that Donald Trump was elected, Oxford Dictionaries anointed as its word of the year post-truth, which it defined as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”—another tactic of the demagogue, and the Trump administration began implementing it immediately.

- Indeed, as dissonance theory predicts, the stronger and more persuasive the criticism, the stronger and more entrenched the need to ignore it. Trump’s critics “throw shit at him every day, all day long,” a sixty-nine-year-old real estate agent told a reporter, and then—unintentionally nailing the final step in reducing dissonance—she added: “It makes us want to support him more.”32 ([Location 4630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15IOE&location=4630))

- This has been a book about how difficult it is to own our mistakes and the crucial importance of doing so if we ever hope to learn and improve. Millions of citizens made a monumental mistake in electing, and then supporting, Donald Trump. Once he is gone from the scene, the self-forgiving distortions of memory will lead many of his former supporters to say, “I never voted for him anyway” or “I always had misgivings about him.” Many of his former opponents will breathe a sigh of relief and say, “Thank God that’s over.” But we can never be complacent again. We all need to stand back and ask: What have we learned? We have learned how precarious democracy is, how easily fear and anger can be invoked to manipulate a population. We have learned about the importance of voting, even if it means choosing a candidate we regard as the lesser of two evils rather than our number-one purely pristine perfect preference. We have learned that a democracy rests not only on its laws and institutions but also on its norms and values—and on the consensus of its citizenry that those norms and values are worth upholding. We have learned that heeding the rules of civility, decency, and diplomacy is a sign not of a nation’s weakness but of its strength.
