## Highlights
- It’s the oldest story ever told. The story of belief—of the basic, irresistible, universal human need to believe in something that gives life meaning, something that reaffirms our view of ourselves, the world, and our place in it. “Religion,” Voltaire is said to have remarked, “began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.” It certainly sounds like something he would have said. Voltaire was no fan of the religious establishment. But versions of the exact same words have been attributed to Mark Twain, to Carl Sagan, to Geoffrey Chaucer. It seems so accurate that someone, somewhere, sometime, must certainly have said it. And it seems so accurate, most of all, because it touches on a profound truth. The truth of our absolute and total need for belief from our earliest moments of consciousness, from an infant’s unwavering knowledge that she will be fed and comforted to an adult’s need to see some sort of justness and fairness in the surrounding world. In some ways, confidence artists like Demara have it easy. We’ve done most of the work for them; we want to believe in what they’re telling us. Their genius lies in figuring out what, precisely, it is we want, and how they can present themselves as the perfect vehicle for delivering on that desire.

- The confidence game—the con—is an exercise in soft skills. Trust, sympathy, persuasion. The true con artist doesn’t force us to do anything; he makes us complicit in our own undoing. He doesn’t steal. We give. He doesn’t have to threaten us. We supply the story ourselves. We believe because we want to, not because anyone made us. And so we offer up whatever they want—money, reputation, trust, fame, legitimacy, support—and we don’t realize what is happening until it is too late. Our need to believe, to embrace things that explain our world, is as pervasive as it is strong. Given the right cues, we’re willing to go along with just about anything and put our confidence in just about anyone. Conspiracy theories, supernatural phenomena, psychics: we have a seemingly bottomless capacity for credulity. Or, as one psychologist put it, “Gullibility may be deeply engrained in the human behavioral repertoire.” For our minds are built for stories. We crave them, and, when there aren’t ready ones available, we create them. Stories about our origins. Our purpose. The reasons the world is the way it is. Human beings don’t like to exist in a state of uncertainty or ambiguity. When something doesn’t make sense, we want to supply the missing link. When we don’t understand what or why or how something happened, we want to find the explanation. A confidence artist is only too happy to comply—and the well-crafted narrative is his absolute forte. There’s a likely apocryphal story about the French poet Jacques Prévert. One day he was walking past a blind man who held up a sign: “Blind man without a pension.” He stopped to chat. How was it going? Were people helpful? “Not great,” the man replied. “Some people give, but not a lot—and most just keep walking.” “Could I borrow your sign?” Prévert asked. The blind man nodded. The poet took the sign, flipped it over, and wrote a message. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=101))

- The next day, he again walked past the blind man. “How is it going now?” he asked. “Incredible,” the man replied. “I’ve never received so much money in my life.” On the sign, Prévert had written: “Spring is coming, but I won’t see it.” Give us a compelling story, and we open up. Skepticism gives way to belief. The same approach that makes a blind man’s cup overflow with donations can make us more receptive to most any persuasive message, for good or for ill. When we step into a magic show, we come in actively wanting to be fooled. We want deception to cover our eyes and make our world a tiny bit more fantastical, more awesome than it was before. And the magician, in many ways, uses the exact same approaches as the confidence man—only without the destruction of the con’s end game. “Magic is a kind of a conscious, willing con,” Michael Shermer, a science historian and writer who has devoted many decades to debunking claims about the supernatural and the pseudoscientific, told me one December afternoon. “You’re not being foolish to fall for it. If you don’t fall for it, the magician is doing something wrong.” ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=115))

- At their root, magic tricks and confidence games share the same fundamental principle: a manipulation of our beliefs.

- When Catch Me If You Can hero Frank Abagnale, who, as a teen, conned his way through most any organization you can imagine, from airlines to hospitals, was recently asked if his escapades could happen in the modern world—a world of technology and seemingly ever-growing sophistication—he laughed. Far, far simpler now, he said. “What I did fifty years ago as a teenage boy is four thousand times easier to do today because of technology. Technology breeds crime. It always has, and always will.” ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=163))

- Countless more cases go unreported—most cases, in fact, by some estimates. According to a recent study from the AARP, only 37 percent of victims older than fifty-five will admit to having fallen for a con; just over half of those under fifty-five do so. No one wants to admit to having been duped. Most con artists don’t ever come to trial: they simply aren’t brought to the authorities to begin with.

- No matter the medium or the guise, cons, at their core, are united by the same basic principles—principles that rest on the manipulation of belief. Cons go unreported—indeed, undetected—because none of us want to admit that our basic beliefs could be wrong. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=183))

- The confidence game starts with basic human psychology. From the artist’s perspective, it’s a question of identifying the victim (the put-up): who is he, what does he want, and how can I play on ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=190))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that desire to achieve what I want? It requires the creation of empathy and rapport (the play): an emotional foundation must be laid before any scheme is proposed, any game set in motion. Only then does it move to logic and persuasion (the rope): the scheme (the tale), the evidence and the way it will work to your benefit (the convincer), the show of actual profits. And like a fly caught in a spider’s web, the more we struggle, the less able to extricate ourselves we become (the breakdown). By the time things begin to look dicey, we tend to be so invested, emotionally and often physically, that we do most of the persuasion ourselves. We may even choose to up our involvement ourselves, even as things turn south (the send), so that by the time we’re completely fleeced (the touch), we don’t quite know what hit us. The con artist may not even need to convince us to stay quiet (the blow-off and fix); we are more likely than not to do so ourselves. We are, after all, the best deceivers of our own minds. At each step of the game, con artists draw from a seemingly endless toolbox of ways to manipulate our belief. And as we become more committed, with every step we give them more psychological ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=191))

- Robert Hare’s Psychopathy Checklist–Revised, the most common assessment tool for antisocial, psychopathic behavior, looks for things like responsibility, remorse, pathological lying, manipulativeness, cunning, promiscuity and general impulsiveness, superficial charm, grandiosity, and the like. Score high enough, and you are labeled psychopathic, or “suffering soul,” for the many such you leave in your wake. One of the defining marks of the psychopath is the inability to process emotion like other people. To a true psychopath, your suffering means nothing. There’s no empathy. There’s no remorse. There’s no guilt. When psychopaths experience something that would shock ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=323))

- Psychopaths, according to Hare, make up an estimated 1 percent of the male population; among women, they are almost nonexistent (though still present). That means that out of every hundred men you meet, one will be clinically diagnosable as a psychopath. But will he also be a born con man?

- And while some would doubtless argue that I’ve just made my own point—what are politicians, lawyers, businessmen, admen, and marketers but thinly veiled con artists?—the truth is that real con artists aren’t simply born. They are, as is usually the case, made as well. As the popular saying among scientists goes: genes load the gun; the environment pulls the trigger.

- Grifters are made when predisposition and opportunity meet. That’s one of the reasons, according to some sources, that insider trading—when businessmen turn con artist—flourished at Steven Cohen’s now infamous hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, for as long and as widely as it did. “You self-justify that it’s not so bad because everybody is trying to get an edge,” a source close to the fund explained over lunch one day. “And it’s less likely that I’m going to get caught because, clearly, somebody would’ve been caught by now.” At SAC, he continued, “There was no evidence that people ever stood up at the top of the firm and said in words that a third grader would understand, ‘By the way, don’t break the law. Don’t cheat, don’t steal—we don’t do that here.’” Take the indictment of the hedge fund itself. “One prospective employee was rumored to have engaged in insider trading at his prior place of employment. And he was hired. Over the objection of the compliance officer. And, shockingly, he started engaging in insider trading within a couple of weeks of joining.” ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=423))

- The grifter’s rationale for what he does, in a way, is the culmination of predisposition and opportunity: if you have the predisposing traits, and you sense a good opportunity, you will find a way to rationalize it.

- Would you be a grifter—even a mild one—if given the chance? Try this short test. Take your index finger, raise it to your forehead, and draw the letter Q. Done? Which way is your Q facing—tail to the right, or tail to the left? The test, described in detail by Richard Wiseman, a psychologist and famed skeptic, is a way to gauge your “self-monitoring” tendency. If you drew the letter with the tail to the left, so that others could read it, you are a high self-monitor. That means you are more concerned with appearance and perception—how others see you. To achieve the desired effect, you are likely more willing to manipulate reality—even just a bit—to make a better impression. Con artists, in some sense, merely take our regular white lies to the next level. Plagiarists. Fabulists. Confabulists. Impostors. They take that desire to shine, to be the best version of something, and they fly with it. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=538))

- With con artists, lie detection becomes even trickier. “A lie,” Ekman says, “is a deliberate choice to mislead a target without any notification.” Plus, the more you lie, the fewer identifying signs, even tiny ones, you display.

- wasn’t the people who saw the world most clearly who did best; it was, rather, those most skilled at the art of seeing the world as they wanted it to be. And the world-as-we-want-it-to-be is precisely what the con artist sells. The irony is inescapable. The same thing that can underlie success can also make you all the more vulnerable to the grifter’s wares. We are predisposed to trust. Those who trust more do better. And those who trust more become the ideal, albeit unwitting, player of the confidence game: the perfect mark. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=647))

- When it comes to predicting who will fall, personality generalities tend to go out the window. Instead, one of the factors that emerges is circumstance: it’s not who you are, but where you happen to be at this particular moment in your life. If you’re feeling isolated or lonely, it turns out you’re particularly vulnerable. Likewise if you’re going through a job loss, divorce, serious injury, or other major life change, are experiencing a downturn in personal finances, or are concerned with being in debt. People in debt, in fact, are also more likely to fall for fraud that’s completely unrelated to finances, like weight-loss products.

- Given the right fraud, it seems anyone can be a victim—even a con artist. There’s an entire subset of cons, in fact, devoted to catching the master grifter at his own game, often perpetrated by others who feel he might have gotten too big for his boots. Con artists tend to be supremely confident—how can anyone beat me at my own game?—and that confidence is often their undoing. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=745))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Con artists are often the best marks because they think themselves immune. And that false sense of immunity extends to victims more broadly: the better protected you are and the less likely you think you’ll be a victim, the more you’re apt to lose if a con artist can find a way to earn your trust. It ends up that the more you know about something, the more likely you are to fall for a con in that specific area.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So if anyone is a potential mark, how does the con artist choose the mark to begin with? How to pick out the best one for this particular game, the one most likely to fall quickly and profoundly? That’s what grifters are particularly good at: looking at a sea of faces and finding the one who, at this point in time, would be the perfect mark. It’s the first step of the confidence game, the put-up, and no one is better at it than Apollo Robbins, the so-called Gentleman Thief famed for his sleights of hand in even the tightest of circumstances. (Two career highlights: stealing the president’s top secret itinerary from a Secret Service man and removing the cartridge from a pen belonging to Penn of Penn and Teller fame.) As Robbins told me over dinner one evening, he never just steals willy-nilly. First, he cases. He observes. He profiles. Only then does he begin his act.

- For a con artist, however, accuracy is paramount, and feelings of self-worth, far less so: for him, self-worth is ingrained in his very ability to ferret out social nuance and personal vagaries better than anyone else. And there is one central factor that can override most shortcomings and make us far more accurate at figuring out who someone is and what makes her tick: motivation. People who are motivated to be accurate, whether financially or personally, suddenly become far more adept at reading faces, bodies, and minds alike. In one set of studies, people in powerful roles failed spectacularly at reading others. But when the researchers, Jennifer Overbeck and Bernadette Park, gave them a motivation for accuracy—make your subordinates feel engaged and included—they were suddenly far better at person-reading than they’d ever been. They were more accurate in judging employees’ personalities and abilities than their counterparts who’d been instructed to pay attention to efficiency and productivity. Con artists are motivated, always. They are us, as our best, most perceptive selves—who’ve also had years of practice.

- When we like someone or feel an affinity for them, we tend to mimic their behavior, facial expressions, and gestures, a phenomenon known as the chameleon effect. But the effect works the other way, too. If we mimic someone else, they will feel closer and more similar to us; we can fake the natural liking process quite well. We perpetuate minor cons every day, often without realizing it, and sometimes knowing what we do all too well, when we mirror back someone’s words or interests, feign a shared affinity for a sports team or a mutual hatred of a brand. The signs that usually serve us reliably can easily be massaged, especially in the short term—all a good con artist needs.

- As any good confidence man will tell you, someone who is emotional is someone who is vulnerable. And so, before a single element of the actual con is laid out, before a single persuasive appeal is made, before a mark knows that someone will want something, anything at all, from him, the emotional channels are opened. And as in that first rush of romantic infatuation, we abandon our reason to follow our feeling. Governing our reality are two systems, one emotional, one rational. And the two don’t follow the same rules. Or, as William James, the father of modern psychology, put it in his essay “Brute and Human Intellect,” in slightly more poetic fashion, “To say that all human thinking is essentially of two kinds—reasoning on the one hand, and narrative, descriptive, contemplative thinking on the other—is to say only what every reader’s experience will corroborate.” Whereas the rational concerns itself with the “right” choice, ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=1371))

- the proper impression, the correct course of action, emotions, says psychologist Seymour Epstein, cause us to think in “categorical, personal, concretive, unreflective, and action oriented” fashion.

- more confidence, in fact, than cognitive reasoning. The process wasn’t logical. Mere exposure, his studies had illustrated, often didn’t breed any sort of objective sense of familiarity or recognition. You didn’t remember that something had happened, that you’d seen something, heard something, felt something. Instead, it bred a simple, subjective liking. You didn’t know why, but you preferred this one thing. “Which do you prefer?” had become a question of “Which do I like more?” Our quick like-dislike judgments of something or someone, Zajonc found, happened all the time, in the absence of any conscious memory or cognitive effort. In lower animals, an affective reaction is often the only one. If you’re a rat, you have to respond fearfully to a snake long before you process what the snake is. Otherwise, you’ll be a very dead rat. Fundamentally, “Friend or foe?” is a more important survival question than almost anything else.

- Not only do we form emotional impressions long before we create any rational understanding, but those impressions, in turn, are “irrevocable.” “We can readily accept that we can be wrong,” Zajonc told his audience that September afternoon. “But we are never wrong about what we like or dislike.” Or, in a con artist’s interpretation, most any cries of foul play will fall on deaf ears if you’ve already decided you like the person doing the conning. They “feel” more right. We trust our feelings more than anything anyone can tell us to the contrary. Our preferences need no inferences—and activating those preferences is what the play is all about.

- Stories bring us together. We can talk about them and bond over them (both liking them and hating them). They are shared knowledge, shared legend, shared history, and, in a sense, shared future. Stories are meant to entertain and educate, to pass the time and record it. They are so natural that we don’t notice how much they permeate our lives. And we pay little attention when yet another one catches our eye or ear. After all, stories are on our side. No matter the format, they are an ever-present form of entertainment. That’s precisely why they are such a powerful tool of deception, and so vital when it comes to the play. When we’re immersed in a story, we let down our guard.

- The Marc Antony gambit, taken from Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra, is a particular favorite of con men. “I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him,” Marc Antony says in his first speech to the Roman people. His listeners hated Caesar; that note sets them on the same page and ensures their attention—and their loyalty, since they are primed to think they will agree with what follows, given their wholehearted endorsement of the opening line. Of course, Antony then goes on to praise Caesar. And he gets away with it. No one quite realizes what’s going on. “I’m not trying to sell you anything!” “You can take it or leave it!” “I’m not looking for charity!” So many prefaces to a story can catch you off guard Marc Antony–style. No self-respecting con artist goes straight for the kill. It’s a relationship built on trust, and a story that evolves over time.

Emotion is the key to empathy. Arouse us emotionally and we will identify with you and your plight all the more. Keep us cold, and your goal is far away. “Our results,” Zak told psychologist Jeremy Dean, “show why puppies and babies are in toilet paper commercials. This research suggests that advertisers use images that cause our brains to release oxytocin to build trust in a product or brand, and hence increase sales.” Increased oxytocin makes us more generous—with our money, our time, our trust, ourselves.

- Why is the emotional approach so successful when it comes to the play? Simply put, because emotions cause us to act in a way that nothing else quite does—and action is just what the confidence artist wants. That is the con’s entire endpoint. When our emotions are awakened, we tend to rely on them more than on anything else. In the 1970s and 1980s, psychologists Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore ran a series of studies that looked at whether people’s emotions colored how they processed information and made subsequent decisions. What they found, time and time again, was that when we’re asked to make a judgment, we usually ask ourselves, “How do I feel about it?” When the answer is negative, we see it as evidence of something being wrong.

- In one sense, it matters little what we’re actually feeling: any emotional arousal will cloud our judgment to some extent. It makes us unthinking and it makes us malleable. It’s perfectly understandable why it’s the favored approach of many a police interrogator and lawyer, not just con artists. Arousal can compel us to act against our long-term interest—because, in the immediate term, we suddenly can’t quite tell the difference. The most primitive parts of our brain take over the rational. In one study, arousal alone was enough to get someone to agree with a request for help; it little mattered what the content of the request might happen to be. What visceral states do is create an intense attentional focus. We tune out everything else and tune in to the in-the-moment emotional cues. It’s similar to the feeling of overwhelming hunger or thirst—or the need to go to the bathroom—when you suddenly find yourself unable to think about anything else.

- In 2003, Eric Knowles, a social psychologist at the University of Arkansas who has been researching persuasion since the 1970s, and Jay Linn, an organizational and social psychologist at Widener University, posited that all persuasive strategies could be categorized into two types. The first, alpha, was far more frequent: increasing the appeal of something. The second, omega, decreased resistance surrounding something. In the one, you do what you can to make your proposition, whatever it may be, more attractive. You rev up the backstory—why this is such a wonderful opportunity, why you are the perfect person to do it, how much everyone will gain, and the like. In the other, you make a request or offer seem so easy as to be a no-brainer—why wouldn’t I do this? What do I have to lose? They called the juxtaposition the approach-avoidance model of persuasion: you can convince me of something by making me want to approach it and decreasing any reasons I might have to avoid it. The rope, then, is the alpha and ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=1986))

- The psychologist Robert Cialdini, one of the leading experts on persuasion, argues that six principles govern most persuasive relationships: reciprocity (I rub your back, you rub mine), consistency (I believe the same thing today as I did yesterday), social validation (doing this will make me belong), friendship or liking (exactly what it sounds like), scarcity (quick! there isn’t much to go around), and authority (you seem like you know what you’re talking about).

Otherwise, I wouldn’t have invested my time and resources in you.

- But niceness isn’t the only way to go. Another effective technique that Cialdini first identified in 1975 is the door-in-the-face, a near opposite of the foot-in-the-door. When someone we don’t really know asks us for a large favor—or even someone we do know catches us on an off day—and we (understandably) refuse, we do indeed feel rude, just as Bem would have predicted. But we don’t like feeling rude. And so we also feel something else we don’t like: guilty. So what happens when the person we turned down asks us for something else, something smaller, something that seems far more reasonable in comparison? We say yes. Guilt assuaged—and con artist’s mission accomplished. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=2084))

- In 1986, Santa Clara University psychologist Jerry Burger proposed a persuasion—or roping, if you will—tactic that relied not on a comparison between two separate favors but on a comparison within the favor itself: the that’s-not-all technique. An effective approach, Burger found, is to start with a false baseline (that is, not at all what you’re planning to eventually propose) and then, in quick succession, make changes and additions to that starting point that make it seem increasingly attractive. You make an initial bid—how would you like to get in on this land deal in Florida?—and before your mark can respond, you turn it into something else. “That’s not all. You also get a guaranteed return on your initial investment.” ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=2134))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- People who were approached with a that’s-not-all story, Burger found, were more likely to buy into it than those who heard the great offer right away. (The that’s-not-all-ing, incidentally, can continue for a while. You need not stop at one.) That’s-not-all is actually a member of a broader set of persuasive tactics, known as disrupt-then-reframe techniques. First you disrupt someone’s understanding of an attempt to influence her, and then you reframe the attempt in a way that makes her more vulnerable to it. Here’s how it works. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert proposes that we understand the world in two stages. First we take it at face value, in order to decipher the sense of what someone is telling us. And then we evaluate it, in order to judge the soundness of what we’ve just deciphered. Disrupt-then-reframe attacks the evaluative part of the process: we don’t have a chance to give a proper assessment because each time we try to do so, the situation changes.

- In 1984, psychologist Joel Brockner pioneered a new approach, one of the street hustler’s favorites: the even-a-penny-would-help. Similar to the foot-in-the-door, here, asking for a little helps you get a lot. But it’s not quite the same thing. You’re not looking to make two different-size requests. Instead, you’re looking to exploit something known as the “legitimization effect.” A request for a tiny amount of money legitimizes you in the eyes of others. If you were a swindler, you’d ask for a lot, wouldn’t you? If you’d be happy with only a penny, what kind of a thief are you? It works the same way for organizations. If you’re looking for a tiny donation—a dollar or another inconsequential-seeming amount—you look like you’re working hard for very little. You’re not the type of person to go all tricksy on me.

- French and Bertram Raven posited that there were five major bases from which power derives: reward power, or the belief that someone is able to reward you; coercive power, or the belief that someone is able to punish you somehow; legitimate power, or an actual basis of authority; referent power, or power derived from your affiliation with someone (or desire to be affiliated with them); and expert power, from someone’s expertise on a topic. Con artists are after power: power over you and your future actions. So how do they derive it? From which base does it stem in order for the rope to work its persuasive magic? The grifter will avoid coercion at all costs. That would be unaristocratic. Not to mention unartistic. Con artists don’t demand, they don’t threaten, they don’t intimidate. Instead, they use the softer touch: some reward power with a little authority and affiliation mixed in. In one review of the literature on fraud victims, marks said they often thought that not only was the person doing the conning legitimate, but the reward he was offering was the real deal as well.

- dealing with someone to be reckoned with (legitimate power), and that someone is in a position to reward you, be it financially or otherwise (reward power). Indeed, in establishing their legitimacy, the victims said, their scammers appealed often and early to trust and authority. The logic is clear. If you know someone is asking for something, you need to know early on who that someone is and why, exactly, you should listen. We get authority in two ways: by virtue of what we know (authority based on expertise) or by virtue of who we are (authority based on position). The confidence artist will exploit both. But the second is much easier to fake than the first; indeed, the first, or at least the perception of it, often follows in its wake.

- Our desire to be accepted as a member of groups that appeal to us is, according to Cialdini, one of the strongest motivators in our being persuaded by something: it is an important reason that the rope often works effectively. We are more likely to go along with something if it has the stamp of approval of a group we trust or promises us entry in a group we’d like to belong to. Even when we’re anonymous and the group not particularly desirable, we’d still like to be included more than not—and it hurts when we are excluded. Kipling Williams, a Purdue University social psychologist whose work centers on ostracism, found that, in a virtual ball toss game, people who were passed over by the other group members felt worse about themselves and had a greater need for belonging—a psychological concept that measures the general extent to which we want to be part of a larger group.

Power, in other words, can come from the construction of the argument rather than its substance: power through how you phrase something rather than what you’re actually saying. A good confidence artist uses the structure of his pitch to manipulate the way we perceive or think about something. He may not be powerful as such—perhaps he’s just a nice guy you met in the lobby—but he has power to influence your reality, the way you understand and parse an argument or proposition. If he’s a good roper, you will soon be seeing the world as he sees it, and not as you did moments before falling under his sway.

- In the choice of food, effects like these may seem minor. But the order effect—what Russo was demonstrating—is but one of the many elements of decision architecture—how information is presented to us—that can get us to make decisions in a very precise way, and not necessarily in a way that corresponds to our stated preferences. There’s the positive side of decision architecture, the nudge, popularized by behavioral economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein in their 2008 book by the same name. The idea behind the nudge, in its positive guise, is a simple one. In many cases, our choices aren’t based on some innate preference. Instead, they are constructed at any given moment by a combination of situational factors. I may not have thought about drinking wine with dinner, for instance, but if the wine list is right in front of me, I may find myself ordering a glass all the same. The psychology of why nudges work forms the entire basis of a confidence artist’s soft power. Just ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=2407))

That is, you influence a decision by changing how, precisely, that decision is presented. Thaler and Sunstein explain their reasoning in terms of a seeming oxymoron: libertarian paternalism. The environment affects our choices no matter what, the argument goes, so why not make sure it’s doing so for the better? Or, in the case of the con artist, for the worse?

There is no better mark, many a con artist will tell you, than one who has already been duped. When Bluma Zeigarnik, a psychologist from the Gestalt school, discovered her eponymous effect—we remember interrupted tasks better than completed ones; our minds haven’t quite given up working on them, and we feel a strong need to attain some sort of closure—she also noted a far less frequently cited exception. As it turns out, we don’t remember all uninterrupted tasks equally. Zeigarnik found that for some people the effect was reversed. If a person felt she had performed poorly, the task was promptly dismissed from the mind.

In 1943, Saul Rosenzweig, a psychologist at Clark University and Worcester State Hospital, further elaborated on Zeigarnik’s exception.

- failure in light of success. Well, we can fathom it. We just don’t really think it’s going to happen—not yet, not now, not to us. Our optimism in the future runs ever-strong. So strong, in fact, that we often create the illusion of successful outcomes ourselves, even without the sorts of cash incentives a Miller or a Law or a Madoff offers. We see a con going well, and read our desires into ambiguous signs, to convince ourselves that we’ve invested wisely, be it money, time, reputation, or any other precious resources. When we want to, we see signs of good fortune everywhere. It’s one of the reasons for the famous hot-hand fallacy that Cornell University psychologist Thomas Gilovich identified in 1985. Gilovich had first observed the phenomenon among basketball aficionados when they pronounced players on a “hot streak” or playing with a “hot hand.” The players and coaches, too, seemed to believe it—even going so far as to select certain draft picks because they were perceived to be playing hot at the time. To Gilovich, the whole thing seemed highly unlikely.

- and there was simply no reason to assume that people’s talent and skills could show such tremendous, lasting deviations. He’d also been working with Amos Tversky, who, along with Daniel Kahneman, had identified the “belief in the law of small numbers” some ten years prior: that we believe that chance rates seen over the long term should also be reflected in the short term, and if they are not, something else must be going on. For instance, since a coin is supposed to land on heads half the time, we expect it to do so if we toss it, say, ten times. We don’t take into consideration the fact that averages are derived over a broader timescale. And so, if we see tails coming up time and time again, we tend to think that we’re particularly lucky.

They failed to find any relationship suggestive of actual hot hands: a player who made one shot was no more likely to make another soon after. Any deviations from their average level of play were the result not of streaks, but of chance: they were to be expected from the probability distributions and were not the result of some magical power that a player suddenly had.

- fallacy has been largely disproven—in 2006, a review of twenty years of data found an overwhelming lack of evidence for the presence of sudden bouts of talent—it continues to govern our thoughts of the future. If a player is on a hot streak, we should give him the proverbial ball because he will make the shot. In hedge funds, Kahneman points out, we see the same thing. When a fund has been tremendously successful for a few years, investors pour in: success now, even in something as volatile and chance-like as markets, means success always. Often, though, those phenomenal returns evaporate or reverse. It is, after all, a game of chance. Sure, a manager could be quite good, but ultimately he also has to be quite lucky—and luck can often masquerade as talent when the latter is absent. Not only do we get fooled into thinking that just because something is working now, the future will be even better, but we often project our desires onto our estimations of likely success. In other words, we tend to think that what will happen is what we want to happen, especially if the outcome is an important one.

In one, they would have to print a set of words as quickly as possible; in another, pitch rings onto a stick (a game called quoits); and in a third, manipulate a series of shapes in their heads under time pressure. Each time a participant finished a particular task, Frank would let her know how she’d performed—and would ask her how well she wanted to do on the next go-around. The better she wanted to perform, he found, the better she’d estimate she would, in fact, perform in the future, even when that performance was in no way warranted by her past experience.

- Unrealistic optimism about the future doesn’t just make us think everything will continue to go well if we’re seeing returns at this very moment. It also makes us complacent—and complacently overconfident—even when we have the chance to get out. It’s like Miller’s investors, who came to withdraw and ended up depositing. The logic is actually quite clear. You are wavering—maybe things aren’t that great—but then you see just a hint of reassurance: Miller’s plants, who asked for refunds and then promptly redeposited the cash. (A vaunted strategy of the con artist: work with a gang, and make sure plenty of those who look just like the marks are actually nicely paid to string those marks along.) And you start the age-old game: What will I regret more? Knowing I’m safe, and having missed out on a potentially great investment, or risking it, and knowing that if the fantastic returns continue, I will grow rich along with them? Anticipated emotion—that is, the emotion we can anticipate feeling if we take a certain course of action—strongly favors the status quo. Anticipated regret makes us want to keep doing what we’re doing; anticipated stress makes us want to cope proactively, by not doing anything that might provoke said stress; and anticipated guilt makes us likewise want to prevent it from ever happening.

When we experience an event that counteracts a prior belief, he argued, the resulting tension is too much for us to handle; we can’t hold two opposing beliefs at the same time, at least not consciously. “The individual strives,” Festinger wrote in A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, “toward consistency within himself.” True, here and there one might find exceptions. But overall, “It is still overwhelmingly true that related opinions or attitudes are consistent with one another. Study after study reports such consistency among one person’s political attitudes, social attitudes, and many others.” He continued, “There is the same kind of consistency between what a person knows or believes and what he does.” If we believe in education, we send our children to college. If a child knows something is bad but can’t quite resist it, she’ll try to avoid getting caught if she does it. So when something goes awry—someone knows smoking is bad for him but smokes anyway, for instance—we work to reduce the tension, through a process Festinger called dissonance reduction. Festinger first observed the tendency not in a lab, but rather in the actions of a cult he had been following, which believed that an alien-led rapture would, on a certain date, at a certain time, lead the members to the alien world as a reward for their goodliness. When the date and time came and went, though, and no aliens were forthcoming, Festinger expected the cult would disperse. Instead, the group promptly reformulated their understanding of the alien plan. While Festinger… ([Location 3505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=3505))

- wrote, “wherein men, having a delight in such vanities, mark the events where they are fulfilled, but where they fail, although this happened much oftener, neglect and pass them by.” In other words, they work to minimize the discord in their minds—the exact tendency Festinger would term dissonance reduction. To reduce dissonance, Festinger argued, we can do several things. We can revise our interpretation of the present reality: there actually isn’t any inconsistency; we were just looking at it wrong. We achieve this through selectively looking for new, confirming information or selectively ignoring disconfirming information. The study on smoking was flawed. The sample was biased. It doesn’t apply to me. We can revise our prior expectation: I thought this would happen all along, so it’s actually not discordant. I always knew they would try to convince me smoking was bad, so learning that fact isn’t actually jarring. I was prepared all along and made the decision anyhow: I think my experience… ([Location 3520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=3520))

- smoking than to actually quit. Even as conflicting evidence comes in, expectancies tend to be sticky, especially when they’ve been confirmed in the past. “Once useful expectancies have developed,” write psychologists Neal Roese and Jeffrey Sherman, “our cognitive system is rather conservative about altering or replacing them.” We don’t altogether ignore new inputs—that would be maladaptive and stupid—but we err on the side of what we’ve already decided was true. After all, we did a lot of work to get to that point. And what we’ve already decided was true can color how we view the new event: even as a conflicting piece of information is coming to our attention, we are already revising our interpretation of it to fit with our expectancy. Our prior expectations act as a heuristic of sorts: they give us a basic cognitive road map for how we should look at what’s going on, so that with every new piece of information we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.… ([Location 3529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=3529))

Our desire to avoid dissonance in the first place has an in-the-moment impact on how we evaluate what’s happening—and what we choose to evaluate or ignore in the first place.

- In 1796, the Marquis de Laplace observed in his Essai philosophique sur les probabilités that “it is principally at games of chance that a multitude of illusions support hope and sustain it against unfavorable chances.” This became the first known formulation of a bias that in more recent years has become one of the most widely studied tendencies in cognitive psychology: the gambler’s fallacy. The name comes from that temple of chance, the casino. A gambler has just lost a hand. Now another. And another. Why does he keep playing? Why doesn’t he just cut his losses and walk away while he’s not too far behind? We tend to believe that chance has a way of evening things out. If a coin has landed on tails eight times, the next one must be heads. It’s hard for us to wrap our heads around the fact that probability doesn’t care about timing, doesn’t care about what we think, and doesn’t care about what came before. Each event is entirely independent of the one before, and will in no way affect the one after. Still, the gambler insists that the next one will be the lucky winner. It’s been a long time coming, but it’s right around the corner, in the next toss of the die, turn of the wheel, flip of the card.

- Norfleet had just lost $20,000. But with just one more investment, one more play, he could make it all back, and then some. And so, like all gamblers, even the most rational-seeming ones, he took the plunge. A loss, a good confidence artist knows, doesn’t spell the end: that’s why the breakdown sucks the mark in further rather than letting him off the hook. Under the right circumstances, a loss can signal a deepening of commitment. There’s evidence that if we experience a particularly painful situation—the loss of a lot of money, for example—and then successfully overcome it, or think we’ve done so, say, by deciding to give more money, we feel a great sense of accomplishment—and, a bit perversely, a greater sense of loyalty to the cause of our pain.

- Unfortunately for us, the worse the losses get, the more we are likely to stumble. Positive illusions, psychologist Shelley Taylor notes, are often defensive mechanisms to a threatening circumstance. Even if we don’t realize our worldview is under fire, we already start overcompensating to protect it. We don’t yet understand we’re being conned, but already, we are buying into the game all the more, to try to protect our certainty that everything will turn out for the best.

- The Teton Dam seems far removed from the world of the confidence game, except for one key similarity: once we’ve invested heavily in something, we no longer see it clearly, no matter the costs. Things that are red flags in retrospect are dismissed as irrelevant once we’ve already sunk sufficient resources—money, time, reputation—into an endeavor. It doesn’t matter if we’re dealing with artwork or something as serious as losing human lives, taking away people’s livelihoods, creating billions in damage, and setting back the environment of an entire region by decades.

- the warnings? The fact that they don’t see or know, of course, is the reason that the send and touch are able to unfold as they are: we are so invested that we become blind, and so we raise our commitment right until the moment when the whole thing comes crashing down, be it literally (the dam) or metaphorically (an art gallery). To victims of the Teton Dam disaster just as to victims of the Rosales art fraud, it seems obvious that people should have known. Look at the IFAR report, the Dedalus report, the shady Mr. X. You’d have to be daft not to realize you were dealing with fakes. Look at the geological reports, the warning letters. Construction should have been ended. Ann Freedman should have realized, if not immediately, then at least once the paintings just kept coming, that something wasn’t right. Because the flags. They are there. They are waving. And people aren’t blind, right? Except they absolutely are. And the more they have invested, the blinder they become. In the early 1980s, Paul Slovic and Richard Thaler were discussing the crazy things people do as they make decisions to buy and sell, invest and divest, in ways that seem completely illogical to ([Location 3949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=3949))

- Thaler termed the phenomenon the sunk-cost fallacy. The sunk-cost effect gives us a continued, strong motivation to believe in something even when the landscape has changed significantly since we first invested ourselves in it. In theory, we should only care about new, incremental costs. What we’ve already put into something shouldn’t matter: it’s lost anyway, whatever “it” happens to be—time, money, energy, whatever else. We should stick with it only if it still seems worthwhile in light of new evidence. We should abandon a dam if we see signs that the available data have changed since we authorized it. The money has already been spent, true. But if the signs are accurate, we are heading for disaster. Why throw good money after bad? We should abandon a partnership with a collector if we see signs that he’s not what we first thought him to be. The paintings have already been sold, true. But if the signs are accurate, we are headed for an even greater hit to our reputation. Why not admit you were wrong, and emerge ahead of the inevitable scandal? Alas, that is not at all how our minds work. The more and the longer we’ve invested in something, the more likely the sunk-cost argument is to get the better of both our reason and our perception. We don’t ignore red flags. To us, they simply aren’t there.

In a famous study on inattentional blindness, Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris found that a majority of people fail to perceive a gorilla pounding her chest in the middle of a basketball game when they’ve been instructed to count the number of basketball passes between certain players. So busy are they with their task that they fail to see something much more glaring. The exact same thing happens by the time we get to the send and the touch: when we should be running away, we don’t even see the danger, committing ourselves further and further until we have nothing left. To a disinterested observer, with nothing invested and no preconceived notions, the gorilla is there, plain as day. To someone invested in a specific task or engrossed in the drama of the confidence game, it is essentially invisible.

- would seem to be an aversive event,” they wrote. “The admission can be avoided by continuing to act as if the prior spending was sensible, and a good way to foster that belief would be to invest more.” Indeed, in an unrelated study, Northwestern psychologist Barry Staw found that even telling someone flat out that an investment decision was bad wasn’t enough to get them to reverse it. Business school students who felt responsible for a bad investment continued to put money into it—significantly more than in any other option. The thing is, just as with most fallacies, the psychology of sunk costs—continuing to wait it out despite a stream of losses—isn’t always irrational. In the entrapment effect, people undergo steady, small losses as they await an eventual goal—like commuters who’ve already spent an hour waiting for the bus and remain reluctant to call a cab because the bus might still come. And indeed, at times, come it does. We are willing to take on increasingly greater risk for a reward that is potentially even greater.

- Not only do we become blinded to risks, but the past starts to look infinitely better in retrospect. Writing in the Harvard Law Review in 1897, future Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, “It is in the nature of a man’s mind. A thing which you enjoyed and used as your own for a long time, whether property or opinion, takes root in your being and cannot be torn away without your resenting the act and trying to defend yourself, however you came by it. The law can ask no better justification than the deepest instincts of man.” In psychology, that idea is called the endowment effect, first articulated by Thaler in 1980. By virtue of being ours, our actions, thoughts, possessions, and beliefs acquire a glow they didn’t have before we committed to them. Sunk costs make us loath to spot problems and reluctant to swerve from a committed path. And the endowment effect imbues the status quo—what we’ve done—with an overly optimistic and rosy glow. It makes us want to hold on to it all the more. ([Location 4018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=4018))

- The status quo bias only makes things worse. We like things as they are. Children already know the toy they have is fun. Why risk exchanging it only to find the new one isn’t as good? The new path is uncertain. The one we’re on, we’ve already charted out and experienced. Just ask the executives who came up with New Coke. They’ll tell you how deeply we cling to the status quo. From toys to elections (the incumbent effect) to jobs and relationships that coast along on inertia, the status quo is supremely attractive. As Samuel Johnson once said, “To do nothing is within the power of all men.” Once we’re in the home stretch of the confidence game, our investment renders us unable to be objective about the past evidence; we ignore the breakdown and open the way for the send because we refuse to admit we could have been wrong. We persist in acting as we did before, despite the growing evidence that we should change course. And so of course the con is successful: the touch goes off without a hitch, and we’re left completely fleeced.

That’s the exact kind of reasoning that makes us so susceptible to the send: we give more and more to justify our “objectivity.” And by the time we realize something is off, if we ever do, the touch has already gone off and the meat of the confidence game is done. Once we’re in the game, it’s easiest to follow the path of least resistance. It justifies what we’ve already done and reduces the effort we need to make going forward. The deeper we get, the more difficult psychologically it becomes to extricate ourselves, or to see that we’re even in need of extrication. All of the factors are aligned against us.

- Likewise in investment behavior: if we pick a stock and it goes up, we think we’re the cause; if it goes down, stupid markets. And the deeper we’re enmeshed in something, be it a confidence scheme or a more benign sort of game, the stronger the illusion grows. In one of her subsequent studies, Langer found that the more information individuals had about a pure chance lottery, the more confident they were in their ability to win—to the point that they actively refused a chance to trade their original ticket for one where the objective chances of winning were better. What’s more, when participants were given time to familiarize themselves with and practice on a task of pure luck, they rated their confidence in their ability to succeed in that task significantly higher—even though the chance nature of the task had not changed in any way. They further thought they had more control if, in a dice game, they, and not someone else, were the ones doing the throwing. Here’s the most pernicious part: when you try to be reflective, you only tend to polarize your existing beliefs. Langer found that initial optimism grew only stronger with some “rational” thought.

- Our reputation is the most important thing we have. It determines not only how we’re seen by others, but also how they will act toward us. Will they trust us? Will they want to do business with us? Do they consider us responsible, reliable, likable, effective? In medieval Europe, fama meant two things: what people said about others’ behaviors, and reputation. The fact that both ideas were represented in a single word signals a fundamental truth: our reputation, in effect, is what others say it is. Financial ruin is often the least part of the confidence game; in fact, many con artists aren’t even after money. The deepest scars come to our reputations—to how we’re seen by others and how that perception will, in turn, affect our future. That is precisely what the confidence artist is counting on, even after, despite our best efforts at self-delusion, it becomes apparent that we’ve been taken for a ride: that our reputational motivation will be strong enough to keep us quiet.

- he’s after, and is ready to disappear from our lives. But how to do that without getting caught, so that he can easily go on to play the same game he’s just played with some new mark? In the blow-off, the confidence artist has one main goal: now that the touch has been taken, get the mark out of the way as quickly as possible. The last thing you want is for someone to complain and thus draw attention to the whole enterprise. The blow-off is often the final step of the con, the grifter’s smooth disappearance after the game has played out. Sometimes, though, the mark may not be so complacent. If that happens, there’s always one more step that can be taken: the fix, when a grifter puts off the involvement of law enforcement to prevent marks from making their complaints official.

- ourselves displaced in the relative food chain. We lie. We cheat. We steal. We quarrel. We betray. We backstab, literally and figuratively. As Thomas Hobbes put it best, life in its natural state would be nasty, brutish, and short. And so we must have ways of keeping one another in check to keep our social groups functional enough to successfully avoid predators and stay alive. In the nonhuman primates, the task of group maintenance falls on a behavior known as grooming, a process in which monkeys physically touch, pet, and nitpick (in the best possible way) to signal to one another that they are invested in the relationships they have. Grooming is one of the most effective methods of bonding. The physical touch itself releases endorphins, and endorphins flood us with feelings of pleasure, warmth, and well-being. The time we invest in that touch signals that we have nothing more important to do than spend time maintaining our relationship. The more primates groom, in fact, the larger their possible social group. Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist at Oxford whose work for over four decades has centered on social bonding in primates, has found that grooming time along with the size of the neocortex (the part of our brain dedicated to higher-order functions) is a perfect proxy for how large our social groups can get. That neocortical size, in turn, signals something very specific. The largest nonhuman social group tops out at about eighty connections. In humans, however, close connections have taken a qualitative jump, to almost double that, coming in at an average of 150—Dunbar’s eponymous number. Presumably, such a leap in social group size would also signal a leap in grooming time. Our fellow catarrhines spend about a fifth of their waking hours engaged in grooming. Humans would theoretically need to spend proportionally more to get to their larger group size. But, Dunbar found, that doesn’t happen. Instead, we spend roughly the same fifth engaged exclusively in grooming-like actions. So what changes? In simple terms, language. We don’t have to rely on grooming alone to maintain strong social bonds and forge large functional groups capable of withstanding the stresses of life. We have words. And just as grooming signals investment and trust, creating a sense of mutual obligation between groomer and groomee, so, too, can our… ([Location 4229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=4229))

They focused specifically on those conversations that seemed to be between friends and that appeared relaxed and informal. Every thirty seconds, the eavesdropper would note the general topic of conversation, condensed into broad categories such as “technical/instructional” (someone explaining how, say, the election process functioned or a car engine works), “work/academic” (complaining about a class or pesky meeting), “sport/leisure” (that lousy Knicks game . . .), and so on.

As they made their bids, they could see what everyone else was doing as well—but not who those people actually were. One market promised a constant return no matter what.

- and there’s nothing left for anyone.) If everyone invests in the second market, the group will reach its maximum payout and each person will go home richer. But if some people opt for the sure-thing steady payoff, that return ends up being higher than that of the no longer optimal second market. Ostrom found that, left completely to their own devices, people weren’t all too certain of the anonymous others in the group. And so, many of them flocked to the first, steady market. As a result, everyone ended up making, on average, only one fifth of what they could have made had everyone joined market two. In other words, there were enough lone wolves who chose to bank on their own returns instead of trusting others that those who did trust in the collective good ended up doing worse. But then Ostrom changed the rules.

The famous prisoner’s dilemma offers a useful example here: in this dilemma, if both prisoners cooperate—that is, stay quiet—they both get off; but if one defects and talks while the other doesn’t, the one who stayed quiet gets the roughest end of the deal. One way to solve the problem would be to allow for communication—but the very essence of the dilemma is that communication is not permitted. If you could agree not to tell on each other, you’d both get off. But you don’t have that chance. What to do?

- In 2005, psychologists Deborah Small, George Loewenstein, and Paul Slovic set out to determine whether they could break down the identifiable-victim effect through sheer force of logic. In a series of four field studies, they systematically explained to people what went on in their heads when they saw a single victim as opposed to a so-called statistical victim. Then they measured how much money each person gave to a charity or an individual. The results weren’t quite what they had expected. People did indeed start giving less to individual victims—but they didn’t re-channel ([Location 4446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=4446))

- channel their generosity to greater statistical causes. Instead, they were simply less generous overall. It didn’t matter how the effect was framed: that people typically give more to individuals or less to statistical victims. And if the statistics were shown along with the victim—this is Annique, and she suffers from malaria, just like 67 percent of the population, or about 61.4 million people—the donations likewise fell. One of the reasons Rosales was so successful for so long is that she cared nary a moment about the reputations she was savaging. One of the reasons Hartzell persisted for decades was that he conned tens of thousands—a sea, not individuals. It’s easy to rationalize away conning someone—they were complicit, too. A truly honest mark, the saying goes, would never be conned. Of course, that’s far from the truth, but the rationalization goes a long way. It allows the grifter to play the game to the end, disappearing into the night in a well-played blow-off, or after a well-timed fix, if it comes to that. And it allows him to keep the game going over and over, following each successful ending with a fresh beginning. But we are not statistics to ourselves. And our view of the world is so egocentric, so intimately tied to the notion that we are just as important to everyone else as we are to ourselves, that we cannot fathom that everybody isn’t caring nearly as much about our story as we ourselves do. So we cling to our reputation. We think everyone pays attention to the slightest thing we do, the slightest thing we say, the slightest deviation in our demeanor. And so, to the end, our concern for our reputation allows the confidence game to continue, over and over and over: the blow-off and the fix reach their intended end. We stay quiet. And the wheel turns again. The same players. The same victims. The same tricks. All sustained by our need to believe, not only in the best version of the world, but in the best version of ourselves.

- And the reason it happens—and often happens to the most intelligent of people (note, Sullivan would say, the typical cult recruit: young, smart, sophisticated, savvy)—is that human nature is wired toward creating meaning out of meaninglessness, embracing belief over doubt. “There are certain essential things we all have in common,” Sullivan said. “There’s a deep desire for faith, there’s a deep desire to feel there’s someone up there who really cares about what’s going on and intervenes in our life. There’s a desire to have a coherent worldview: there’s a rhyme and reason for everything we do, and all the terrible things that happen to people—people die, children get leukemia—there’s some reason for it. And here’s this guru who says, ‘I know exactly the reason.’” It’s the reason behind all cons, from the smallest to these, the deepest. It is our need to hold on to belief, to meaning—logic be damned—that continues to fuel the great cons of the world, even as their contours shift with the times.

- to search for truth and discern the meaning of reality? Spiritual cons exploit us at our most vulnerable. And because the process is so natural and insidious, it is particularly difficult to resist. You become a sucker almost in spite of yourself. In a sense, then, managing to survive the cult or spiritual con—the ultimate in confidence games—is the closest we can come to ever figuring out how to avoid falling for the lure of the con man more broadly. Sullivan and Stalvey, after all, managed to infiltrate cult after cult and come out on the other side. They were, in a sense, con artists in their own right: doing the con artists one better, deceiving them into accepting that they were genuine marks who had been expertly suckered in. Sullivan was largely reticent about his specific approach—tricks of the trade, he called them—but there was one thing he stressed over and over: the key to resisting persuasion and manipulation was to have a strong, unshakeable, even, sense of self. Know who you are no matter what, and hold on to that no matter what. It isn’t easy—it was years before Sullivan was able to find a suitable female infiltrator; Stalvey, he said, was an ([Location 4596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=4596))

- exception. “It’s very rare to find someone to put into a cult. You have to have a very strong sense of your own identity,” he said. “And it’s not easy to do this. The psychological techniques that are now employed to coerce you are phenomenal.” When we spoke, Stalvey elaborated on the approach her mentor had taught her. One of the most important things, she said, was to maintain objectivity: logic to counteract feeling. You know your emotions will be manipulated—they always are, in any con, big or small. That’s the whole point of the put-up and the play. And once you become emotional, your reasoning can easily become short-circuited. “Always pay attention to the details,” she told me. That is one way to ensure that you are staying rooted in the physical, the objective, rather than the psychological, the subjective. The details themselves may be harrowing—Stalvey observed everything from physical abuse to kids banging their heads on walls to exercises in extreme shaming. “Through it all, you have to make sure you are observing as much as feeling.” Most con games, of course, don’t involve such extreme manipulation, but they all depend on the mechanism of emotion to a significant extent. A large part of resistance, of making sure you don’t start getting pulled in, is to know yourself well enough to recognize and control your emotional reactions. What kinds of things provoke what kinds of responses in me—and can I see it happening early enough to resist it, by staying grounded in details and logic? Stanford University psychologist Roderick Kramer believes that one of the ways we can inoculate ourselves against false persuasion is through self-knowledge—one of the elements that forms what Sullivan called your “core self.” Know what people you’re likely to trust, what triggers are likely to catch you, whether… ([Location 4605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01127P1OE&location=4605))
