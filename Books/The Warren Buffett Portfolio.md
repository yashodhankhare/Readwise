## Highlights
- The essence of focus investing can be stated quite simply:Choose a few stocks that are likely to produce ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=62))

- above-average returns over the long haul, concentrate the bulk of your investments in those stocks, and have the fortitude to hold steady during any short-term market gyrations.No doubt that summary statement immediately raises all sorts of questions in your mind:How do I identify those above-average stocks?How many is "a few"?What do you mean by "concentrate"?How long must I hold?And, saved for last:Why should I do this?

- From the investor's point of view, the underlying attraction of both strategies is the same: minimize risk through diversification. By holding a large number of stocks representing many industries and many sectors of the market, investors hope to create a warm blanket of protection against the horrific loss that could occur if they had all their money in one arena that suffered some disaster. In a normal period (so the thinking goes), some stocks in a diversified fund will go down… ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=85))

- better, active managers believe, as the number of stocks in the portfolio grows; ten is better than one, and a hundred is better than ten.An index fund, by definition, affords this kind of diversification if the index it mirrors is also diversified, as they usually are. The traditional stock mutual fund, with upward of a hundred stocks constantly in motion, also offers diversification.We have all heard this mantra of diversification for so long, we have become intellectually numb to its inevitable consequence: mediocre results. Although it is true that active and index funds offer diversification, in general neither… ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=88))

- What's wrong with conventional diversification? For one thing, it greatly increases the chances that you will buy something you don't know enough about. "Know-something" investors, applying the Buffett tenets, would do better to focus their attention on just a few companies-"five to ten," Buffett suggests. Others who adhere… ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=117))

- the average investor, a legitimate case can be made for ten to fifteen. Thus, to the earlier question, How many is "a few"? the short answer is: No more than fifteen. More critical than determining the exact number is understanding the general concept behind it. Focus investing falls apart if it is applied to a large portfolio with dozens of stocks.Warren Buffett often points to John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, as a source of his ideas. In 1934, Keynes wrote to a business associate: "It is a mistake to think one limits one's risks by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence.... One's knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally… ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=119))

- been duly noted. Fisher, a prominent investment counselor for nearly half a century, is the author of two important books: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Paths to Wealth Through Common Stocks, both of which Buffett admires greatly.Phil Fisher was known for his focus portfolios; he always said he preferred owning a small number of outstanding companies that he understood well to owning a large number of average ones, many of which he understood poorly. Fisher began his investment counseling business shortly after the 1929 stock market crash, and he remembers how important it was to produce good results. "Back then, there was no room for mistakes," he remembers. "I knew the more I understood about the company the better off I would be."5 As a general rule, Fisher limited his portfolios… ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=125))

More than forty years later, Fisher, who today is ninety-one, has not changed his mind. "Great stocks are extremely hard to find," he told me. "If they weren't, then everyone would own them. I knew I wanted to own the best or none at all." 7Ken Fisher, the son of Phil Fisher, is also a successful money manager. He summarizes his… ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=130))

- countless field trips tovisit companies he was interested in. If he liked what he saw, he did not hesitate to invest a significant amount of money in the company. Ken Fisher points out, "My dad saw what it meant to have a large position in something that paid off."9Today, Warren Buffett echoes that thinking: "With each investment you make, you should have the courage and the conviction to place at least 10 percent of your net worth in that stock."10You can see why Buffett says the ideal portfolio should contain no more than ten stocks, if each is to receive 10 percent. Yet focus investing is not a simple matter of finding ten good stocks and dividing your investment pool equally among them. Even though all the stocks in a focus portfolio are high-probability events, some will inevitably be higher than… ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=136))

Along with probability theory, mathematics provides another piece of the focus investing rationale: the Kelly Optimization Model.

- or the near-term expectation for a company's earnings can affect share prices. But as the time horizon lengthens, the trend-line economics of the underlying business will increasingly dominate its share price.How long is that ideal time line? As you might imagine, there is no hard and fast rule (although Buffett would probably say that any span shorter than five years is a fool's theory). The goal is not zero turnover; that would be foolish in the opposite direction because it would prevent you from taking advantage of something better when it comes along. I suggest that, as a general rule of thumb, we should be thinking of a turnover… ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=152))

(OID)11 Charlie worked through several scenarios, including the number of stocks he would need in the portfolio and what kind of volatility he could expect. It was a straightforward calculation."I knew from being a poker player that you have to bet heavily when you've got huge odds in your favor," Charlie said. He concluded that as long as he could handle the price volatility, owning as few as three stocks would be plenty. "I knew I could handle the bumps psychologically," he said, "because I was raised by people who believe in handling bumps. So I was an ideal person to adopt my own methodology."

- In summary, the process of focus investing involves these actions:• Using the tenets of the Warren Buffett Way, choose a few (ten to fifteen) outstanding companies that have achieved above-average returns in the past and that you believe have a high probability of continuing their past strong performance into the future.• Allocate your investment funds proportionately, placing the biggest bets on the highest-probability events.• As long as things don't deteriorate, leave the portfolio largely… ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=181))

He believes that the only way to achieve wisdom is to be able to hang life's experience across a broad cross-section of mental models.

- to embrace models from several different disciplines. Becoming a successful investor, he explains, requires a multidiscipline approach to your thinking.That approach will put you in a different place from almost everyone else, Charlie points out, because the world is not multidiscipline. Business professors typically don't include physics in their lectures, and physics teachers don't include biology, and biology teachers don't include mathematics, and mathematicians rarely include psychology in their coursework. According to Charlie, we must ignore these "intellectual jurisdictional boundaries" and include all models in our latticework design."I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models,"… ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=197))

Yet, for finance professionals, the second period is almost as important, for it represents a very important watershed in the history of modern finance and, particularly in the development of modern portfolio theory.Looking back now with the clarity of hindsight, we can see that two very different schools of thought, which today still engage inserious debate about investment philosophy, had their beginnings during this two-year debacle. Two separate groups of people in the investment world searched for the best way to respond, and arrived at different conclusions. Actually, rather than describe them as two groups, it's probably more accurate to say that the… ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=217))

Mortgage rates were so high that very few middle-income families could afford to buy a new home. It was a dark, brutal time.

Yet that brief article is today credited with launching modern finance.'From Markowitz's standpoint, it didn't take volumes to explain what he believed was a rather simple notion: return and risk are inextricably linked. As an economist, he believed it was possible to quantify the relationship between the two to a statistically valid degree, and thus determine the degree of risk that would be required for various levels of return. In his paper, he presented the calculations that supported his conclusion: no investor can achieve above-average gains without assuming above-average risk."I was struck with the notion… ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=244))

- In 1959, Markowitz published his first book, Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investment, based on his PhD dissertation. In it, he described more thoroughly his ideas about risk. "I used standard deviation as a measure of risk," Markowitz explains. Variance (deviation) can be thought of as the distance from the average; according to Markowitz, the greater the distance from the average, the greater the risk.We might think the riskiness of a portfolio, as defined by Markowitz, is simply the weighted average variance of all the individual stocks in the portfolio. But this misses a crucial point. Although variance may provide a gauge to the riskiness of an… ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GXQOJ6&location=257))
