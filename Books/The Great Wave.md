- Only one type of source-material spans the entire range of written history: the record of prices. We carry these humble documents about with us every day, in the tattered receipts that accumulate in our wallets and purses. They seem so ephemeral that we scarcely think of them in historical terms, and yet they survive in greater abundance than any other quantifiable material. Price-records come down to us from ancient civilizations of Asia, India, Rome, Greece, Egypt, Palestine and Mesopotamia. In the dust of old Babylon, archeologists have found large numbers of clay tablets and cylinders that yield price-series as early as the reign of Hammurapi (circa 1793–1750 B.C.). In the deserts of Egypt, scholars have found papyri that record the cost of living in the time of the Pharaohs. The civilizations of Greece and Rome, China and India all generated a large body of price-records. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=204))

- There are as many ways to study a price series as to read a text. On the surface, prices are a running record of the cost of commodities as they change hands in the market. This is their most common and familiar meaning. At the same time, they may also be studied in a different way, as evidence of the changing value of money—which is how some economists prefer to think of them. On a third level, prices tell us about systems of production, and especially about structures of exchange—a subject of growing historical importance, as scholars begin to discover that processes of exchange may have played much of the role that Marx attributed to the means of production.

- On a fourth plane of abstraction, prices become a source for the study of broad historical movements. To look at the movement of prices in the United States during the nineteenth century, for example, is to see many things through that one particular lens. In the ebb and flow of American prices we may observe the cultural effect of the Jacksonian movement, the social impact of the Civil War, the chronology of the industrial revolution and the geography of the westward movement. Historical happenings as evanescent as moods of hope and fear may be measured with high precision by a study of prices. In the history of the American Civil War, a sensitive indicator of northern hopes was the changing price of government bonds from 1861 to 1865. A barometer of southern fears was the price of slaves as it rose and fell through the same period. Price movements are a powerful source of inferential knowledge about changing historical conditions and events. At a still higher level of abstraction, prices may be studied as clues to the nature of change itself. That is the purpose of this inquiry. Every period of the past has been a time of change. The world is always changing—but not always in the same way. We shall find empirical evidence of distinct “change-regimes” in the past that were often highly dynamic, but stable in their dynamism. Sooner or later, even the strongest of these change-regimes broke down in moments of what might be called “deep change.” When it did so, one system of change yielded to another. Deep change may be understood as a change in the structure of change itself. In the language of mathematics, deep change is the second derivative. It may be calculated as a rate of change in rates of change. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=224))

- The method of this inquiry is to describe and hopefully to explain the rhythm of change regimes and deep change in price movements during the past eight hundred years. The purpose is to enlarge our understanding not only of prices in particular, but also of change in general. Large questions about the nature of change have tended to belong more to philosophers than historians, and have been studied mostly by methods of deduction. The growing accessibility of quantitative evi-dence allows us to convert a metaphysical conundrum into an empirical question. Dr. Samuel Johnson would have… ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=236))

- Another problem operates on an entirely different level. In periods of deep change, understanding lags behind the movement of events. The world changes faster than our thoughts about it. For example, in the late 1990s, central bankers in many countries continued to think of themselves as inflation-fighters ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=258))

- fighters in a new era when greater dangers rose from disinflation or even deflation. Economists in the 1990s (monetarists especially) predicted that large increases in the money supply would cause inflation to pick up again, as would have happened a generation ago. But other factors have been more powerful. In the United States problems of economic understanding have been compounded by the effect of economic prosperity. The Japanese in World War II spike ruefully of shoribyo or “victory disease.” The Greeks called it hubris, and thought that it always ended in the intervention of the goddess Nemesis. That lady makes her appearance when wave-riders begin to believe that they are wave-makers, at the moment when the great wave breaks and begins to gather its energy again.

- THE HISTORY OF PRICES is a history of change. A helpful perspective on the troubles of our time is a remarkable record of English “consumable” prices since the year 1264, compiled with great care by Henry Phelps-Brown and Sheila Hopkins. This index shows that market prices of food, drink, fuel and textiles in the south of England have tended to rise for more than seven hundred years, at an average rate of about one percent each year.2 ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=274))

- Economists in the United States also have little memory of these historical events, except for the price-revolution of the sixteenth century, which is distantly remembered as proving the truth of the axiom that inflation is “always and everywhere primarily a monetary phenomenon,” as the American economist Milton Friedman wrote in another context.

- This collective amnesia is partly the consequence of an attitude widely shared among decision-makers in America, that history is more or less irrelevant to the urgent problems before them. An exception shows the power of this rule. In 1980, American economist Lester Thurow advised his colleagues that they could not understand the inflationary surges of that era ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=327))

- business leaders, journalists, investors, and ordinary citizens. Today, we are living in the late stages of the price revolution of the twentieth century. Disaster does not necessarily lie ahead for us. This book does not predict the apocalypse. It does not attempt to tell the future. To the contrary, it finds that uncertainty about the future is an inexorable fact of our condition. But it also finds evidence that what happens in the future is contingent on our choices in the present, which derive from our memory of the past. The result of this inquiry strongly suggests that when we make our economic choices, we would do well to improve our powers of recall, and to remember some very hard-won lessons of historical experience. If our purpose is to master the dangerous dynamics of our contemporary world, or merely to survive them, then we must remember the past—even the distant past. We must also learn to think of the present and future as part of an historical continuum. Many readers who are literate in economics will remember the special meaning of the Keynesian dictum that in the long run we are all dead. The events of the twentieth century should have taught us that this idea, in its most common application, is very much mistaken. American economist Herbert Stein, after a term of service in Washington, wrote ruefully in 1979, “we woke up to discover that we were living in the long run, and were suffering for our failure to look after it.”10 To that end, this history begins more than seven centuries ago, on a market day in a medieval cathedral-town. The date was September 8, 1224. The place was Chartres. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=377))

- The Discovery of Inflation, 1938–63 Through all of these turbulent events, global prices continued to rise in peace as well as war. Even as price surges were restrained in some nations by strict controls, the secular trend moved inexorably upward. In the United States from 1938 to 1963, consumer prices rose every year but two. During the span of an entire generation, inflation was the rule in twenty-three years out of twenty-five. One result was a growth of what Americans called an “inflationary psychology.” The existence of inflation as a secular trend began to be discovered by individuals, corporations, and governments throughout the world.16 American historian Eric Goldman lived through this period in the United States. “Inflation jabbed people wherever they turned,” he remembered. “Trolleys and subways went up two cents, then a nickel. The ten-cent Sunday newspaper was disappearing in America. Still more irritating were things that were hard to buy at any price. A public with billions of dollars ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=2915))

- stored up in war bonds and savings accounts . . . found itself queuing up in long nerve-jangling lines. Women had trouble getting furniture, nylons, a new electric iron; men found clothing, even a razor blade that would shave clean, in short supply. . . . As the summer of 1946 closed, the food shortages were reaching their climax. First came a meteoric rise in prices. . . . Gradually the store shelves began to fill; within months of the election of 1946, steaks and roasts were no longer drawing crowds. . . . Prices kept on climbing. Even the kids of Cape Cod resort towns, who for years had dived to retrieve pennies thrown in the water by vacationers, now refused to budge except for nickels. But the public was learning to live with inflation.”17 In the years after World War II, this underlying inflationary psychology firmly established itself in North America and western Europe. People tried to make light of the problem. American humorist Max Kauffman observed, “Among the things that money can’t buy is everything it used to.” Vaudeville comedian Henny Youngman remarked, “Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two people to carry ten dollars’ worth of groceries. Today, a five-year-old can do it.” The inflation jokes of the 1950s expressed a growing mood of fatalism about price movements. That attitude encouraged pessimism about the possibility of restraining inflation and caused people to seek other remedies. These new responses caused more inflation and increased its momentum. They also institutionalized its dynamics within entire cultural systems. This had happened in every other price-revolution, but during the twentieth century, the institutional machinery of ([Location 2923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=2923))

- modern society had grown stronger and more complex than before. Institutional responses to rising prices reinforced inflation more powerfully than in earlier waves. Industrial democracies began to create elaborate systems of institutional price-inflators, which economist Robert Heilbroner described as regulatory “floors without ceilings.” Price floors were constructed in many sectors of the American economy. In some industries, “administered prices” became commonplace. In others, prices were formally fixed by regulatory agencies, and by “fair trade” statutes that forbade merchants to sell below the manufacturer’s “suggested retail price.” The dynamic American responses to price floors were not price ceilings, but wage floors. In 1938, the Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, which set the first national minimum wage. It also briefly considered a maximum wage, but that idea was quickly forgotten. Thereafter, the minimum wage was frequently raised, and extended more broadly through the economy. Similar laws were enacted in other nations. This legislation helps to explain one of the distinctive features of the price-revolution in the twentieth century—its exceptionally high rate of advance.18 In the period from 1938 to 1968, many inflationary floors were built into the American economy: floors under wages, pensions, and compensation for… ([Location 2935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=2935))

- without ceilings accelerated a dynamic process called the wage-price spiral by conservatives, and the price-wage spiral by liberals. The institutionalization of inflation in the twentieth century was not limited to price and wage regulation itself. Systemic restraints were placed also upon supply. Many nations imposed limits on production: farm products in the United States, oil in Saudi Arabia, coffee in Colombia, gold in South Africa, and many other commodities throughout the world. International cartels pursued the same policy where they were able to do so. The classic example was the price of diamonds, which the De Beers syndicate inflated to many times their market value by restrictions on supply and other methods. From a functional perspective, it mattered not at all whether these policies were imposed by a national government, or an international cartel, or a corporate manager. The impact on prices was the same. Wherever supply was held down, prices tended to rise. The integrated international economy of the twentieth century created many opportunities, and put them in the hands of small groups who profited by their application. Other new structural causes of inflation began to operate in the mid-twentieth century. One of them was invented by American businessmen.

- their product, advertising relentlessly, packaging it in a different form, and raising its unit price. As a case in point, Slawson studied the price history of American candy bars. During the late 1950s, the going price of a candy bar was five cents. By 1983, it had risen to thirty-five cents. The price was deliberately raised in a series of small five-cent increments by manufacturers. Slawson found that “each increase was disguised by making the bar larger at the same time—the size of the bar having been gradually decreased since the time of the last price rise. People generally choose candy bars on the basis of taste and size, neither of which encourages them to make close distinctions on the basis of price. Moreover, the manufacturers, one assumes deliberately, make size difficult to assess by making the wrappers larger than the bars inside, and by using a wide variety of shapes.”19 The laws of neo-classical economics are unable to explain the price history of the American candy bar in the twentieth century. Market competition remained strong among candy-makers—in some respects, stronger than ever before. But it was no longer primarily price competition, and its effect on prices was the reverse of what neoclassical economic theory would lead us to expect. The more competitive the candy market became in America during the twentieth century, the more prices rose.20 Economist Slawson argued that there was little difference in pricing strategies used for candy bars, automobiles, airline tickets, and other goods and services. He developed a model of a new “competitive inflation” to describe a world of growing complexity in pricing decisions by corporate sellers, and of increasing… ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=2959))

- Price rises remained comparatively moderate in the North American economy, which restrained the world inflation-rate until 1965. Then they also began to accelerate, partly because President Lyndon Johnson and his advisors made a major miscalculation. The Johnson administration decided to expand public spending for social welfare in the United States and simultaneously fight a major war in Southeast Asia, without a large increase in taxes. In the journalistic jargon of the day, they believed that the booming American economy could supply both “guns and butter” at the same time.

- A similar pattern appeared in the association between prices and unemployment. When the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent, the rate of inflation advanced more rapidly. When unemployment rose above that level, inflation retreated. Clearly, the price-revolution of the twentieth century was embedded in demographic trends and economic structures. As early as 1966, American leaders began to show concern about rising prices and acted forcefully to restrain them. The expansion of the money supply (M-I) was brought to a dead ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3005))

- halt in the second quarter of 1966. Interest rates were raised deliberately to their highest levels in half a century, in what was called the credit crunch of 1966. An economist observes that this was “the first occasion in the post World War II period that the Fed sharply cut back monetary growth and caused rapid and, for a time, large increases in interest rates.”7 As these policies took effect, the prosperous American economy skidded into a brief “mini-recession” in 1967. But inflation did not end. Consumer prices continued to climb, and by 1968 the buoyant American economy began to boom again. As inflationary pressures mounted, public officials in the Johnson administration and the Federal Reserve Board once again adopted policies of economic restraint. They tightened credit, applied various fiscal restrictions, drove interest rates higher, increased taxes by a 10 percent surcharge on incomes, and curbed monetary growth in early 1969. These measures were deliberately intended to create what was called a “policy recession.” They succeeded all too well. In 1969, anti-inflationary measures began to have an effect, but not precisely the one that was intended. After the long boom of the 1960s, the American economy went into steep decline, dragging other nations with it. The recession of 1968–71, writes economist Robert Gordon, combined “the worst of three worlds.” One might say that it combined the worst of five worlds. National product diminished. Unemployment rose sharply. The dollar fell against other currencies, and yet the American balance of payments rapidly deteriorated. Through it all, inflation stubbornly persisted in a new combination with ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3008))

Some believed it to be an unprecedented anomaly. In fact, stagflation had happened in the later stages of every price-revolution from the thirteenth century to our own time.

- Once more prices began to advance rapidly. This time, leaders of the administration tried to restrain them by a policy of moral suasion called “jawboning” in the jargon of the day. The only discernible effect of jawboning was an inflation of rhetoric that kept pace with rising prices. The cost of living kept on climbing. Later in his beleaguered presidency, Nixon wanted to freeze prices again. His neoclassical economic advisers firmly resisted that idea. Herbert Stein remembers: “I warned him, citing Heraclitus, that you can’t step in the same river twice.” Nixon replied, “you can if it’s frozen.” But controls had become politically untenable, whatever their economic merits may have been.10 ([Location 3046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3046))

- These acts were not unprecedented. Twice before the Arab states had tried to use oil as a strategic weapon. Twice the United States had stabilized prices by drawing on its vast petroleum reserves. By 1973, however, the American reserves were nearly gone, and the United States had become a heavy importer of foreign oil. It was powerless to stop OPEC by anything short of military action, which for a time was seriously considered by the Nixon administration. Within a few months, oil prices quadrupled. The American reaction, writes oil expert John M. Blair, “approached pure panic.” Governments, corporations, and individuals were entirely unprepared for this turn of events. Many American families and institutions found their budgets strained beyond the breaking point. In Europe, energy-poor industries collapsed. Unemployment soared. The worst suffering occurred in the third world, where fragile economies were cruelly shattered by the actions of the OPEC cartel.11 ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3059))

- Inflation moderated in 1976–77, largely because of the disruption of the world economy and the decline of demand, but annual price increases continued in the range of 6 percent—an exceptionally high level by historic standards. The stubborn persistence of inflation, and the recent failure of so many policies created a painful dilemma for national leaders. In the United States, the new Carter administration acted on the advice of neo-classical economists and promoted a new idea called “deregulation,” partly in the hope of removing regulatory “floors” under price and wages. The effect of “deregulation” did not as a rule remove the floors themselves. It ([Location 3081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3081))

- merely removed control of them from the public to the private sector. Inflation continued, now in company with growing inequalities of income. During the late 1970s, consumer prices in the United States accelerated sharply yet again, in another surge of increasing volatility. Once more the OPEC cartel played a leading role. In 1978–79, it ruthlessly raised the price of oil to such a height that the United States was paying nearly $100 billions a year to oil-producing nations. The annual rate of inflation in consumer prices reached 13.5 percent in 1980, a new peacetime record in American history.

- The tightly controlled Communist economies of eastern Europe were also caught up in the great wave, but in a different way. Prices and wages were held ruthlessly in check by the instruments of a totalitarian state, but state planners were not able to restrain the pressures of aggregate demand. The result was the development of rationing, the Communist alternative to inflation. In the western world, rising prices were themselves a system of market-rationing which allocated scarce resources to those who were willing and able to pay higher prices. The Communist system substituted state-rationing for market-rationing. Throughout eastern Europe the same scenes were enacted. Long queues, empty shops, and meatless meals became the Marxist surrogate for price-inflation. State-rationing, continued year after year, engendered problems of deep corruption in Communist nations. Corrupt regimes that ruled in the name of the people rapidly lost their moral legitimacy. Free-market nations tried to protect themselves against inflation by adopting autarchic policies, with consequences that caused major economic problems throughout the world. The leading example was Japan, which was highly vulnerable to commodity cartels. To pay its soaring oil bills, the Japanese flooded the world market with exports. In America alone, the total value of Japanese goods rose from five billion dollars in 1970 to thirty billions only a decade later. At the same time, the Japanese actively discouraged imports to their own economy. The result was the growth of large imbalances in international trade, and the collapse of many American industries. Unemployment surged in the United States, while inflation continued at high levels. In 1979–80, the liberal Democratic administration of Jimmy Carter declared inflation to be the nation’s “number one problem.” On the advice of economists, and in alliance with Chairman Paul Volcker, a deeply conservative banker who headed the Federal Reserve Board, a southern Populist president adopted highly repressive economic policies. Interest rates were raised to record heights. The money supply was restrained. Taxes were allowed to reach the highest peacetime levels in American history, mainly as a consequence of inflationary “bracket creep,” which carried most Americans into higher tax brackets. A major effort was made to reduce American dependence on foreign oil. In the last months of the Carter administration these policies began to take effect. The American economy faltered and turned sharply downward. Inflation began to subside. But new problems began to appear. Major instabilities developed in commodity markets. The United States and other nations had responded to rising the cost of energy by increasing domestic production of oil, by shifting to other fuels, and by reducing demand for energy. These measures succeeded beyond expectations. Their effect was to solve one problem by creating another—the energy glut of the 1980s. Suddenly, the world found… ([Location 3097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3097))

- by high executives in the major oil corporations and shipping companies was long rows of idle supertankers, rusting at their moorings in Norwegian fjords during the early 1980s. These ships had been ordered during the OPEC oil famine. They had been completed just in time for the glut that followed. Many were among the largest ships ever constructed. Some were destined never to sail except to the breakers’ yards. The shipbuilding industry had expanded to meet the demand for these new ships. Now it found itself with excess capacity, and collapsed with a resounding crash throughout the world.15 Similar reversals also occurred in other sectors of the world economy, notably in agriculture. During the early 1970s, high food prices had sent production soaring. American farmers borrowed heavily to increase production. Then, in the 1980s, the world found itself producing more food than it could consume. American farmers were faced with saturated markets, heavy debts, and excess capacity. They began to go bankrupt in numbers unprecedented even in the Great Depression. Meanwhile, politically powerful European farmers, encouraged by price supports, kept producing a vast surplus which was purchased by the European Economic Community and stored in “butter mountains” and “wine lakes.” India and other developing nations, with the aid of new farming methods in the “green revolution,” also began to produce more food than they consumed, and agricultural markets were glutted round the world. Market-instability was intensified by the acts of private speculators. The effect of increasing wealth concentration was to increase the supply of surplus capital, which shifted rapidly ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3119))

- from one investment opportunity to another throughout the world in search of profit. The increasing liquidity and volatility of markets created opportunities that were aggressively pursued, sometimes less for profit than for sport. Some of these speculations succeeded; others failed; all of them together contributed to the growing instability of the world economy. An example was the silver bubble of the 1970s. In 1973, the Hunt family of Texas, at that time possibly the richest family in America, decided to buy precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Gold could not be held by private citizens in the United States at that time, and so the Hunts began to buy silver in enormous quantity, perhaps even hoping to corner the world silver market—a wild speculation reminiscent of Colebrook’s alum scheme in the price-revolution of the eighteenth century. Silver prices surged from $1.94 an ounce in 1973 to $50.35 in 1980. The corner failed, and the Hunt family fell deep in debt. By 1987, their liabilities had grown to nearly $2.5 billion, against assets of $1.5 billion. America’s richest family slipped to the edge of bankruptcy, and the shock waves spread through the economy.16 After 1981, the Reagan administration created new opportunities for speculators and corporate raiders by relaxing antitrust rules and promoting business deregulation. “Hostile takeovers” and “… ([Location 3131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3131))

- were destroyed by the same process. Healthy corporations with strong balance sheets, cash reserves, and an active sense of civic responsibility were specially at risk. Some of the best and most responsible American companies such as Dayton-Hudson and Phillips Petroleum, outstanding corporate citizens with strong balance sheets, were compelled assume crushing debt in an effort to fight off hostile takeovers. The result of this activity was growing instability in the economic life of the nation. In the mid-1980s, the new electronic technology of securities markets increased speculative instabilities of another kind. Chicago’s Mercantile Exchange invented futures-trading in stocks, with lower margin requirements than the stock exchanges themselves. This created opportunities for traders to shift their money back and forth from stocks to stock futures, and to extract large profits from small disparities. The work was done by “programmed trading,” in which computers sent automatic signals to buy and sell when stocks and stock-futures reached predetermined levels. Programmed trading increased the volatility of securities markets. Buffers that had been invented after the Great Depression were unable to restrain this new technology. Stock values soared in 1987, and Wall Street became a great casino. Millions of small investors were caught up in the speculative mania.

On the morning after, some experts explained that the collapse was merely a massive correction of grossly inflated stock-prices. They did not ask how the inflation had happened in the first place. Others believed that the crash was caused by programmed trading in stock futures on commodity exchanges where margin requirements were low or nonexistent. Many small investors concluded that financial markets had become corrupt casinos, in which the games were rigged by insiders. After the crash, the confidence of investors collapsed, and the stock market was unable to serve its primary economic function of mobilizing capital for investment. In 1988, more than 100 major American corporations found themselves unable to issue new stock offerings for their capital needs. Neither the securities industry nor… ([Location 3156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3156))

- In the 1980s, the battered world economy slipped into another recession. This one was deep—the deepest since the 1930s. It was marked by excess capacity and plummeting commodity prices. Producer prices of food and raw materials fell steeply from 1981 to 1986, reaching their lowest levels since the Great Depression. Oil declined from $40 a barrel to $8 in 1986. Tin dropped from $8 a pound to $2.50; copper slipped from $1 to 45 cents; silver plummeted from $54 to less than $5 an ounce. But even in the very depth of this recession, consumer prices continued their inexorable advance. Inflation slowed, but did not cease.17 When the major industrial economies began to revive, prices of raw materials started to climb again. In 1987, the price of oil doubled. Cotton and lead trebled. Strong upward trends appeared in the price of copper, nickel, aluminum, wool, hides and rubber. Overall, commodity prices rose by nearly one-third in a single year, and further increases followed in 1988.18 A large part of this increase was due to hoarding, in fear of higher prices ahead. Economic forecasters predicted further price increases, and an inflationary psychology rapidly strengthened throughout the world. Fear of inflation began to be more disruptive than inflation itself. The expectation of rising prices caused prices to rise higher.19 By 1989, as producer prices were rising sharply, world leaders openly discussed the need for driving the economies of the industrial world into a yet another “policy recession.” They did so at a time when markets and economies were deeply unstable. Governments worked to “cool” their economies by raising interest rates. In the United States, the Federal Funds Rate was driven up from 6.7 percent in 1987 to 9.2 percent in 1990. Consumer interest rates climbed much higher. Other fiscal and monetary measures were also adopted, but now that price controls were discredited, the remedy for double-digit inflation was double-digit interest. This policy of using high interest rates to control high inflation had many economic and social effects. It increased inequality, discouraged investment, diminished productivity, reduced demand, and drove up unemployment. Ironically, in some ways it also promoted inflation. The cost of housing, for example, rose sharply in part because home construction was inflated by builders’ capital costs, which increased… ([Location 3165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3165))

- Through it all, consumer prices kept on climbing. Economic managers nervously shifted their weight from accelerators to brakes, then back to accelerators and once more to brakes. Inflation diminished but did not disappear. In early 1995, prices rose at annual rates of 4 percent in Germany, 6 percent in Britain and Switzerland, 8 percent in Italy and Spain. Lower rates prevailed in Japan and the United States, where some observers argued that inflation had been conquered. It was not so. Prices continued to outpace wages. Real income fell, and families were… ([Location 3197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3197))

- These stresses rose directly from the structure of the price-revolution itself. Every great wave had been much the same that way. In the late stages of these long movements, severe strains began to develop within social systems. The damage was done not by price-inflation itself, but by disparities in its operation. Some prices inflated more rapidly than others. Price-relatives were much the same as in every long wave since the middle ages. Once again, as thrice before, soaring prices of food and energy and raw materials had led the inflationary advance. Prices of manufactured products such as cars, textiles, appliances, toys, leisure goods, and furniture all lagged behind. The cause was the same as in every other price-revolution. The consequences fell most cruelly upon the poor, who paid a large proportion of their income for food, fuel and shelter.20 Suffering was compounded by wage-movements after 1975. During the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, workers had done better than in previous price-revolutions. In the United States real wages kept rising through most of the period from 1896 to 1975.21 The cause was to be found in a combination of union activity, minimum… ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3203))

- Figure 4.18 shows a pattern of price relatives in the 20th century that was broadly similar to earlier price revolutions, but different in important details. Once again the cost of energy, raw materials and farm products led the advance. Once more, wages and manufactures lagged behind. Two differences separated the 20th century price revolution from its predecessors. The cost of food increased less rapidly, re, relative to other raw materials; and wages rose a little more rapidly in relative terms, though still falling behind the cost of living. The source is Statistical Abstract of the United States (1978) 765. While real wages fell, returns to capital rose more rapidly than the general price level. This was most dramatically so for landed capital. The cost of rent and real estate in the United States multiplied sixfold from 1960 to 1992, while the consumer price index increased threefold. Prime real estate went up tenfold or more. On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, a cooperative apartment that had gone for $60,000 in 1968 rose as high as $600,000 twenty years later. In Boston suburbs with good schools, modest homes that sold for $20,000 in 1965 brought $400,000 in 1986. Similar trends occurred in western Europe and east Asia. In Tokyo, prime commercial real estate rose so high that it was sold by the square meter, at prices between $200,000 and $300,000 for an area 40 inches on a side.24 Interest rates also increased more rapidly than prices. During the early years of the twentieth century, interest had… ([Location 3215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3215))

- Figure 4.19 shows the long fall in real wages that began circa 1970, and continued with brief reversals to 1996. The price revolution of the twentieth century had differed from its predecessors in the rise of real wages before 1970. Thereafter, it conformed to the common pattern. Returns to labor fell for American workers, both blue collar and white collar, while returns to capital increased. The result was a growth of inequality that appears in figure 4.22 below.

In other price-revolutions, rates of interest had risen more rapidly than prices, but this time another factor was also at work. During the late twentieth century, interest rates were deliberately driven up as a way of managing the economy and controlling inflation. When prices accelerated, the central banks raised interest rates to depress demand. In periods of recession, interest rates were driven down to stimulate economic growth. That, at least, was the idea. In practice the policy was distorted by a classic example of a “ratchet-effect,” which allowed rates to move more freely up than down. When the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates in the United States, retail bankers instantly passed on the increase to their borrowers. When the Fed lowered interest, the banks were slower to follow suit. From 1970 to 1981, for example, the Federal Funds Rate rose from 7.2 to 16.4 percent, and the cost of a conventional fixed-rate,… ([Location 3238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3238))

When real wages fell and real returns to capital increased, the social consequences were inexorable. Inequality increased.

- The American national debt, large as it may have been, was only a small part of total indebtedness in the United States. While federal indebtedness soared above $1 trillion, private individual debt rose beyond $2 trillion, and debts owed by business corporations—the most profligate borrowers of all—exceeded $3 trillion. By 1987, the United States had become the world’s leading debtor nation. This mountain of debt created dangerous imbalances in the American financial system. In Illinois, Texas, California and New York, some of the nation’s biggest banks failed during the 1980s. Government intervention succeeded in preventing a general collapse, but by 1989 the American banking system had become the hostage of economic fortune. Any sort of setback—an international crisis, an economic recession, a rogue trader, or a run of bad weather—threatened major disaster. Even more unstable than the banks were savings and loan associations. After deregulation, these institutions were so badly managed that by 1988 more than 500 were near bankruptcy, and the price of solvency was a huge taxpayer “bailout” which deepened Federal deficits. Investigators calculated that half of the losses were caused in part by fraud. Instabilities also developed in international trade. The economic policies of the leading western nations differed profoundly in the 1980s. In the United States, the Reagan administration adopted “supply-side” policies ([Location 3278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3278))

- WORKS ON THIS subject often end with a book of Revelations, or at least a chapter of Jeremiah, in which the reader is warned that we are heading for disaster—unless the author’s ideas are speedily enacted. These dark prophecies find a growing market with modern readers, who appear to have an insatiable appetite for predictions of their own impending doom. Even when prophecies fail, they are merely updated and sell briskly once again. They call to mind the career of the Reverend Samuel Miller, a Baptist minister in nineteenth century New England, who predicted that the world would end no later than December 31, 1843. When the fatal day approached, the Prophet discovered an error in his computations. He announced that the last trump had been rescheduled to March 21, 1844. His followers grew to many hundreds. They donned special “resurrection robes” and gathered to await the day of judgment. But Samuel Miller found another mistake in his arithmetic, and postponed the end of the world once again, this time to October 22, 1844. The faithful were undeterred. Their numbers rose so high that on the appointed day, business came to a halt in parts of New England. But Samuel Miller revised his numbers yet again and went on prophesying until his end arrived—without warning—in 1849.2 Those who believe that the economic future has been revealed to them should remember the story of Samuel Miller. They might also reflect on the wisdom of John Kenneth Galbraith, who observes that “the most common qualification of the economic forecaster is not in knowing, but in not knowing that he does not know. His greatest advantage is that all predictions, right or wrong, are soon forgotten.”3 Historians have special reasons for caution, for they will recall the fate of earlier attempts to know the future. They also have problems enough with the past. Further, they understand that predictions fail not because historical knowledge is limited, but because of the nature of history itself. We are not merely the objects of history but also its agents. The future is determined partly by free choices that people willfully make, often in unexpected ways. These human choices are not always rational. They flow from hopes and fears, truths and errors, memories and dreams. They are unpredictable, and sometimes unimaginable, before they are made. The history of prices offers many examples. No economic forecaster could have predicted (or even imagined) that a president as conservative as Richard Nixon would become a convert to Keynesian economics in 1971, or that a president as liberal as Jimmy Carter would adopt conservative fiscal policies in 1978, or that any president in his right mind would have embraced the “supply-side” nostrums called Reaganomics in 1981. Each of these individual choices made a difference in the history of prices. All of them were freely made—sometimes defiantly against reason, interest and the economic odds. As long as this is so, history will never be a… ([Location 3459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3459))

- past eight hundred years. The central finding may be summarized in a sentence. We found evidence of four price-revolutions since the twelfth century: four very long waves of rising prices, punctuated by long periods of comparative price-equilibrium. This is not a cyclical pattern. Price revolutions have no fixed and regular periodicity. Some were as short as eighty years; others as long as 180 years. They differed in duration, velocity, magnitude, and momentum. At the same time, these long movements shared several properties in common. All had a common wave-structure, and started in much the same way. The first stage was one of silent beginnings and slow advances. Prices rose slowly in a period of prolonged prosperity. Magnitudes of increase remained within the range of previous fluctuations. At first the long wave appeared to be merely another short-run event. Only later did it emerge as a new secular tendency. The novelty of the new trend consisted not only in the fact of inflation but also in its form. The pattern of price-relatives was specially revealing. Food and fuel led the upward movement. Manufactured goods and services lagged behind. These patterns indicated that the prime mover was excess aggregate demand, generated by an acceleration of population growth, or by rising living standards, or both. These trends were the product of individual choices. Men and women deliberately chose to marry early. They freely decided to have more children, because material conditions were improving and the world seemed a better place to raise a family. People demanded and at first received a higher standard of living, because there was an expanding market for their labor. The first stage of every price-revolution was marked by material progress, cultural confidence, and optimism for the future. The second stage was very different. It began when prices broke through the boundaries of the previous equilibrium. This tended to happen when other events intervened—commonly wars of ambition that arose from the hubris of the preceding period. Examples included the rivalry between emperors and popes in the thirteenth century; the state-building conflicts of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries; the dynastic and imperial struggles of the mid-eighteenth century; and the world wars of the twentieth century. These events sent prices surging up and down again, in a pattern that was both a symptom and a cause of instability. The consequences included political disorder, social disruption, and a growing mood of cultural anxiety. The third stage began when people discovered the fact of price inflation as a long-term trend, and began to think of it as an inexorable condition. They responded to this discovery by making choices that drove prices still higher. Governments and individuals expanded the supply of money and increased the velocity of its circulation. In each successive wave, price-inflation became more elaborately institutionalized. A fourth stage… ([Location 3486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3486))

- increasing volatility. Severe price shocks were felt in commodity movements. The money supply was alternately expanded and contracted. Financial markets became unstable. Government spending grew faster than revenue, and public debt increased at a rapid rate. In every price-revolution, the strongest nation-states suffered severely from fiscal stresses: Spain in the sixteenth century, France in the eighteenth century, and the United States in the twentieth century. Other imbalances were even more dangerous. Wages, which had at first kept up with prices, now lagged behind. Returns to labor declined while returns to land and capital increased. The rich grew richer. People of middling estates lost ground. The poor suffered terribly. Inequalities of wealth and income increased. So also did hunger, homelessness, crime, violence, drink, drugs, and family disruption. These material events had cultural consequences. In literature and the arts, the penultimate stage of every price-revolution was an era of dark visions and restless dreams. This was a time of lost faith in institutions. It was also a period of desperate search for spiritual values. Sects and cults, often very angry and irrational, multiplied rapidly. Intellectuals turned furiously against their environing societies.… ([Location 3508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3508))

- the pressures that had set the price-revolution in motion. The first result was a rapid fall of prices, rents and interest. This short but very sharp deflation was followed by an era of equilibrium that persisted for seventy or eighty years. Long-term inflation ceased. Prices stabilized, then declined further, and stabilized once more. Real wages began to rise, but returns to capital and land fell. The recovery of equilibrium had important social consequences. At first, inequalities continued to grow, as a lag effect of the preceding price revolution. But as the new dynamics took hold, inequality began to diminish. Times were better for laborers, artisans, and ordinary people. Landowners were hard pressed, but economic conditions improved for most people. Families grew stronger. Crime rates fell. Consumption of drugs and drink diminished. Foreign wars became less frequent and less violent, but internal wars of unification became more common and more successful. Each period of equilibrium had a distinct cultural character. All were marked in their later stages by the emergence of ideas of order and harmony such as appeared in the Renaissance of the twelfth century, the Italian Renaissance of the quattrocento, the Enlightenment of the early eighteenth century,… ([Location 3519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TQKS0K&location=3519))

- To summarize, each price-revolution developed through five stages: slow beginnings in a period of high prosperity; a period of surge and decline; a time of discovery and institutionalization; an era of growing imbalances and increasing instability; and finally a general crisis. The climax was followed by a fall of prices, recovery of stability, and a long period of comparative price equilibrium. The social and cultural impact of these movements changed from one great wave to another. Velocity increased and variability declined. Each successive price-revolution became less catastrophic in its demographic consequences, but more sweeping in its social impact.
