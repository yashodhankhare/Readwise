- The breakthrough start-ups we have backed were all led by pattern-breaking founders who challenged conventional wisdom and convinced others to embrace a radically different future. They achieved this through a combination of pattern-breaking ideas that ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=220))

- were radically different and pattern-breaking actions that persuaded the rest of the world to think, feel, and act differently. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=222))

- I had calculated that more than 80 percent of the most impactful start-ups I’d worked with had pivoted. That is, they’d moved in a new direction that differed—often quite radically—from their starting point. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=264))

- The Lucky Fool is a key character in Nassim Taleb’s Fooled by Randomness (one of my favorite books). The lucky fool succeeds mostly due to luck, but in hindsight he ascribes the success to something else—not to good fortune, but to skill or strategy or genius or work ethic or some other factor that he tailors to fit the facts. Was I being fooled by randomness? Were the breakout founders I worked with lucky fools? Was I just a lucky fool riding their coattails? And what about the founders who didn’t achieve breakthroughs? Were they just unlucky? ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=283))

- My research revealed a counterintuitive truth: Founders don’t create outlier start-ups by mastering established recipes or best practices. Instead, they embrace pattern-breaking as a core part of their job description and start-up journey. Being extraordinarily different is a key aspect of the breakthrough founder’s job description. It’s a different type of mindset, one that demands a talent for pattern breaking, an aptitude for breaking the mold.

- ANOTHER PATTERN IN DISGUISE? Some of you must be thinking that if we analyze characteristics of breakthrough start-ups, aren’t we looking for patterns? And isn’t the book trying to propose a pattern for achieving breakthroughs? Isn’t that a contradiction? This is a thoughtful question, and to answer it, I’ll concentrate on two key distinctions. First off, I’m not saying that pattern matching is inherently “bad” or breaking patterns is always “good.” They are distinct mindsets, each with benefits and limitations. Pattern matching is a crucial cognitive skill. It helps us process information efficiently, make decisions, learn, avoid danger, and adapt. It’s vital for everyday functioning. However, these mental shortcuts can also make us miss significant anomalies right in front of us. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=351))

- Consider a Harvard experiment where students were asked to count basketball passes among players in white shirts. Amidst this, a person in a gorilla suit walked into the frame, lingering for nine seconds while jumping up and waving its arms. Would you have noticed the gorilla in the room? This question provokes a confident “Of course!” from most. Despite this, half the students didn’t notice the gorilla. This oversight, highlighted in the book The Invisible Gorilla, reveals our perceptual blind spots. It’s a clear example of how we overlook the obvious around us. To achieve a breakthrough, you’ll need a different mindset to see what you and others would normally overlook—a pattern-breaking mindset. Discovering breakthrough ideas is challenging, not because they’re hidden secrets, but because we’re conditioned to notice the familiar, while overlooking what might be. This leads to the second point: many people look for formulas for success. But the pattern-breaking mindset can’t provide a fixed recipe. There’s no set of steps guaranteeing a breakthrough; by nature, breakthroughs are undiscovered. Therefore, the concepts in Pattern Breakers are not patterns to emulate for guaranteed success. Rather, they are strategies to nurture a mindset that breaks free from conventional thinking and actions. This is different from most business methodologies you’ll encounter.

- The future doesn’t happen to us. It happens because of us. It comes to life when someone dares to supplant old ways with a different way. You will get the most out of these concepts if you embrace the viewpoint of the “unreasonable” person championed by George Bernard Shaw—the mindset of a pattern breaker. Doing so may go against your initial instincts ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=416))

- Peter and I call this understanding of the forces that propel pattern-breaking start-ups “inflection theory.” The basic idea is this: inflections and insights empower breakthrough start-ups to develop ideas that radically change how people live. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=440))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The real difference between ordinary and extraordinary start-ups is their ability to deliver pattern-breaking products that change the rules rather than simply finding gaps in markets and solutions according to the rules as they are currently defined. Inflections provide the mechanism for start-ups to defy current rules. Inflections help start-ups change the game and the conversation. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=463))

- Given the current pace of technological change, other inflections are all around us. The cyberpunk author William Gibson says it well: “The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed.” Those pockets of the future distributed unevenly among us are things with the potential to radically change how people live. You could be holding the potential for radical change in the palm of your hand. You could be standing next to it or sitting on it. Yet most people don’t recognize the transformative power of the things they’re holding or looking at or sitting on. What prevents them from recognizing the pockets of transformative potential all around them are the patterns of life that they’ve cultivated over time. The way we habitually engage with recognizable people and objects in our well-known surroundings often hinders our ability to spot new patterns. This familiarity breeds expectation, a kind of ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=488))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- inertia. It stops most of us from thinking things could change, from seeing a future where people’s thoughts, feelings, and actions are starkly different from the ways they think, feel, and act in the present.

- An insight is a nonobvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to radically change human capacities and behaviors. Many start-up ideas aren’t based on insights. Think of a founder who says, “I have an idea: a better security patch update service.” This idea isn’t based on an insight—at least not in the sense I’m using the term. This idea, even if it’s useful, doesn’t rely on an insight that harnesses one or more inflections to radically change human capacities and behavior.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- one or more inflections to effect radical change. For a breakthrough start-up, an idea grounded in an insight is the necessary next step. An idea is an attempt to conceive of some specific product or service, based on insights. This distinction, as well as the connection between ideas and insights, explains why some start-ups but not others achieve unbounded success. Some start-up ideas are based on insights; others aren’t. When an idea successfully embodies an insight into a product or service, it harnesses the power of an inflection to radically change how people live. An idea that fails to embody an insight lacks the transformative potential that inflections provide. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=518))

- Ideas can miss the mark in two ways. First, as we’ve seen, some ideas aren’t based on insights. Think again of a tool to help people manage their security patches. This idea might seem logical from the standpoint of familiar market evaluations that try to identify trends or pain points or white space, but it is not based on insights, and because of that, its potential upsides are capped. Why do technology start-ups usually need a distinct insight to maximize their potential? It boils down to how they add value compared to conventional businesses. Start-ups thrive by making rapid, massive strides in value creation, often by disrupting the norm. Instead of outperforming competitors, they redefine the game by introducing entirely new rules based on their unique insights. These insights leverage inflections to deliver transformative changes. While a start-up can achieve success without such insights, doing so is a tougher journey. Without a game-changing idea, a start-up must excel within existing competitive structures, usually gaining only temporary advantages. If competitors see a path to replicating the start-up’s idea, they typically will, using existing tactics and capabilities to challenge the new entrant. A start-up with a novel insight disorients ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=532))

- traditional competitors by changing the rules and turning the competitor’s strengths into weaknesses. The established company faces a tough choice. Should it compete with the newcomer by the rules of the new pattern—rules that nullify the incumbent’s strengths? Or should it wait, hoping the newcomer doesn’t dominate future markets and profits?

- There can be better and worse ways of embodying the power of an insight. It’s not surprising if your first product idea isn’t your best. On the contrary, it would ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=564))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- be surprising if your first idea perfectly embodies the power of the insight. It’s not surprising if your first product or service idea ends up being substantially different from the product or service you eventually offer. The distinction between ideas and insights also explains why some ideas that initially seemed unoriginal resulted in a breakthrough. However unoriginal those ideas might have seemed, they were based on real insights. Consider Google. People were using search engines before Google. But before Google, those search engines ranked search results based on keywords. They would, for instance, rank pages by how often a given search term occurred in the page. This approach made sense in theory, but in practice it had major limitations. Suppose, for instance, that I wanted people who typed the keyword “awesome” to come to my website. I could increase the chances of that happening by typing the word “awesome” on my site hundreds of times, even if it was in a color that made it invisible to people viewing it. As a result, I could increase “awesome” traffic to my website even if the viewable content on my page was completely irrelevant to the search’s intent. Google’s insight was that a page with a lot of relevant incoming links was likely more valuable to people seeking information about a given keyword. Google thus introduced a new way of ranking web pages based on the connections between them and ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=565))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the directions of those connections. It converted its insight into a powerful idea: a search engine whose results were far more relevant to searchers’ interests than those of conventional search engines. The example of Google shows how people can fail to notice something powerful when they view the world through the lens of the present or limit their assessment of an idea to just the idea, without considering the underlying powers beneath it. When viewed through a conventional lens, Google would have looked like just the latest entry in a crowded search engine market with dozens of competitors. But this assessment reflected a failure of imagination. The people who understood the importance of Google understood that the insight behind Google (PageRank) could create a breakthrough—an innovation that made the product radically superior to what had come before, not just incrementally better.

- A movement is a group of people with a shared belief in moving together toward a different future. Creating a movement starts with a provocative story that defines a larger purpose—one that extends beyond just the desire of a company to make and sell better products.

- Just as great ideas are hard to formulate, movements are hard to initiate. The incumbent institutions that dominate the present fight hard against movements—understandably. Their continued dominance—in fact, their continued existence—usually depends on maintaining the status quo. They fight to maintain it using all the powers at their disposal, including the media, lobbying, and lawsuits. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=605))

- WHAT INFLECTION THEORY DOES AND DOESN’T DO Inflection theory gives us a way of understanding why some ideas are more transformative than others and offer greater upside—in some cases, unbounded upside. It gives us a way of understanding what sets breakthrough start-ups apart from start-ups that achieve only limited success. Once we understand that inflections and insights power breakthrough ideas, and that movements propagate breakthrough changes throughout the population, the difference between a breakthrough and the normal course of either a start-up or an incumbent business starts to make sense. A number of other puzzling phenomena also start to make sense—why, for instance, some ideas that initially seem worthwhile meet with mediocre results, and why others that initially seem unworthy, even idiotic, end up as breakthroughs that radically change how people live.

- We aren’t suggesting that every pattern-breaking founder knowingly applied inflection theory to build their start-ups. People often think a theory comes first and is then applied to produce new inventions. But inventions frequently occur before the theories that can explain them. Steam engines were developed more than a century before the theory of thermodynamics was fully developed. Boomerangs, fermentation, telescopes, gunpowder, antibiotics, balloons, and alloys all were invented before scientific theories came later to explain them. Likewise, business success often precedes the theory that helps us understand its foundations. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=639))

- The cofounder and CEO of Okta, Todd McKinnon, once said to me, “Sometimes you have to believe even when you don’t believe.” Without commitment like that, founders wouldn’t be able to do their jobs. The many obstacles, doubters, and setbacks they encounter would cause them to quit. That’s why it’s doubly important to know that an idea is worth it before you go all in. Inflection theory is the best way we’ve found to test whether an idea is worth the time and sacrifice that founders need to dedicate to the job. Many founders make the mistake of trying to think of a start-up idea and then let their optimism convince them it’s an idea worth pursuing. But trying to think of a start-up idea sets founders on a path that relies on the rules of the present. It ends up moving them toward ideas with limited upside instead of opening them up to exploring a new, unbounded future.

- INFLECTION THEORY TAKEAWAYS Inflection theory holds that inflections and insights empower breakthrough start-ups to develop ideas that radically change how people live. Here are the theory’s key drivers: An inflection is an event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act. An insight is a nonobvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change human capacities and behaviors. An idea is an attempt to conceive of some specific product or service based on insights. A movement carries people forward into the future defined by a pattern-breaking start-up. Movements start with the few. They are initially dismissed by most, but eventually the start-up’s idea is embraced as a widely accepted truth. We’ll devote the rest of the book to exploring these concepts, beginning with the first and most foundational of them: inflections.

Our perspective of inflections is very similar to Grove’s, albeit approached differently. Grove viewed strategic inflections as major threats due to their potential to disrupt the industry’s established norms. Companies that failed to identify and adapt to these changes risked becoming irrelevant. The challenge for dominant companies was avoiding complacency and swiftly responding to these shifts. Grove stressed the need for vigilance and adaptability, even suggesting a hint of “paranoia” for continued success… ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=702))

- we work with start-ups—and enjoy it, because they make something out of nothing. They change the future, which means they upend the status quo. From our vantage point, inflections—such as a change in the power of a technology, a change in people’s attitudes, a change in regulations—are the underlying force that start-ups can exploit to radically alter how people think, feel, and act and thus create a radically different future. Consider Lyft and its archrival Uber. Both capitalized on two powerful inflections: the advent of GPS-enabled smartphones that could track location for free, and Facebook Connect, which enabled websites and smartphone apps to incorporate Facebook’s profile information, allowing other users to see it. Uber and Lyft exploited these new forms of empowerment in a way that radically changed how people traveled. An inflection is a type of event—a change. But it’s not just any change. It’s an underlying change that makes an even greater change possible, one that adds to the inventory of what humans can do. In this way, livestreaming, tweeting, web surfing, and ridesharing all harnessed the power of inflections. None of these activities were… ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=716))

- While we respect the role of societal and regulatory inflections, it’s still technology that dominates the reshaping of human capabilities. Things surrounding us daily might not scream “tech.” But dig a bit, and you’ll see that technology likely pushed them forward at the start. Take something simple, like the cereal you eat for breakfast. In the late nineteenth century, when John and Will Kellogg invented a cereal that had a long shelf life, it was a major technology breakthrough. Most significant progress, from conjuring fire out of the darkness in ancient times to the use of movable type in the Middle Ages to tapping into artificial intelligence today, comes from mastering and applying new technologies. This is why Peter and I prioritize technology inflections as a necessary ingredient when evaluating new start-up ideas.

- new thing marks an inflection, and neither does every widespread societal change. Consider fads or crazes. They’re not inflections even if they’re widespread, because they don’t radically expand human abilities.

- A start-up’s advantage, by contrast, depends on redefining people’s patterns of behavior—on replacing established patterns with new ones. As creatures of habit, humans get entrenched in ways that gain inertia over time. Overcoming that inertia takes something powerful—an inflection. That means inflections are the start-up’s most important opportunity to make a major impact. Why do so many start-ups fail to harness the power of inflections to radically change the future? Why do they miss the wave? The answer is that many start-up founders begin by looking for trends in the here and now, or for big markets with white space and pain points. As a result, they fail to discover inflections that can help them transcend the status quo. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=839))

- As a technology improves at a faster rate, it tends to lead to major advancements more frequently. Rapid progress up the technology curve means big changes happen more often and more quickly. For example, between 2009 and 2019, the cost to produce electricity from solar panels dropped by 89 percent. This means performance doubled roughly every 38 months and saw a tenfold increase about every 126 months. Consider again Moore’s Law: performance of microprocessors doubles every twenty-four months and multiplies tenfold around every eighty months.

Genome sequencing is advancing even faster, with performance doubling almost every eleven months and growing tenfold approximately every thirty-seven months.

- THE INFLECTIONS STRESS TEST When I meet founders, they usually have an idea in mind. As you might suspect, I often ask whether their idea taps into one or more inflections. More specifically, I try to determine: Have they connected a specific and powerful change from the outside world to the opportunity to empower people with something they never imagined possible? Who are the people this capability would empower, and why would they desperately want the new capabilities? Under what circumstances might the inflection significantly change people’s lives, and when might it not be impactful enough? Table 2.4 offers a simple stress test for these three components. Table 2.4 Inflections Stress Test Inflection Inflection description The new thing The specific new thing introduced What it enables Why it’s powerful The magnitude of the empowerment The people who are affected by the new empowerment Conditions for success Factors outside the start-up’s control that can help the inflection achieve its full potential ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=911))

- For founders who are in search of an idea, starting with inflections—rather than trying to think of a start-up—will increase their chances of landing on an idea with the potential to create radical change. In Table 2.5, we apply the stress-test method to one of the inflections that powered Lyft and, for that matter, Uber: the advent of GPS-enabled smartphones that could track drivers’ and riders’ locations for free. Notice how this example of the GPS smartphone offers specific detail about the components of an inflection. It describes in a concise way the inflection along with what it enables. It also describes the specific way the inflection empowers people and the relevant set of people who could be empowered. Finally, it outlines the conditions for success—a concept that merits further elaboration. Founders harnessing inflections are placing bets on whether their chosen inflections can radically change the future. But the future hasn’t happened yet, and it’s highly uncertain. This requires us to embrace a mindset of “thinking in bets,” which involves carefully evaluating the conditions that could make an inflection transformative, as well as recognizing situations in which it may not make a substantial difference.

Over the past fifty years, regulatory hurdles, public opinion, political factions, and other issues have prevented its empowering conditions from being fully met. Under the right circumstances, though, regulations can change—even producing an inflection of their own. A good example is the new telehealth regulations introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Table 2.6 for an example of an inflections stress test for telemedicine.

- Of the numerous risks you face, timing is perhaps the biggest, and it is fraught with the most uncertainty. Here’s just one example: Ironically, many of the ideas that formed the foundation of the iPhone were tried over a decade earlier at a company called General Magic, which was staffed with some of Apple’s earliest and most prominent technical leaders. But the technology wasn’t yet ready to enable the right capabilities at the right price to achieve the type of revolutionary success the iPhone enjoyed. In another ironic twist, many people from General Magic came back to Apple, ready for the right moment for the iPhone to become a phenomenal success. Conventional thinkers often maintain that if something was tried in the past and didn’t work, ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1002))

- then it’s already been “proven” not to work. This betrays a lack of understanding of how inflections drive change. It has never been easier to start a company or launch a new product or service. The world of start-ups is efficient at letting every idea get tried. The key question to ask isn’t whether an idea has been tried before; it probably has. The important question is: Why is now the time it’s going to work? What inflection has emerged that makes this time different? Quite often the team that finally gets the timing of an idea right isn’t even aware that it’s been tried before and failed—and that’s to their advantage. You can think of it this way: Every breakthrough will happen. The question is when, not if. When a venture capitalist responds to your pitch by asking, “Why now?” they’re really asking, “What inflections does your idea harness? And why is now the time to harness them?” ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1008))

- GOOD IDEAS, BAD IDEAS—AND BREAKTHROUGHS An inflections stress test can help a founder weed out some of the most dangerous ideas of all: plausibly good ideas that aren’t driven by any sort of inflection. Because these ideas sound plausible, most people you talk to about them will think they make sense and should be launched. The false positive of that feedback can reinforce your own intuition and lead you to devote years of your life to an idea with limited upside. As an example, I’ve often been pitched on ideas related to mental health. The founder will say we’re in a mental health crisis, it’s gotten worse with the pandemic or Instagram, it’s having a huge negative impact on society, and we’ve got to do something about it. I agree! A new idea to better address mental health will generate a lot of positive feedback. People have personal experiences that will help them relate to the idea. They may get very positive encouragement from investors, advisers, and others touched by a mental health crisis. Despite the encouragement, the idea needs to be supported by an inflection that offers a set of empowering capabilities to change the future of mental health.

- How could an idea as dumb as Justin.tv end up transforming entertainment? The answer has a lot to do with inflections. Video streaming had started working at scale with YouTube beginning in 2005, and by 2007 broadband penetration had become extremely high. Those inflections were obvious by the time I met Justin. The key question to ask in evaluating Justin.tv wasn’t whether anyone would watch his life all day and all night. It was whether content delivery networks had reached an inflection point that would enable livestreaming. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1097))

- Justin.tv launched as nothing more than a twenty-four/seven livestream of Justin’s daily activities. Its novelty didn’t attract much attention. But not long after I invested, the team made their first pivot. They dropped the Justin reality show and relaunched as a platform, segmented by channels, where anyone could broadcast their own live videos. The pivot created a new set of issues because people started streaming copyrighted live content, such as sporting events. (This development landed another Justin.tv cofounder, Michael Seibel, in front of a congressional committee, whose members were not too happy about this use.) The founders pushed their way to profitability by running ads, but they weren’t doing anything they thought was destined to truly matter. It felt like they were wasting their time. The inflections were real, but something was still missing. Another Justin.tv cofounder, Emmett Shear, began losing faith. He dialed back for a couple months, didn’t work as hard, hung out with friends, and played video games. Paradoxically, the act of letting go ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1109))

- opened his mind and brought him closer to a breakthrough idea. Emmett asked himself a simple question: How do I actually use our own platform? The answer was also simple: he liked watching skilled people play video games. He wasn’t alone. About 2 percent of users did the same—and it was a passionate 2 percent. Emmett did some digging. He asked about forty gamers why they livestreamed themselves in action and what could make the experience better. It seemed like a small opportunity, but one worth exploring, so Emmett and his team created more appealing features for gamers to stream as well as a way for them to make money off their streams. More people began coming to the site. “It started feeling more like you were chasing a boulder down a hill than you were pushing a boulder up a hill,” Emmett later said. “We really started getting this sense of pull, where the market was pulling us along.” Twitch.tv was officially launched as a separate entity from Justin.tv in June 2011. It featured video game livestreaming, esports competitions, personal player streams, and gaming talk shows. Today, Spencer, my gaming and media-savvy son, still considers Twitch the best idea I ever supported. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1117))

- MORE INFLECTION TAKEAWAYS As we dive further into inflections, here are four additional points to keep in mind: Be careful about ideas that sound good but are not grounded in powerful inflections. An inflection is the asymmetric weapon that powers a breakthrough, creating a different future. Don’t settle. If your idea is not grounded in a powerful inflection, that is a warning sign to think more deeply about what makes the idea powerful, or to question whether it is sufficiently powerful to be worthy of your time and sacrifice. Do not rush to reject ideas that sound crazy at first; they may be great ideas that tap into powerful inflections. We will talk more about pivots in future chapters, but it’s important to remember that powerful inflections at the core of an idea retain their power, even if the ideas themselves change. Given a choice, I would prefer to start with a seemingly bad or ambiguous idea powered by strong inflections than a plausibly good or seemingly straightforward idea where I can’t identify an underlying set of inflections that are powerful enough to create radical change. The first option is still risky, but it usually has better odds of success and certainly better odds of achieving outlier success.

- Be skeptical when someone says it’s been tried before and didn’t work. Over twenty-three thousand start-ups raised seed funding from 2016 to 2020, a sevenfold increase from the prior decade. Chances are, someone has already explored any idea you come up with. Yet whether your idea has been tried isn’t what really matters. The more important question is why is now the time for the idea to work, as opposed to the past. If you can point to a specific inflection that makes it different this time, you might be on to an important insight that others dismiss when they fail to evaluate your idea beneath the surface. For example, a lot of people thought Instacart could not work because Webvan had been a flameout just a decade earlier. Stress-test your ideas by considering their underlying inflections in sufficient detail. Thinking about inflections in depth leads you to consider a series of critical questions. What is the specific new thing that has happened? How does it empower people, and whom does it have the potential to empower now and in the future? And under what conditions might your idea be too early, too late, or just right? For all their power, though, inflections aren’t enough to produce radical change by themselves.

- Insights are important because the presence of a powerful new technology doesn’t guarantee that it will be used to maximum effect. Consider the wheel, which existed for hundreds of years before it was used for transportation. For all those centuries, people simply mounted wheels horizontally to streamline pottery making. Let’s give the Mesopotamians their due. After all, before the pottery wheel, pots were made from strands of clay that were rolled into long threads and manually coiled. The use of the wheel for pottery was therefore an insight as well. But for the wheel to realize its potential as we understand it today, someone needed to have a second insight: that the wheel could also be mounted vertically to enable transportation. The example of the wheel shows that just because you have a power doesn’t mean you know you have it or know how to use it. This is what makes some inflections so interesting, especially from a business perspective. Most people don’t know that new powers are now available for them to harness. They don’t recognize that a new thing has appeared in their environment that empowers them to do things they’ve never done before. As a result, they continue with business as usual, unaware that the power to create radical change is there for the taking. Some founders have the insight to see these powers and harness them to create radical change. The insight behind Uber and Lyft was that it is possible to apply the sharing economy to cars. Just as Airbnb had allowed people to share an extra room in their houses, ridesharing start-ups like Uber and Lyft proposed to let people share an extra seat in their cars. It was possible, in other words, to radically change how people traveled from one place to another through an app that harnessed the power of GPS-enabled smartphones together with people’s willingness to share their location.

- Inflections, as we explained in the previous chapter, aren’t caused by start-ups; rather, they are external events. Insights are different. They come from the minds of start-up founders who see what others don’t yet see. So, then, why are insights so crucial to breakthroughs? Andy Rachleff, cofounder of leading venture capital firm Benchmark and CEO of Wealthfront, offers my favorite explanation. Rachleff applied a brilliant investment theory from prominent investor and writer Howard Marks to the world of entrepreneurship. Start-up ideas can be placed in a two-by-two matrix, as illustrated in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1 An insight must be non-consensus and right to have pattern-breaking potential.

- Being non-consensus and right is the path with the highest odds of achieving a breakthrough. But it’s an emotionally harder path to follow. It requires you to break free from the herd and resist the temptation to imitate others. Because your insight is non-consensus, it requires you to acknowledge that most people won’t like your insight at first. After all, if too many people like it right away, it’s too similar to what they already believe, which makes it unlikely that your insight is different enough—or even an insight at all. Being non-consensus and right provides many more benefits: it lets the start-up compete based on being different, rather than being better. Think about it. If an incumbent… ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1322))

- The power of different favors the start-up because it forces a choice and not a comparison. Suppose incumbent companies sell apples. As a breakthrough start-up, you don’t want to offer a five-times-better apple. You would be better off saying, “I have an entirely new thing: the world’s first and only banana.” Not everyone will want your bananas. But 100 percent of the people who do want them will only be able to get them from you. This example may seem overly simplistic, so let’s consider real examples of technology breakthroughs. When Apple introduced the iPhone, people didn’t ask, “How does that compare to the BlackBerry?” When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, people didn’t ask, “How does that compare to Google Search?” And when Tesla introduced the Model S, people didn’t ask, “How does that compare to a Mercedes?” All… ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1332))

- Being non-consensus affords extra protection from the hostile elements in a world where people don’t yet really care what you are doing. If they’re aware of your start-up at all, most think it’s unimportant because they haven’t discovered the power of your insight to effect radical change. The role of insights has clarified for me why some start-ups with great-sounding ideas or solid execution can still fail while others achieve breakthrough success despite many apparent missteps. For unconventional success, start-ups need to create something unique that people are desperate for. Together, inflections and insights are mutual multipliers—inflections create the conditions for radical empowerment, and insights create the conditions for radical differentiation. When it comes to start-ups, better doesn’t matter.

- When you intertwine potent technological advancements with groundbreaking insights about how to harness them, the outcome is often transformative products that redefine industries.

- Start-ups, as we’ve emphasized, need an unfair advantage because incumbents benefit from people’s established patterns of behavior. A start-up’s advantage, by contrast, depends on breaking people’s patterns of behavior—on replacing established patterns with new ones. The first weapon a start-up needs, then, is an inflection that exists external to any business but creates the initial conditions for radical change. Subsequently, insights are internal. They convert the opportunities posed by inflections into a potential breakthrough that impacts people in a way that radically alters the future.

- Why do so many fail to get there? A key reason is that many start-up founders begin by looking for underserved markets and unmet customer needs. They then feel compelled to immediately create a product that meets market demands and customer needs in the here and now. But, in doing so, founders frequently skip the crucial step of determining if their idea embodies an inflection and an insight. As a result, they come up with an idea that does not offer compelling enough value (because it lacks an inflection with sufficient empowering capabilities) or enough differentiation (because it does not rely on a unique insight). As a result, they often miss out on the opportunity to pursue an idea with pattern-breaking potential. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1374))

It is true that many customers are interested in an AI co-pilot for the products they use everyday. For instance, an AI co-pilot interface for Microsoft Excel might be very valuable for users, but it’s not an insight because Microsoft is already highly likely to implement such a feature.

- the future differs from the present, the more radically it departs from the ways people currently live, and therefore the less obvious the truths about that future are likely to be. Product ideas based on obvious truths have either a limited upside or a high likelihood of failure. Consider the example of the AI co-pilot for Microsoft Excel. Because this is obvious, it’s already well known by established incumbents. They have far more resources to devote to solving the problem than a start-up, and they actually ship the products that contain the capabilities. If a start-up tries to compete, it’s likely to lose—unless its founders have an insight that yields a new pattern of behavior rather than a “better mousetrap” that leads to incremental improvement.

Gimmicky or meme-worthy ideas that are trendy but that don’t result in a sustainable change in how people think, feel, and act don’t count as insights as we think of them. A good example is the company Groupon, whose name is a combination of the words “group” and “coupon.” It provides daily discounts on local goods, services, and experiences. From half-priced massages and resort stays to deals on classes, medical services, and local attractions, Groupon taps into a wide spectrum of offerings. Groupon catapulted into the spotlight, boldly rejecting a $6 billion acquisition offer from Google and going public soon after in 2011 with a $17.8 billion valuation. Yet over the past ten years, its fortunes have seen an equally steep decline. By early 2023, its value had tumbled to $103 million, a staggering drop from its initial public… ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1426))

Ultimately, instead of solidifying as a behavior shift for consumers and businesses, Groupon’s model faded due to oversaturation and unmet promises. A pattern-breaking idea must transcend fleeting attention. It should offer a transformative empowerment that stands the test of time, replacing existing norms. At its core, this requires an insight about how to harness inflections that have the potential to create a valuable and sustainable new form of empowerment that’s durable and lasts beyond the initial novelty.

Brian drew on another distinct advantage that shaped his viewpoint: he was among the first of a generation of digital-native leaders. Those born before the early 1980s, including Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, can be thought of as “analog natives.” For them, technology was a layer added to their daily existence, with computers seen as tools augmenting their real-world interactions. Analog natives today represent roughly 136.8 million Americans. Conversely, digital natives, spanning younger Gen Xers to Millennials, grew up immersed in technology.

- INSIGHTS AND TIMING Timing, as we saw earlier in the chapter on inflections, is an important determinant in the potential to create a breakthrough. Insights take this a step further. The most powerful insights harness inflections that have already been established and combine them with inflections that are new to create something radically different. In the case of Airbnb, ratings and reviews were already gaining traction as a mainstream way for people to build trust online, beginning with sites like eBay and Amazon. And Facebook Connect provided the enabling technology to facilitate new levels of trust that overcame the concern people had about staying in a stranger’s home. In the case of Lyft, Airbnb had shown that Facebook Connect could be leveraged to create trust among strangers, but the iPhone 4s provided the enabling technology to complement this with the ability for riders and drivers to locate each other accurately and in real time. In both cases, the founders had to grasp the implications of the new inflections and how to harness them to create a nonobvious insight about the future that had become imminently possible. Which of today’s developments capture my interest the most? How could they connect to insights into what’s coming next? Improvements in deep learning, big data, hardware acceleration, cloud computing, transformers, and large language models have converged in a perfect storm for a massive AI platform shift, paving the way for remarkable new products. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has exploded, gaining a hundred million users in two months. AI will change virtually everything that matters in the private and public sectors. It will soon reshape policies, ethics, and the very fabric of society. Climate change has been a discussion topic for decades, but we see a shift in thinking as an ever-increasing number of people have witnessed the effects firsthand with raging fires and more frequent flooding.

How could such an insight enable some to have the impact that past upstarts Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook once had? Merely sharing the excitement that many others feel isn’t sufficient. For start-ups seeking exceptional success, discovering a unique insight will be essential. If you have one, you now know whom to stress-test it with!

- INSIGHT FAILURE MODES One common pitfall is to conflate the belief that your idea is missing from the world with the belief that you’ve discovered an insight. The improved security patch management idea, while perhaps better at addressing a potential customer need than what exists today, isn’t powered by a fundamental insight. Customers wanting to better manage their security patches is an idea for an improved product rather than an insight about the future.

- Failure also takes place when a perceived insight about the future is wrong. This might seem like a rookie mistake, but it happens frequently. I have a great deal of sympathy because consensus ideas are easy to validate quickly. Non-consensus ideas, on the other hand, are harder to prove right away, by their very nature. The challenge of pattern-breaking entrepreneurship is that in the beginning, you don’t truly know if you are non-consensus and right. Most often you find out first that you are non-consensus, and then only later, after taking the upfront risk that you might be wrong, do you validate that you are right. In my view, it’s still better to risk failure on this dimension than to cap your upside from day one by pursuing something that’s consensus.

- that you should. The genuine quest is for enduring truth rather than fleeting affirmation. Often, the popular consensus gravitates toward notions that, even if valid, offer restricted upside because what seems like an initial advantage can get arbitraged away by excessive competition. A third failure mode is to pursue an insight that the status quo has the power to defeat, often unfairly or with nonmarket forces. I experienced this pain firsthand with an ambitious start-up I was involved with called Outbox Mail. Outbox Mail sought to transform postal mail delivery by turning physical mail into a digital format for online viewing. Their method, however, ran into regulatory hurdles, especially from the US Postal Service (USPS).

The postal service’s refusal to cooperate rendered Outbox’s business model unviable, leading to its closure.

The path to greatness is to be both non-consensus and right about an opportunity to change how people will think, feel, and act in the future. Powerful insights leverage the power of inflections. You don’t want to be contrarian for its own sake. Your insight needs to be based on inflections rather than on a clever tagline. You could mistake “Betcha can’t eat just one” for an insight that worked for Lay’s potato chips, but it is not based on powerful inflections. Discovering a meaningful insight is not only about being clever; the insight that drives a breakthrough needs to have substance.

- we take for granted today were once considered heresy in their time. When Galileo endorsed Copernicus’s insight that planets revolve around the sun in a heliocentric model, thus challenging the accepted belief that they revolved around the earth in a geocentric model, he was put on trial by the Roman Catholic church in 1633. He was found “vehemently suspect of heresy” and was forced to recant his views. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It wasn’t until 1822, almost two centuries later, that the Catholic church formally lifted its ban on books promoting heliocentrism. Ignaz Semmelweis proposed that handwashing could drastically reduce the incidence of fever and death in hospitals. He was met with skepticism and ridicule by the medical community. While he wasn’t threatened with violence directly, his life ended tragically in a mental institution. Charles Darwin hesitated to publish his theory of natural selection. He recognized the religious implications and how his ideas challenged prevailing beliefs about creation. He feared backlash from religious circles. Professionally and socially, he was concerned about the reactions of peers, friends, and family. His discovery that Alfred Russel Wallace had similar ideas spurred him to publish, and in 1859 Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was released. Not surprisingly, it ignited significant debate and controversy on the way to laying the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. So much around us that we accept as given today came from insights that were considered heresy in their time. But it turns out that, regardless of your field, to achieve a massive breakthrough you must be willing to depart from conventional wisdom. This is counterintuitive behavior; it goes against what we learn growing up. We are rewarded with better grades when we give known answers to questions that have already been discovered. We get rewarded with better health if we work out more hours in the gym. Most things we do are rewarded when we produce more of something. But breakthroughs are different from conventional or incremental success. They require you to think and act differently.

These patterns prevent most people, including potential founders, from recognizing inflections and the potential for radically different futures. Living in the future enables you to emerge with insights—the second essential element of inflection theory—into how the new things you’re interacting with can lead to a powerful and nonobvious insight that will make a significant difference for people in the future.

- Marc Andreessen and Bob Metcalfe each found their way to a breakthrough insight by solving a problem for themselves. They created a solution to a challenge they were already experiencing while living in the future. There’s a certain magic in crafting something with your own hands, for your own needs. As Paul Graham, the cofounder of Y Combinator, eloquently put it, “Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake start-ups make is to solve problems no one has.” Why would so many people make such an obvious mistake? It’s because we often fall in love with our idea of the solution we want to build before falling in love with a problem that we experience while living in the future. “Falling in love with a solution” highlights the danger that founders, creators, or teams can become so enamored with their particular product or service—their “solution”—that they overlook whether it actually solves a real problem for their customers. This can lead to developing products that are technically impressive or aesthetically pleasing, but that don’t resonate with users because they don’t solve a significant problem or improve people’s lives in a meaningful way.

Pattern-breaking ideas are less about conjuring up the next big thing for tomorrow and more about genuinely understanding tomorrow’s problems before others are exposed to them. But what if you’re not fortunate enough to be hanging out in a supercomputer lab or some other time machine at exactly the right moment? What if you don’t yet have an insight that meets your own burning desire to solve your own problem? ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1768))

- The bet she placed on that future became the insight that led to Living Carbon. Most people live in the present, but not everyone. Yes, it is possible to come up with a breakthrough insight by living in the present, but the odds are dramatically worse. If you’re like most founders we work with, you’d rather improve your odds wherever possible! The idea of living in the future as opposed to living in the present strikes some as a semantic difference rather than a concrete notion. Isn’t the very act of creating any start-up an effort to live in the future, by definition? Aren’t start-up founders envisioning a different tomorrow? You might be inclined to agree, and I can see where you are coming from. But hear me out for a bit because there’s an important nuance that’s easy to miss. Let’s take a closer look at the difference between living in the present and living in the future. Deciding where you “live” is a choice that most founders don’t even realize they are making. Should I build my start-up based on the assumption that the future will be a continuation of the present, following similar patterns and rules? Or do I build for a future that I believe will be radically discontinuous, where ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1866))

- the norms and assumptions of today shift dramatically? When founders build for a future that’s an extension of today, they are living in the present, building on present-day norms of thinking, feeling, and acting that have been previously set by others. They focus on creating a better future—an improved version of the present. Living in the present is enticing because the route to success is more straightforward and recognizable. Your cofounders, investors, and advisors will be less likely to push back on your ideas. But in this clarity and comfort lies a trap, because following existing rules inherently constrains your potential to achieve outsized impact. The pattern breaker seeks to build for a future that will break from what we know today. They are living in the future. They reject the path of refining what already exists. They focus on creating a radically different future and commit to discovering inflections and insights that enable them to deliver a pattern-breaking solution. Living in the future is not for everyone; very few have the inner confidence to take that path. You’re piecing together a path forward without a clear map to guide you. However, it’s precisely this absence of preset landmarks and limits that offers enormous potential. You’re not confined by the boundaries established by others; instead, you have the freedom to create new boundaries.

- Whether one lives in the present or the future starts with having the right mindset, but it also comes from hands-on work with technology inflections that can create the necessary shifts. Immersion in technology inflections—while also teaming up with the right collaborators, who have their eyes on the same point on the horizon—amplifies your abilities to see the new patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting that will come with the changes ahead. As described earlier, at the start of commercial use of the internet, people living in the present believed that the digital superhighway would be built and defined by the old guard—the phone and cable companies, the tech giants, or the state. People from that world believed that the world of tomorrow would extend out from current patterns. For instance, Microsoft believed they had to construct a superior walled garden, one that outdid AOL’s, and link it closely with their Windows operating system. Microsoft management took their cues by listening to the needs of Windows users, and why not? These were the people whose problems Microsoft cared the most to solve.

The Mosaic team decided what to build by directly observing the obstacles they faced while trying to unlock the full potential of the new capabilities. They were getting feedback from like-minded early internet users, who were also living in the future and exploring this uncharted territory. The team created a solution that was radically different from the walled gardens favored by those living in the present; they decided that their approach should not be constrained by top-down thinking—it should be more like a web. The difference can be simply described by looking at the starting point. If you are living in the present, your starting point is the present and you extrapolate into the future. If your starting point is living in the future, you can’t extrapolate from the present. People living in the future have a better vantage point to develop an insight earlier; those in the present will be playing catch-up. People living in the present build solutions for problems in the present.

Most people can’t see the potential of a new technology because they’re limited by their preexisting ideas of how things work. Their established patterns of life limit their imaginations. They’re too stuck in the mode of thinking about how things are to understand how things could be. Ironically, most people’s limiting beliefs are self-imposed. They block themselves from having insights about the future. Pattern-breaking founders, by contrast, break free of conventional ways. They’re able to see things that most people can’t—a world without the limitations of the present. Their liberation enables them to grasp the potential for change that a new technology introduces. That’s what enables them to gain an insight about how things could be. By living in the present you might have a vague general sense that there must be inflections all around. But you wouldn’t know exactly where they are and what the empowering technologies are.

They often aren’t as transactional as most businesspeople, and their primary motivation is not where the biggest profits will come from or how to make the most money off the new trend. They’re more interested in the ideas themselves. Why? The transactional is characteristic of the mundane present that these people have been trying to escape. The transactional kills the joy of exploring ideas. People like these are more interested in whether you can add to the ideas they care about.

- LIVING IN THE FUTURE TAKEAWAYS Don’t think of a start-up. When you think of a start-up, you can get trapped by the limitations imposed by the established patterns of thinking shared by people living in the present. These patterns can prevent you from interacting with the powerful possibilities that inflections introduce. Interacting with possibilities is what leads you to the insights that beget breakthrough ideas, and it’s those insights that have the power to create radically different futures. Your advisers—and your own instincts—may suggest that going straight to thinking of a start-up is the shortest path to a breakthrough. We see it differently. The best path to breakthrough start-up insights is to live in the future and notice what is missing there. Living in the future is the best way to stack the deck in your favor to achieve a breakthrough idea. You live in the future by directly interacting with the cutting edge of new technologies and by thinking about how to unlock their potential to create radically different futures. As you live in the future, you will encounter barriers to getting the most out of the technologies you interact with, which will inform your intuition about the most important things missing. This intuition is far more likely to be right in guiding you to a powerful non-consensus insight. There are lots of ways to live in the future. Be creative about how to get there. Many paths exist. Not being intentional about living in the future is a huge missed opportunity. You can act in ways that increase your chances of finding a breakthrough insight. You can fine-tune your powers of observation by paying closer attention to the world around you and looking for patterns or connections that most people would not bother to consider. You can consistently and regularly read about a wide range of topics, learn new skills, and gather information from various sources to help stimulate creative thinking. Through play and experimentation, you can learn in great depth about new ideas, materials, and techniques that can lead you to a breakthrough discovery. And you can pay careful attention to your emotional and personal experiences, reflecting on your own feelings to generate inspiration. Living in the future helps prepare your mind. And a prepared mind is much more likely to notice inflections and develop insights about the profound changes they make possible. That’s why living in the future increases your chances of breaking out of the consensus trap. Ultimately, though, you must be both non-consensus and right. How can you ever be sure? That’s the topic we will turn to next. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=1993))

Using stress tests to validate your inflections and insights gets your start-up on the runway—but we’re not yet cleared for takeoff. We need an additional stress test: the implementation stress test. You are on the right path when your idea embodies a powerful inflection and you have a unique insight. But to deliver a product that breaks patterns and changes how people will think, feel, and act in the future, you need to identify the specific people who desperately want you to implement a specific solution. The implementation stress test helps you by creating a prototype with simulated features tailored to resonate strongly with a select group of early adopters.

College textbooks were expensive. A 25 percent savings was meaningful to many students. Consider what Chegg learned from the Textbookflix implementation prototype. They could show prospective investors the willingness of college students to pay different rental prices in the real world. When you looked at the price students were willing to pay to rent textbooks on such a terribly presented site, it was obvious that there would be extraordinary demand for such a service. Given the enthusiastic response from the implementation prototype, the founders were able to convince investors to provide the money they needed to deliver a real product as soon as possible. The Chegg team immediately shifted gears and started to build their minimum viable product with extraordinary urgency. It was an immediate hit with students, and the company’s growth was nothing short of meteoric. In just five short years after testing the Textbookflix prototype, Chegg was moving an astonishing $200 million in textbooks. That was in 2012.

These concept cars aren’t built for the road or safety tested. Rather than presenting a production-ready car for early customers, automakers have a different objective with concept cars.

- platforms, using landing pages might be an efficient way to test demand. These pages allow for quick feedback. But quite often, something this basic isn’t enough. Physical items, especially those reliant on sensory experiences like touch or taste, resist such a virtual test. When users face significant time or financial commitments, a webpage usually won’t capture their interest with enough fidelity. Car manufacturers create concept cars to genuinely understand the reaction from car buyers and dealers. It’s not just about viewing a car or hearing about it; it’s about experiencing it. Making prototypes of cars that look real is costly, but it’s essential for automakers to tease out whether customers are truly desperate for them to build the car. Pattern-breaking founders master this balance. The goal when crafting an implementation prototype is to strike a balance between the effort put into the simulation and the kind of concrete feedback needed to gauge if your idea resonates strongly with potential early believers. Take Lyft as an example. Simple online ads or landing pages weren’t enough to gauge rider and driver reactions.… ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2125))

Now we use the phrase to mean a choice you can’t undo, a final commitment. From what I’ve observed, once start-up founders raise money and set about building a minimum viable product, they mentally and emotionally reach a point of no return. It’s not helpful for them to learn after the fact that the forces underlying their start-up idea are not powerful enough to realize a big-enough upside. They are already fully committed. Many jump too quickly to raise funding before confirming the power of their insight and identifying an initial set of passionate early believers. Having obtained the money, they hire developers, rent their first office space, and start developing a minimum viable product. And why not, since this is the standard recipe?

- When I heard him say this, it connected a bunch of disparate dots in my mind, yielding a new level of understanding about the value of surprises for the start-up process. Surprises are so important to understand because you are pursuing a non-consensus idea for a future that is mostly unknown or at least ambiguous. You want to create a breakthrough product that people haven’t seen before, not just an incremental improvement. Scott’s comment helped me see that breakthroughs are a discovery of something new by definition—and that means they must have an element of surprise when they are encountered.

- IMPLEMENTATION PROTOTYPES: YOUR TOOL TO UNCOVER SURPRISES Engaging potential early customers with an implementation prototype previews your insight about the future to those who you hope are most desperate to benefit from it. Your insight about the future is hopefully spot-on. If your interactions with potential early customers cause you to conclude that the insight is false, you are far better off moving on rather than raising money, hiring a team, and investing your time and energy in a venture that’s likely doomed. Even if your insight is accurate, you’re navigating a highly unpredictable terrain when interacting with early customers. Pitching an early prototype to potential customers is akin to laying out a map of what you believe the future holds. Sometimes that map leads to a treasure; at other times you can get feedback that suggests you’re lost or have deviated from the right path. However, if your compass—your insight—points true, you receive guidance as to the general direction you need to head. Since you are traveling through unexplored territory, you should expect course corrections along the ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2235))

- way. That’s why not only should you expect surprises; you should savor them. In the Okta example, feedback on the initial implementation prototype was tepid—a negative surprise. But by staying open to unforeseen feedback, Todd and Freddy pinpointed where the actual desperation lay, and they leaned into it when they iterated. Sometimes, as with Chegg and Textbookflix, you find that your customers value your idea more than you might have guessed—a positive surprise. Chegg hoped students might spend at least $35 to rent a textbook rather than buy a new one for $100. The willingness of some students to pay up to $75 to rent a $100 textbook was a surprise. Looking back, anything less than $100 was an expense reduction, and for cash-strapped college students, even a small amount of extra money mattered. Chegg’s story shows it is important to keep your mind open to positive surprises from early… ([Location 2244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2244))

- questions like “How much will a student pay?” than looking for a yes-or-no answer to “Will they pay $35?” Both cases illustrate the profound importance of savoring surprises. The idea of savoring surprises might seem obvious. Yet time and again, I’ve seen founders struggle to do it. Rather than venturing into the unknown with an eye toward noticing the unexpected, they approach early customers with a confirmation bias, aiming to validate their established hypotheses. It’s not enlightenment they’re primarily after, but affirmation. They hope for that reassuring nod, the “I knew it!” moment when their beliefs are echoed back to them. Yet they overlook the fact that each interaction with an early customer isn’t just feedback—it’s a chance to uncover a nugget of unforeseen wisdom. When founders overemphasize validation, they unintentionally shut… ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2253))

- concept based on these surprising discoveries. If your insight is correct, you should be able to find specific people who are desperate for you to build a product implementing that insight. But as you explore whether this is indeed the case, there are two important variables for you to consider: Is this the best way to implement my insight? Am I talking to the right people? When you encounter a negative surprise, it might be because you are implementing your insight wrong. But it might also be because you are talking to the wrong people, those who won’t care about your insight no matter what you implement. Keep in mind, if your idea is non-consensus, it follows that most people will dislike it—even if you are right. In the early days, people thought eBay… ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2262))

- stranger’s car? Or believe in a company like SpaceX that would launch reusable rockets into outer space? Most “normal” people dislike even the most powerful and correct insights about the future because a true insight forces people to change their point of view in a way that can make them uncomfortable. Human beings are conditioned to favor the familiar. Paradoxically, that means if most people like your insight, it’s probably not an insight at all. It’s probably too similar to what they already know and like, which makes it more consensus than non-consensus. This is why it’s important to keep asking, “Am I talking to the right people?” in addition to “Is my implementation off target?” whenever you get negative feedback on your prototype. The Okta example from the previous chapter illustrates this well. In the first iteration of their Balsamiq prototype, the founders were talking to the right people (early adopters of cloud computing and Salesforce) but showing the wrong initial implementation of their insight. It didn’t land. So they kept listening to the right ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2271))

- people, who gave them feedback about what they should build to best implement their insight. Positive surprises are even more valuable. When you encounter a positive surprise, the key is to deeply understand “what went right” and lean into it aggressively. Start-up founders sometimes assume they should address objections as they iterate in their prototypes, but the real goal is to identify positive surprises and double down on iterations that reinforce them. This is an important distinction. The reason positive surprises matter most is they reveal desperation, which opens the door to success. Negative surprises are useful in determining that you haven’t unlocked desperation, but they should not be looked at as objections you need to overcome. Instead, they should push you to iterate to seek positive surprises by modifying your implementation, modifying your audience, or a combination of both. Positive surprises suggest that you are getting warmer in your understanding of these two variables, which is why you want to pursue them aggressively.

- SURPRISES ARE MORE VALUABLE THAN VALIDATION Positive surprises are awesome. They show that your idea might be right and non-consensus. They open the path to greatness if you lean into them because they uncover and shine an ever-brighter light on the truly desperate people who tangibly connect to your insight. Negative surprises are also valuable because they inform your understanding in one of three ways: your implementation is wrong; you are talking to the wrong people; or your fundamental insight was wrong in the first place. If your insight was wrong, you have saved yourself the heartache of years spent on an idea that wasn’t destined for the greatness you hoped to achieve. If you believe your insight is still right, then you can iterate on the people or the specific implementation of your insight until you unlock desperation and find yourself encountering positive surprises. The ability to notice—and savor—surprises is a key overlooked skill of the greatest founders. It allows you to narrow in on the types of capabilities that will lead to breakthroughs.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that offering customers too many benefits is a problem. In essence, by promoting too many benefits you confuse potential customers and dilute the main value proposition. Instead of clarifying the best reason that an early customer should be desperate for the product, offering too many benefits makes the decision process harder and more complex for customers. By spreading too thin over numerous benefits, you risk being forgettable or failing to effectively communicate any one compelling reason for early customers to engage. Trying to be too many things to too many people ends up being nothing to nobody. In the world of start-ups, where capturing attention and differentiating oneself is already challenging, falling into this curse can be particularly detrimental. Well-funded start-ups are often more susceptible to making this mistake because they have the money to hedge their bets rather than focus on what matters most. In our chapter on inflections, we mentioned the peril of Quibi, which folded only six months after launching in 2020, despite raising $1.75 billion and having a dream ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2316))

- team that included Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman. Besides their failure to leverage inflections, as discussed earlier, their tale was further muddled by the peril of offering an overabundance of benefits without a single compelling benefit that grabbed people’s attention in a unique way. Quibi’s deep pockets and giant ambitions resulted in a multifaceted approach, reflecting an attempt to cater to a wide range of tastes and preferences. Quibi marketed itself in many ways—from a Netflix rival to a YouTube replacement and even an Instagram alternative. Quibi did not zero in on a singular key benefit; it spread its value proposition thin, and this lack of clarity confused potential users. Quibi represented too many benefits to potential users as it struggled to establish a distinct identity or niche for itself, which contributed to its challenges in capturing a loyal audience base. As you design your implementation prototype, make sure you are clear about the most important question you want to validate regarding a prospective customer’s desperation. In the case of Chegg, the most important question was “What is the limit ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2324))

- All these circumstances point to the value of timeboxing, a time-management technique where you allocate a fixed amount of time, or a “box” of time, to a specific activity or task—in this case, prototype development. Once the allocated time has expired, the activity is considered complete, whether or not it has been finished. The purpose is to ensure that you stay focused on a task, prevent procrastination, and help manage time ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2347))

- more efficiently by limiting the duration spent on a particular task. The aim is to quickly validate if there’s genuine demand for your idea. Engaging with potential users early and often with tangible implementation ideas speeds this up. Some start-ups hesitate to do this, often because they silently fear that no one may desperately want a product that embodies their insight. Ultimately, in a start-up, there is a huge cultural difference between finding any number of desperate customers versus zero desperate customers. Many start-ups have a huge theoretical market opportunity but never find a single customer desperate for what they propose to build.

- Breakthrough start-ups behave less like marching bands and more like improv jazz bands. In the French Quarter in New Orleans, you can see them up close. The leader starts an improvisational riff. The rest of the band picks up on his cue, and moves with him to create, on the spot, a unique live performance. An improv jazz ensemble will never perform exactly that way again. It is a one-off—the result of people who read each other’s cues rather than sheet music. Think of it this way: Suppose you hire someone from a highly regarded larger company. Their initial inclination is to introduce a process familiar to them from their former workplace. This is usually a sign that you’ve hired the wrong person. Processes exist at larger companies to implement the marching-band sheet music that drives their success at scale. Your start-up needs people who can execute at the tempo and in the manner of an improv jazz band. ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2395))

- You also want people who aren’t motivated by status in the organization. Management in big companies requires clear chains of command, processes, and boundaries of accountability. But start-up teams want—and need—everyone to bring every ounce of their creative essence to the task at hand, rather than being subservient to the team’s organizational structure. These are people who all feel the rhythm and can riff on it—who thrive on chaos. Emmett Shear of Twitch paints a vivid picture of this intense, often tumultuous energy: “We were horrendously dysfunctional. We had a six-hour argument about whether to put military time or an ‘AM/PM’ next to timestamps in our chat interface. But start-ups don’t win because of excellent management. If they did, there wouldn’t be any successful start-ups. The big companies would crush them. Start-ups succeed because you have smart people who are willing to work very hard and run into and over obstacles again and again. And in the early days, nobody cares about your start-up anyway, so the consequences of screwing up aren’t that great. You’ve got nothing to lose. You have no users; there’s no one to hurt. As you get bigger, the rules change. Then you must care about screwing up, because if you screw up, that’s millions of people you’ve affected.” ([Location 2402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2402))

The right believers will form the heart of your movement, leading the world toward a new future that you build together.

- You might remember that in the late 1970s, the original Apple computer found favor with another group of alpha geeks, the sort that tinkered in garages and gathered in home-brew clubs. Those early enthusiasts respected the craft of cofounder Steve Wozniak, specifically, his way of making circuit boards simply designed but deeply functional. The early personal computer was like a blank canvas, waiting to be programmed for the next task. It could connect to a person’s home TV, and it could load the BASIC programming language from a cassette. Enthusiasts could enhance their computer with additional memory, various input/output ports, and expansion slots, creating a buzz about its potential. This excitement also fostered a community, notably in the Homebrew ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CMQCHTGF&location=2609))

With SpaceX, he targeted the US government, which had money to invest in the advancement of space travel and commercialized space opportunities—provided officials believed SpaceX could deliver. Ultimately, even NASA was persuaded that it could benefit from helping the best minds in private industry advance its agenda of extending the reach of humanity into space. It wasn’t about getting an immediate return on investment. SpaceX was NASA’s way of pushing the envelope—of taking risks that weren’t as easy for a large government agency to take on its own—with the efficiency and effectiveness that an agile start-up could offer.

- The challenge is to recognize a visionary customer when you meet one. The visionary customer is likely not living in the present; they are one of the few who live in the future. For people living in the future, their first encounter with your product clicks with their view of what’s to come. Like fellow inhabitants of the Island of Misfit Toys, they have been waiting for your idea, perhaps without fully realizing it. They might be thinking (or saying out loud), “Where have you been? This is what the future will be like.” These people are poised to co-create the future with you. It’s a great blessing to encounter them and a tragic mistake to overlook their potential to help you find a quicker path to greatness. Conversely, as a founder, it’s easy to fall into the trap of talking to any customer who will give you the time of day.

If people aren’t moving to the future the founder inhabits, it’s up to the founder to spend more time with those who are ready to move, or to be more effective in giving the right people reasons to move, or some combination of both. I meet founders who lament the fact that too few people (customers, investors, or partners) see what they see. It’s not enough to say, “I wish everyone could see what I see, but they can’t.” That’s a cop-out. If people don’t move to your future, then your future won’t happen.

- more and more people toward the future they inhabit. Authors such as Geoffrey Moore have written insightfully about how this customer-adoption life cycle works for breakthrough products. With each step they take, breakthrough founders compel more believers to join the movement. Eventually, adoption reaches a tipping point, and normal people start joining the movement as well. When this happens, your start-up’s insight becomes an accepted truth instead of a heresy, and your business makes the transition from a start-up to a company. Then you are the incumbent, and you define the rules. Of course, that’s not the end of the story—because the cycle of business life has no end. Just watch out for the next breakthrough that seeks to overturn your hard-won success, because it’s coming! The notion of moving people to the future raises another aspect of making breakthroughs real.

By contrast, you have no products or customers yet, and very few material resources. It will stay that way unless you devise a strategy to change how people think, feel, and act, so that they become your users or customers and embrace the beliefs embodied in your insight. The conventional approach of going to market assumes that there is a market, and that your goal is to gain share in that market by being better than the competition or by covering white space that incumbents haven’t. But no matter how well you do this, you will continue competing according to the established rules—rules that were designed to give incumbents an advantage.

- People typically think of movements as social or political, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights. Movements such as these succeed because they appeal to, animate, and activate people’s beliefs, while also introducing a mechanism that empowers the underdog to defeat the entrenched status quo. The civil rights movement appealed to people’s beliefs that the status quo in race relations needed to change, while introducing the mechanism of nonviolent resistance to show the terrible injustices of the status quo. Movements are organized to work outside the established system to create radical change. Within social systems, special interest groups typically work from the inside to create incremental reforms. Radical changes, however, come from revolutionaries operating outside the established system. Their position as outsiders has taught them that they need to engage in different tactics because they lack the resources and the access to the system enjoyed by special interest groups. The business world can be viewed through the same lens. Most start-ups act more like interest groups than revolutionaries. They work within the existing system of business and offer something that’s an improvement over existing ways of going about life.
