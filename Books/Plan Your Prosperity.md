## Highlights
- I have two primary and very specific ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=195))
- goals with this book—and some specific goals this book is not aimed at. First, I hope to help you stop thinking about investing in a spliced-up way—that you should invest for a number of years one way, then one day, a buzzer goes off signaling it’s time to ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=195))
- think about retirement. No! Instead, from the first time you fund an IRA or otherwise set money aside, I hope to get you thinking not just about retirement, but about investing for your whole life. And if you haven’t been thinking that way all along, there’s no time like the ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=198))
- present to change. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=200))
- So I want you, right now, to stop thinking about investing and retirement investing and start thinking ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=204))
- about investing for the entirety of your life. I want you to think about making plans now that increase the odds you achieve your goals, whatever they may be. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=205))
- But for now, think of your benchmark as an essential investing lifeline. It’s a road map, showing your planned route—and how to take detours when necessary. It lets you know how ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=222))
- you’re doing—if you’re going too slow or even too fast or getting lost in the weeds or utterly turned around. It can help you stay disciplined (an incredibly important yet often overlooked facet of successful investing). Overall, the benchmark, picked appropriately, ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=223))
- can increase the odds you achieve your long-term goals. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=225))
- Far too many investors invest without a benchmark at all—never mind an appropriate one. They effectively stick their thumbs in the air, ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=228))
- hitchhiking along with whatever tactics suit their fancy at a point in time. What’s worse, they may not even realize they’re doing that! ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=228))
- a benchmark is, you don’t have one), the odds increase you may be meandering. And meandering is a bad path to prosperity. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=231))
- No one can guarantee you reach your goals. Not even you can. First, investing ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=248))
- involves the risk of loss. Can’t escape it. You could bury cash in your backyard and avoid all volatility risk—but you’re still fully exposed to inflation risk. Which means having to earn and save a lot more, and/or downgrading your future cash needs and/or not minding your ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=248))
- purchasing power being eroded over time. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=250))
- Your aim should be taking steps to identify goals, picking a benchmark and an appropriate plan, then doing what’s necessary to stick to it. And my aim is to help you. That’s how we increase the odds. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=256))
- And, again, this should be a deliberate ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=258))
- undertaking, whether you go it alone or with a professional. Because not only is it critical you pick an appropriate benchmark, but you must also understand the risk and return characteristics of that specific benchmark. You must understand them so you can be prepared (mentally ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=258))
- and emotionally) to accept the shorter-term volatility of your benchmark. (And yes, unless investing in cash, all benchmarks will experience shorter-term volatility.) And no matter how prepared you are, shorter-term downside volatility can sometimes be difficult to ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=260))
- experience. But the value of an appropriate benchmark is it can aid you in remaining disciplined ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=262))
- Instead, my aim is to help you help yourself pick a benchmark that’s the foundation ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=271))
- for a plan that’s appropriate. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=272))
- There are no shortcuts. No doubt, many readers hope such a book exists. In my view, it doesn’t. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=275))
- Also, this book isn’t on the nitty-gritty of portfolio management—how to pick securities and which ones and when. To cover that would require vastly more pages. Plus, that’s generally what my ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=279))
- other books are about. Read this one first, and, when you’re ready, read The Only Three Questions That Still Count, Debunkery and/or Markets Never Forget (my 2007, 2010 and 2011 books). But you can’t start deciding what to buy and sell and when and why if you don’t have your ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=281))
- road map—your benchmark. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=283))
- There are other aspects of financial/retirement planning this book ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=285))
- won’t address. If you’re confused about what those aspects are, the official definition of financial planning is: There isn’t one. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=285))
- The financial plan is, often, a way for practitioners to get a foot in the door and sell something (or somethings) else that pays a commission—like a mutual fund, insurance, annuity or tax services. Because being a commission-based or fee-based salesperson is often more lucrative than ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=299))
- being a fee-based planner getting paid to do one plan, once, for a household—simply because such a strategy requires a relatively non-stop influx of new customers, which can be tough to keep up long term. Not that there aren’t plenty of fee-based planners making a fine living ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=300))
- doing just that. Up to the practitioners how they want to run their businesses. And I don’t have a view on which format is better for them or for you. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=302))
- With your investments, you may be thinking, “What if I live to be 90? Am I doing the right thing to ensure my money doesn’t run out before then?” ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=320))
- Budgeting, insurance, estate planning—these are all important considerations. But this book focuses almost exclusively on the investing aspect. Why? I’m an investor—have been my entire adult life. It’s my specialty and that of the firm I founded and currently head as CEO. It’s what I’ve ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=324))
- written about in my monthly Forbes columns since 1984 and is the subject of, now, nine books. This is my wheelhouse. Though insurance is important, I’m not sure you want to hear what I have to say about buying it. For that, you want an insurance expert. Ditto for estate ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=327))
- planning. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=329))
- In the same way, if you need heart surgery, you see a cardiac specialist. If you have diabetes, you go to an endocrinologist. If you get cancer, you see an oncologist. Specialization is so common in the medical field now, no ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=330))
- one thinks much about it—but that same concept is often less highly regarded elsewhere. Physicians (like many capitalists) seem to have grasped the concept if you specialize in everything, you often do nothing truly well. And yet, it wasn’t always that way. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=331))
- Specialization of labor is a hallmark of capitalism and the lifeblood of global trade. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=343))
- There are myriad mistakes investors make. Many of the books I write focus at least in part on common investing errors and how to better avoid them. My view is investing well ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=425))
- is at least two-thirds about not making mistakes. If you can avoid common errors most investors make, you can lower your error rate on average and get better results over the long term. Said another way: If you invest long term, you will make mistakes. You should ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=426))
- expect it. The goal should be identifying errors you’re likely to make and trying to avoid those. And failing to stick with an appropriate strategy is a major error many investors make. Repeatedly. Maybe you’ve already made this mistake. Maybe a few times! And maybe you don’t even realize ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=429))
- it. (Many folks don’t.) ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=431))
- A bit simplistic but perhaps useful way to think of those (and many other) cognitive errors is they tend to fall into the broad ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=444))
- buckets of “greed” and “fear.” Which one is motivating you now? And why? ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=445))
- Thousands of years ago, running ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=447))
- when fearful probably served early humans well. In investing, the reverse is often true. After all, Warren Buffett popularized the (very often true) statement, “You should be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=447))
- Whereas growth—even mild growth—requires some volatility risk. Can’t get upside volatility without the downside. “Capital preservation and growth” sounds phenomenal. Grow ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=554))
- your portfolio and never lose value! Who doesn’t want that? Except it’s like fat-free steak—near-universally appealing but not possible. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=556))
- So anyone who tells you your goal can be capital preservation and growth at the same time is providing you a service by unwittingly warning you off. He’s either telling you he ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=564))
- doesn’t know much about capital markets, or he’s trying to deceive you. Either way, run. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=565))
- Milton Friedman famously said, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” What he meant was inflation is about money supply—nothing else. Not gold. Not debt. Not trade deficits. Not oil prices. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=589))
    - Tags: [[inflation]] 
- Not any of the other things headlines scream cause inflation. Money supply. If money supply increases faster than economic activity can mop up the excess, prices rise—and prices rising on average is inflation. This is often described as “too much money chasing too few ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=591))
- goods.” ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=593))
- Irving Fisher’s (no relation) famous equation (which Milton Friedman ascribed to) described the relationship between money supply and prices as: ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=594))
- Well, yes, all government data should be taken with a grain of salt. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=672))
- The S&P 500 Total Return Index is a fine all-US equity benchmark. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=764))
- You can’t get broader than a global index, so a good benchmark might be the MSCI World Index, which includes developed economies. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=765))
- How is the benchmark a road map? It tells you from a high level what to include in your portfolio. If you have ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=770))
- an all-equity global benchmark, then your asset allocation should be 100% global stocks—most of the time. If the benchmark is 50% US/50% non-US, your portfolio should be close to that—usually. (We get to exceptions later.) Just as you wouldn’t get into your car to drive cross-country without a map or a GPS, you don’t want to start managing a portfolio (or let someone else do it) without a benchmark—you can end up lost either way. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=771))
- The benchmark can be your leash, keeping you disciplined. Be very similar to your benchmark and you’ll likely get similar-to-benchmark returns. This means you’ll endure whatever volatility your benchmark doles out (and yes, bond indexes experience price volatility, too). ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=789))
- You should expect it. But as long as you stay disciplined to your benchmark, over time, it should get you where you need to go (provided you pick the right one). The more you deviate from your benchmark, the more your returns will differ. And that can be fine! That’s how ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=791))
- you can outperform it over time, if that’s your goal (and if it’s done right). But you don’t want to aim to beat your benchmark by any more than you’re prepared to lag it in a given year. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=793))
- At my firm, we get a bit more granular. We believe about 70% of portfolio return is determined by the high-level stocks/bonds/cash/other securities decision ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=839))
- and about 20% is driven by sub-asset allocation decisions—that is, what kinds of securities you are holding. (See Figure 3.1.) Are you holding more big-cap stocks or small? Growth or value? What is your weighting in the major sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Financials, ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=840))
- etc.? What about sub-industry selection? For bonds, are you holding Treasurys, munis or corporates? What credit rating? What duration? And ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=842))
- so on. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=843))
- In selecting an appropriate benchmark (the core of your retirement investing plan and driving all later ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1079))
- investment decisions), your first stop is time horizon. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1080))
- But remember, investing is about considering probabilities, not trying to outmaneuver every possibility. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1497))
- I don’t buy it. Neither should you. Here’s why. Moore’s Law. If you get in your bones the concept of Moore’s Law, you ([Location 1577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1577))
- know innovation isn’t at an end. Moore’s Law states the number of transistors that can fit on an integrated circuit should double every two years. Gordon Moore, the visionary co-founder of Intel, first conceived that in a paper in 1965. And that prediction was about spot-on—development ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1578))
- of integrated circuits has about followed that pace. But it wasn’t just about integrated circuits. What Moore conceptualized was the endless and exponential upward sweep of innovation. That innovation will build upon ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1580))
- innovation in perfectly unpredictable ways. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1583))
- Hence, unless you believe humanity has altered so much people are no longer motivated to innovate, problem-solve and chase profits, then stocks should continue to be superior to all ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1596))
- similarly liquid asset classes. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1597))
- In creating a retirement investing ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1783))
- plan, you should care much more about total return—i.e., price appreciation plus dividends—rather than just dividend yield. That allows you to pick a benchmark based on your goals and time horizon, not just on a dividend yield. Focusing solely on dividend yield can ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1784))
- mean badly lagging what you would have gotten otherwise as high-dividend stocks go out of favor or watching dividends periodically shrink or get cut. Not a great strategy. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1786))
- But how can you know if your cash flow goal is reasonable? A good tool professionals often use is a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation approximates the probability of certain outcomes using random variables run in multiple iterations. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1867))
- In my view, when measuring investment results, it’s better to do a bootstrap analysis—another form of Monte Carlo. ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1874))
- Or you can find one online (there’s one here: www.moneychimp.com/articles/volatility/montecarlo.htm ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MB9JO6&location=1883))
