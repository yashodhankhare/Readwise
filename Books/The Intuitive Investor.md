## Highlights
- To be clear, the right brain is understood to be the portion of ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=206))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the mind that handles organic, multi-dimensional, creative, and intuitive processes. Whereas, it is understood and accepted that the left brain is the portion of the mind responsible for linear and analytical processes. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=206))

- Anxiety about these bad things stands in the way of your ability to clearly access your creativity and intuition and leads to too much mental noise. In turn, this diminishes your ability to make prescient, timely, and accurate intuitive decisions. I will specifically teach you techniques for not only how to mitigate your anxieties, but also how to take advantage of them. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=250))

- Because creativity and intuition are often ephemeral I have carefully structured this book to provide it with a firm grounding. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=277))

- In short, investing is about separating great investment probabilities from investment possibilities. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=391))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are several traditional definitions of investing. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=407))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The following is from the American Heritage Dictionary:4  in•vest [(in-věst’)]; verb. 1. To commit (money or capital) in order to gain a financial return: “invested their savings in stocks and ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=408))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- bonds.” 2. a. To spend or devote for future advantage or benefit: “invested much time and energy in getting a good education.” b. To devote morally or psychologically, as to a purpose; commit: “Men of your generation are invested in what they do, women in what you are” (Shana Alexander). Alternatively you have from the Investopedia5 the following: Investing: The act of committing money or capital to an ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=410))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- endeavor (a business, project, real estate, etc.) with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit. Investing also can include the amount of time you put into the study of a prospective company, especially since time is money. These definitions are fine. But they assume a context that makes them too limiting. And that just does not serve the purpose of unlocking your whole brain for greater investment success. Theses definitions assume that investing is solely about money and capital. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=415))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is the understanding that most people have about investing. But let’s explore a different definition that reveals the full power of investing as both a science and an art. Investing is: 1. Making a decision 2. Consciously making choices so that the benefits of those choices exceed the costs of those choices 3. Consciously expending energy (i.e., resources) so that the benefits of the expended energy exceed the costs of the expended energy ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=419))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The definition of “investing” is expanded beyond the realms of money and capital because the skills you are exploring are used in all of your life. This is because life is a continuous flow of decisions. And decisions are subject to analysis and scrutiny, as well as your creativity and intuition. In short, decisions/investments are best when you are fully conscious, and that means that you are utilizing your mind’s full powers. You constantly make investment decisions even if you are not conscious that you are. Please have this new definition of ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=424))

- investing in mind as we proceed. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=428))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The most important investment skill is understanding information. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=439))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Having bad information ≠ bad investment choices. Having good information ≠ good investment choices. Understanding bad information = avoiding bad investment choices. Understanding good information = good investment choices. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=445))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Investing Is As Much About Intuition As It Is Analysis Understanding information is the most important investment skill. But unfortunately, most investors suffer from the opposite situation: a misunderstanding of information. Specifically, one of the most important of all investing secrets is that: ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=456))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is because they rely upon linearity for understanding information from what is a non-linear, organic, multidimensional world. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=545))
    - Tags: [[pink]]

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This isn’t because the right brain is superior to the left brain. It is because most investors overlook the power of their right brain to solve investment problems and to provide them with actionable information. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=565))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Behavioral Finance has as its purpose highlighting the limitations of the right brain, in order to refine the left brain. I will be talking about the exact opposite problem: the limitations of the left brain with the goal of higher refinement of the right brain. Behavioral finance is a subject well worth exploring, but its many axioms and prescriptions have largely been developed to answer questions in which an exact and quantifiable answer is possible. But as previously discussed: there is no such thing as a future fact. Behavioral finance cannot ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=572))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- answer the truly important questions confronting you as an investor. An example of such a question is: Why is this business worth my money? Because you are dealing with the future when you make investment decisions, behavioral finance cannot help you entirely because of its limitations. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=576))

- The right brain also does a good job of serving as a bridge between intuitive insight and the analytical structuring that turns intuition into money. If numbers and words are the currency of the left brain, then ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=582))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So the secret to tapping into your intuition is to strip away the noise of our emotions to get at the clear, true signal of the feeling-sense that intuition provides. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=633))

- The sum of the two distinct aspects of your brain is greater than the sum of its parts. When the two halves are functioning in concert it results in a synergistic display of intelligent and prudent investment decisions whose results can be fantastic.

After all, most of you have heard of “financial analysts,” but how many of you have heard of “financial intuitionists?” So there is some catching up to do.

- jargon. There is a constant news flow about the world and about your investments. There is a continual need to reevaluate. There are difficult decisions to be made. Investing is often disorienting and spawns many intense moments that are utterly mystifying. This is especially true when you tackle new investment problems whose prospective solutions do not respond to your old ways of doing things. But how do you transform your emotions of chaos, panic, and disorder into potent tools?

- exploration. Principle I, Infinity, asks you to be as free of boundaries as possible. For example, in order to wrap the mind around a bewildering event like September 11, 2001, an understanding of personal strengths and limitations is needed. What is more, an understanding of the interconnections of the daunting flow of information is needed—otherwise there is paralysis and an inability to make critical, timely decisions.

- For intuition to work fully-fledged, emotions have to be consciously controlled. Otherwise emotions introduce projected prejudice into the signal we receive from our intuitive sense.

- You move from having the experience of your emotions to being the observer of your emotions. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=802))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Anxiety is an unconscious manifestation of old emotional traumas, whereas fear is a natural and essential intuitive feeling from deep within yourself ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=863))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that serves as a warning of an impending threat that could potentially be harmful to you. The emotion of anxiety is among the most self-destructive in investing. Anxiety can paralyze and lead to catatonic indecision. Yet investing demands that timely, lucid decisions are made even in the presence of discomfort. Worst of all, anxiety is one of the most powerful obstructions to a healthy intuition. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=864))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So a primary difference between anxiety and fear is that new difficult situations, for which you have no natural learned response, ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=905))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- usually trigger actual fear. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=905))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Whereas, if you have dealt with a similar fearful situation in the past for which you have an automatic, conditioned response, then this is most likely anxiety. But the reason that the brain constructed these defensive mechanisms, experienced as anxiety, is that the source of our intuition is deeply sensitive and is easily wounded. We all have experienced emotional trauma. These past events wounded our feeling selves so defenses were purposely and usefully erected to prevent further damage. The trick is to gain conscious control over ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=906))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- when these defenses are up and when they are down and also to evaluate whether or not they are still necessary. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=909))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Unconscious anxiety does not serve you. Anxiety is the blur of emotion that makes your thinking hazy and prevents you from dismantling old, reflexive, restrictive emotional responses. Anxiety prevents you from growing as a person and as an investor. Fear serves you. It lets you know that you need to pay attention—that the fish is out of its water. So when you are experiencing ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=910))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- what feels like fear, you must stop and ask yourself if this is in response to a new, difficult, and threatening situation. Or is your response similar to many other similar situations in your past? If this is a new situation, you have to honor your feeling of fear. If you find your response to the situation to be the result of an old pattern, then proceed to the next step. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=913))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Instead you choose to transform your emotions into thoughts. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=918))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So when you experience anxiety, calm down by assuring yourself that you are safe and that you are not in immediate harm. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=920))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With this breathing room, you now change your anxiety from an emotion into a thought. This may take some practice, but it is possible. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AJQYDXU&location=921))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Additionally, too much of an emphasis on the past is likely to be an indication of too much of an emphasis on the left brain and its anal retention—there are always more facts to analyze. Obsession with the past is also a very strong indication of either or both the emotions of ignorance and fear being present; nothing that occurred in the past will definitively answer what will happen in the future.
