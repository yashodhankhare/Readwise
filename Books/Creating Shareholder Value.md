## Highlights
- This book presents major applications of the shareholder value approach to management planning and performance evaluation. Not only is the rationale for the shareholder value approach presented, but the tools needed to implement it as the standard for business performance are provided as well. The shareholder value approach can be used to analyze publicly traded or privately held corporations, as well as business units, strategies, or product lines. Throughout the book an effort is made to integrate operating and financial analysis. In particular, the direct linkage between competitive strategy and shareholder value analysis is demonstrated by translating business strategies into the dollars of value they create. What is most encouraging is that the shareholder value applications presented here have been introduced and successfully implemented by an ever-increasing number of companies in the United States and other major economies around the world.

- For example, retailing establishments, particularly large department stores sitting on valuable downtown real estate, missed the opportunity to sell the real estate and redeploy the cash to value-creating growth or, in the absence of profitable investment opportunities, distribute the cash to shareholders. In each of these cases the stock market predictably penalized the companies’ shares. This led to the infamous “value ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=181))

- gap,” i.e., the difference between the value of the company if it were operated to maximize shareholder value and its current market value. A positive “value gap” was an invitation to well-financed corporate raiders to bid for the company and replace incumbent management. The only compelling takeover defense is to close the “value gap” by delivering superior shareholder value. Whatever one thinks of raiders and their tactics, the threats of takeovers did prompt CEOs to give long-overdue focus to delivering value for shareholders.

- Over the past few years institutional investors have substantially increased their efforts to gain better returns for the beneficiaries of the funds they manage. Their primary approach has been to shine the spotlight on underperforming companies and promote changes in either corporate strategy or in management itself.

- Maximizing shareholder value is now embraced as the “politically correct” stance by corporate board members and top management in the United States. As is the case with other good ideas, shareholder value has moved from being ignored to being rejected to becoming self-evident.

- In a world in which principals (e.g., stockholders) have imperfect control over their agents (e.g., managers), these agents may not always engage in transactions solely in the best interests of the principals. Agents have their own objectives and it may sometimes pay them to sacrifice the principals’ interests. There are, however, a number of factors that induce management to act in the best interests of shareholders. These factors derive from the fundamental premise that the greater the expected unfavorable consequences to the manager who decreases the wealth of shareholders, the less likely it is that the manager will, in fact, act against the interests of shareholders. Consistent with the above premise, at least four major factors will induce management to adopt a shareholder orientation: (1) a relatively large ownership position, (2) compensation tied to shareholder return performance, (3) threat of takeover by another organization, and (4) competitive labor markets for corporate executives.

- Economic rationality dictates that stock ownership by management motivates executives to identify more closely with the shareholders’ economic interests. Indeed, we would expect that the greater the proportion of personal wealth invested in company stock or tied to stock options, the greater would be management’s shareholder orientation. While the top executives in many companies often have relatively large percentages of their wealth invested in company stock, this is much less often the case for divisional and business unit… ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=218))

- Even when corporate executives own shares in their company, their viewpoint on the acceptance of risk may differ from that of shareholders. It is reasonable to expect that many corporate executives have a lower tolerance for risk. If the company invests in a risky project, stockholders can always balance this risk against other risks in their presumably diversified portfolios. The manager, however, can balance a project failure only against the other activities of the division or the company. Thus, managers are hurt by the failure more than shareholders. The second factor likely to influence management to adopt a shareholder orientation is compensation tied to shareholder return performance. The most direct means of linking top management’s interests with those of shareholders is to base compensation, and particularly the incentive portion, on market returns realized by shareholders. Exclusive reliance on shareholder returns, however, has its own limitations. First, movements in a company’s stock price may well be greatly influenced by factors beyond management control such as the overall state of the economy and stock market. Second,… ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=222))

- The third factor affecting management behavior is the threat of takeover by another company. Tender offers have become a commonly employed means of transferring corporate control. Moreover the size of the targets continues to become larger. The threat of takeover is an essential means of constraining corporate managers who might choose to pursue personal goals at the expense of shareholders. Any significant exploitation of shareholders should be reflected in a lower stock price. This lower price, relative to what it might be with more efficient management, offers an attractive takeover opportunity for another company, which in many cases will replace incumbent management. An active market for corporate control places limits on the divergence of interests between management and shareholders. The fourth and final factor influencing management’s shareholder orientation is the labor market for corporate executives. Managerial labor markets are an essential mechanism for motivating management to function in the best interests of shareholders. Managers compete for positions both within and outside of the firm. The increasing number of executive recruiting firms and the length of the “Who’s News” column in the Wall Street Journal are evidence that the managerial labor… ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=232))

- and stakeholder advocates sometimes embrace different issues, each calls for the corporation to have a purpose beyond maximizing returns to shareholders. In a market-based economy that recognizes the rights of private property, the only social responsibility of business is to create shareholder value and to do so legally and with integrity. Critical social issues in education, health care, drug abuse, and the environment pose enormous social challenges. Corporate management, however, has neither the political legitimacy nor the expertise to decide what is in the social interest. Our form of government calls for elected legislators and the judicial system to be the mechanisms for collective choice. Ironically, costs that social responsibility advocates would impose on corporations often are costs that voters through the political process would be unwilling to bear. Such imposed costs invariably will be passed on to consumers by way of higher prices, to employees as lower wages, or to shareholders as lower returns. There still is no free lunch.

- The stakeholder model that attempts to balance the interests of everyone with a stake in the company makes it easier for corporate managers to justify uneconomic diversification or overinvestment in a declining core business, since these moves are likely to be endorsed by constituencies other than shareholders. For employees it means more jobs—in the short run. Suppliers enjoy the prospect of additional business, and the local community gets a larger tax base resulting from the increased size of the company. Also, business decisions based on social criteria often bring personal praise for the chief executive officer. But it is these decisions that subordinate shareholder interests that trigger the much maligned corrective mechanisms of takeovers and restructuring.

- to serve all stakeholders, companies must be competitive if they are to survive. This view further recognizes that a company’s long-term destiny depends on a financial relationship with each stakeholder that has an interest in the company.

To satisfy these claims management must generate cash by… ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=288))

- Two stakeholders, customers and employees, merit further examination. First consider the case of customers. Even the most persistent advocate of shareholder value understands that without customer value there can be no shareholder value. The source of a company’s long-term cash flow is its satisfied customers. On the other hand, providing customer satisfaction does not automatically translate into shareholder value. Providing a comparable product at a lower cost than competitors, or providing superior value to the customer through higher quality, special features, or postsale services, are not genuine advantages if the total long-term cost, including the cost of capital, is greater than the cash generated by the sale. A business that provides more value than customers are willing to pay for is hardly competitive—and may not even be viable. The euphoria associated with investments in total-quality programs sometimes exempts such major investments from careful shareholder-value scrutiny. Consider, for example, the Wallace Company, a Houston, Texas-based pipe and valve distributor that won the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1990. Wallace’s quality program significantly increased on-time deliveries as well as its market share. Customers, however, were unwilling to accept the price increases initiated to offset the costs of the quality program. As a result, the company began to lose money, lay off… ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=295))

- While conflicts between customer value and shareholder interests can be quantified and appropriately resolved by sound shareholder value analysis, conflicts between employee and shareholder interests pose a substantially more difficult challenge. A curious coalition of liberal and conservative commentators has laid the blame of employee insecurity on CEOs who downsize their companies to increase stock price. The same commentators that just a few years ago were lambasting CEOs for underperforming against foreign competitors are now criticizing CEOs for downsizing to improve competitiveness. In most cases CEOs are responding to advances brought about by stunning new technology, pressure from more efficient domestic or foreign… ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=307))

- Government regulation that presumably “helps” companies to act in the social interest invariably leads to even greater employee insecurity. Many European governments and unions try to protect jobs by making it very costly to lay off employees. This interference with market forces has led to less competitive, high-cost companies and unemployment rates more than twice those experienced in this country. In contrast to the significant restructuring undertaken in the United States, overstaffed companies in Japan and Germany are just beginning to acknowledge that global competition will compel them to do the same. Even at extraordinarily low interest rates in Japan, there is virtually no net increase in corporate borrowing because there are so few profitable investment opportunities. To regain its momentum, Japan will have to reestablish itself as an attractive place to invest in by lowering its costs through a combination of corporate restructuring and government deregulation. In the meantime, implementation of shareholder value has helped transform American industry into the most competitive in the world, after a period when all the talk focused on its dismal performance. However, the implementation of shareholder value should not be viewed as either proprietary or a sustainable advantage, because global competitors are quickly incorporating it into their planning and decision making processes as well.

- There is unfortunately another side to restructuring and employee layoffs. Not all downsizing is based on long-term shareholder value considerations. Some downsizing decisions are predicated on reporting better short-term earnings rather than focusing on the longer term position of the business. For example, layoffs in companies that depend heavily on personal relationships with customers can adversely affect longer term profitability. Moreover, such downsizing may also adversely affect the morale and productivity of the remaining work force. The source of the problem here is not the use of the shareholder value approach. Theproblem instead is its misuse or nonuse, which has led to value-destroyingdownsizings for companies and their shareholders and uncalled-for dislocations and pain for employees.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- How can employee interests be aligned with shareholder interests in the face of restructuring and layoff announcements that so often trigger increases in the share price? The most frequent suggestion is that employees be granted meaningful stakes in the company’s stock.6 The argument is that because employees are now also shareholders who will benefit from efficiency-enhancing plant closings and layoffs, they would support these value-creating actions. But such support will come only from those whose stock appreciation exceeds their loss from being laid off. The proportion of stock required in compensation packages to align employee interests with those of shareholders is in most instances simply not feasible. Even if it were, employees concentrating their human and financial capital in one company ignores the wisdom of diversification. I believe that the better solution lies in offering employees meaningful incentives for creating value. Recommended measures and their linkage to incentives are detailed in Chapter 7.

When we realize that shareholders are not “them” but are “us,” the case for shareholder value becomes even more compelling.

- In Chapter 1 providing maximum return for shareholders was established as the fundamental objective of the business corporation. It was further established that shareholder return is generated by dividends and increases in share price. The issue to be addressed now is whether accounting earnings as a standard for assessing alternative strategies and measuring subsequent performance is consistent with ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=394))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the shareholder return objective. Stated more concretely, the issue is whether earnings can reliably measure the change in the present value of the firm. There are several important reasons why earnings fail to measure changes in the economic value of the firm: Alternative accounting methods may be employed. Investment requirements are excluded. Time value of money is ignored. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=397))

- A change in accounting method for financial reporting purposes, whether mandated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or simply dictated by management choice, can materially impact earnings but does not alter the company’s cash flows and therefore should not affect its economic value. This assumes that the change in accounting is for financial reporting purposes and does not affect the computation of income taxes. It is, of course, also possible that an accounting change is seen as a signal for some more fundamental changes in the company’s prospects.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The relationship between the change in economic value and earnings is further obscured by the fact that investments in working capital and fixed capital needed to sustain the firm are excluded from the earnings calculation. Consider the case of working capital. As a business grows, normally there will be an associated growth in its level of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. An increase in receivables between the beginning and end of the year means that the cash flow from sales is less than the revenue figure reflected in the income statement. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=424))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To illustrate, assume current year’s sales are $10 million, receivables at the beginning of the year, $1 million, and year-end receivables are $1.2 million. Cash flow from sales for the year is calculated as follows: ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=428))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What is important to recognize is that the $10 million sales figure does not represent the current period’s cash generated. Instead, cash flow from sales is total sales less the $200,000 increase in accounts receivable. The $200,000 is not available to meet current cash commitments. For accounting purposes revenue is recognized at the time goods or services are delivered. For purposes of economic valuation, recognition must await the receipt of cash. In brief, cash is received after revenue is recognized. Thus for companies with expanding receivables the sales figure on the income statement will overstate the current period’s cash flow generated from sales. Inventory investment is another important component of working capital ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=434))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that contributes to differences between earnings and the cash-flow valuation approach. An increase in the level of inventory clearly involves cash payments for materials, labor, and overhead. For accrual accounting purposes the investment in additional inventory is, however, reflected as an asset on the balance sheet and is not included in the cost of sales figure appearing in the income statement. Therefore for companies with expanding inventory levels, the cost of sales figure will understate the current period’s cash outflow for inventory expenditures. In brief, for expanding firms, increases in accounts receivable and inventories will cause the earnings figure to be greater than cash flow. The third major component of working capital, payables, acts as a countervailing force. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities represent unpaid bills for items already included as expenses in the income statement or for increases in inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Thus, the cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expense accounts in the income statement overstate the cash outflow by the amount of the related increase in payables. In other words, cash is disbursed after the expense is recognized. A reconciliation of earnings and cash flows for assumed changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable and accruals is presented in Table 2-1. In brief, to arrive at cash flow the earnings figure must be adjusted by $440,000. This amount represents the ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=440))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We now turn from working capital to investment in fixed assets. Depreciable assets such as property, plant, and equipment are initially recorded at cost and included in the fixed asset section of the balance sheet. Accountants then allocate this cost over the estimated useful life of the asset through depreciation. They often stress that depreciation is a process of allocating original cost and not a process of valuation. Depreciation on fixed assets purchased during the current year as well as on those purchased in prior years is a deduction to arrive at net income. But while depreciation is an expense, it does not involve an outlay of cash. On the other hand, the earnings number will not include the capital expenditures made during the year. Thus, to move from earnings to cash flow, two adjustments are needed. First, the depreciation must be added back to earnings and second, capital expenditures must be deducted from earnings. Incorporating the adjustments discussed in this section, cash flow from operations may be calculated as follows: Cash flow from operations = Sales - Operating expenses including taxes +expenses including taxes Depreciation and other noncash items - Incremental working capital investment - Capital expenditures ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=471))

- earnings and economic value, it should come as no surprise that earnings growth does not necessarily lead to the creation of economic value for shareholders. Shareholder value will increase only if the company earns a rate of return on new investments greater than the rate investors can expect to earn by investing in alternative, equally risky, securities. Earnings growth, however, can be achieved not only when management is investing at or above the market discount rate or cost of capital, but also when it is investing below the cost of capital and thereby decreasing the value of common shares.

- In summary, an increase or decrease in earnings may not give rise to a corresponding increase or decrease in shareholder value because the earnings figure does not reflect the company’s level of business and financial risk, nor does it take into account the working capital and fixed investment needed for anticipated growth. In addition, the earnings figure is affected by a wide variety of accounting conventions governing the assignment of costs to current and future time periods. Such accounting conventions do not ordinarily affect a firm’s cash flow and hence should not affect the value of the firm.

- Hurdle rates or minimum acceptable rates for ROI are often based on an estimate of the business unit’s cost of capital or the corporate cost of capital. The assumption is that if ROI is greater than the cost of capital, then shareholder value will be created. The essential problem with this approach is that ROI is an accrual accounting return and is being compared to a cost of capital measure which is an economic return demanded by investors. Comparing one with the other is clearly an example of comparing apples with oranges. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=549))

- The growing percentage of investments directed toward intangibles such as information, training, and research rather than tangible fixed assets also has had a profound effect upon the usefulness of ROI and ROE as valuation benchmarks.

Others oppose this suggestion on the grounds that any such estimates are not sufficiently reliable to warrant a place on the balance sheet or in a company’s financial reports. This is not the forum to enter into this debate. There is, however, a crucial observation that needs to be emphasized. Accounting numbers and traditional financial ratios will be affected by the movement from industrial companies to knowledge companies. Shareholder value calculations will not. In a cash-flow-based shareholder value analysis, $1 million spent for knowledge and $1 million spent for tangible assets are treated identically.

What is recognized is that $1 million of cash has been spent and the wisdom of the investment will be reflected in subsequent cash flows.

- Productivity, the value of output produced by a unit of labor or capital, is the foundation for creating competitive advantage in the marketplace. A business creates competitive advantage when the long-term value of its output or sales is greater than its total costs, including its cost of capital. This advantage can be achieved by providing superior value or lower prices. It is also productivity that the stock market reacts to when pricing a company’s shares. Embedded in all shares is an implied long-term forecast about a company’s productivity—that is, its ability to create value in excess of the cost of producing it. When the stock market prices a company’s shares according to a belief that the company will ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1200))

In this way, productivity is the hinge on which both competitive advantage and shareholder value hang. But then why is it that so many executives sense a conflict between the two? Often it is because those companies with competitive advantages do not always produce the best results for their shareholders. But there is a perfectly sound reason for this. If the competitive advantage that a company enjoys is incorporated fully into its stock price there is no… ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1205))

- not only competitively debilitating but it also is based on an inaccurate view of the market’s pricing mechanism. There are three factors that determine stock prices: cash flows, a long-term forecast of these cash flows, and the cost of capital or discount rate that reflects the relative riskiness of a company’s cash flows. The present value of a company’s future cash flows, not its quarterly earnings, determines its stock price. Fortunately, there is considerable evidence that the stock market takes the long view. The most direct evidence comes from assessing what the stock price tells us about the market’s expectations concerning the company’s future performance. In other words, what level and duration of cash flows justify today’s stock price? Studies consistently confirm that current stock prices are based on long-term forecasts of cash flows. For example, The LEK/Alcar Consulting Group, LLC analyzed the stock prices of the thirty Dow Jones Industrial companies and found that typically between 80 to 90 percent of their prices were attributable to expected cash flows or dividends beginning after five years.

At the end of the value growth duration, it is assumed that the company will earn at its cost of capital rate. A less direct way of understanding the long-term orientation of the stock market is to compare an investment in stocks with an investment in bonds. The average dividend yield in the stock market today is about 2 percent. An investment in thirty-year government bonds yields about 6.5 percent. Why would rational investors ever buy stocks when they can realize higher current yields on less risky bonds? While the investor’s primary interest is in capital gains rather than dividends, the gains are uncertain, whereas dividends exhibit systematic growth over time. The long-term dividend growth rate of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stocks is approximately 6 percent. At that rate it takes just over twenty years before the current 2 percent dividend yield reaches today’s bond yield of 6.5 percent.

In fact, in all market-leading companies we observed—corporations like Wal-Mart, Southwest Air, FedEx, Glaxo, Airborne, and Intel—customer value, shareholder wealth, and employee satisfaction move in lockstep. These companies view customer value as the indispensable source of both shareholder value and employee satisfaction.

Enlightened managers, however, will not accept uncritically the assumption that shareholder value moves in lockstep with customer value. Instead, they will treat these recommendations with constructive skepticism and test all resulting strategies for their value creation potential.

- Two of the guiding principles for shareholder value management are: invest only in opportunities with credible potential to create value and return cash to shareholders when value-creating investments are not available. The principles are understood easily, but frequently are not implemented. Share repurchases have become an important complement to dividends for returning cash to shareholders. Multibillion-dollar share repurchase announcements by companies such as General Electric, IBM, and Philip Morris have become commonplace. Why do companies repurchase their shares? Three reasons are typically cited. The first, and perhaps most popular justification, is that it sends a signal to the market that the company’s shares are undervalued. Management presumably also believes that funds used to repurchase shares do not conflict with attractive opportunities to reinvest in the business. Research studies show that on average stock prices respond positively to announcements of share repurchases. These studies also suggest that premium tender-offer share repurchases rather than open-market repurchases are most appropriate for reducing significant market undervaluation. In a reasonably efficient market, management would be prudent to conduct a careful valuation before concluding that its shares are undervalued seriously.

- in a number of situations where market-undervaluation claims made by senior management were overturned by the company’s own detailed assessment of value. Remember, purchasing a fairly valued stock will not add value and purchasing overvalued shares destroys value for continuing shareholders. A second argument for stock repurchase is that it is a more tax-efficient means of distributing cash to shareholders than dividends. Tendering shareholders pay taxes only on their capital gains. These gains are taxed at the lower capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates. Moreover, shareholders may choose not to sell their shares and thereby incur no tax liability.

- As expected, the shareholder value per share is identical for all three cases. After all, when a company reinvests in its businesses at the same rate of return that can be achieved from a share repurchase we should expect identical value consequences. What are the implications of this analysis for the reinvest-in-the-business versus repurchase decision? Opportunities for most businesses range from relatively high returns to returns modestly above the cost of capital. In the above case, management should target investments in the 10 to 14 percent range for further scrutiny. Some low rate-of-return investments such as those for environmental controls may be regulated and therefore offer no choice to management. Other investments appear to generate relatively low returns until the consequences of not investing is considered. Yet other investments do not fully incorporate the benefits to other products or services in rate-of-return calculations.

The financial flexibility needed to pursue currently unforeseen opportunities that may be more difficult to finance later is often another persuasive argument that moves CEOs to limit share repurchases. In the final analysis, a share repurchase, as is the case with any other market transaction, is a fine idea at the right price.

- In contrast to earlier chapters, where strategies were assessed on the basis of management forecasts, now our interest centers on what the price of the shares tell us about the market’s expectations concerning the company’s future performance. As will be demonstrated, estimating shareholder return potential requires insight into both corporate plans and the current assessment of these plans by the market as reflected in the current stock price. Chapters 4 and 5 established the link between the strategy formulation process and the shareholder value approach to assessing strategies. Throughout the discussion, it was emphasized that value would be created only if corporate investments were made at above the market-required rate of return, that is, the cost of capital. If the company successfully invests at above the cost of capital rate, will shareholders also earn a rate of return exceeding the cost of capital? The short answer to this question is that it depends on the expected level of performance implied by the stock price when the investor purchases the shares. This chapter will focus on a more detailed answer to this and related questions about corporate performance and shareholder returns. This analysis impacts major management issues such as the selection of hurdle rates for corporate investments and evaluation and the design of performance evaluation and executive compensation systems.

Moreover, CEOs contend that value is sensitive to different assumptions about the economy, the competitive dynamics of the industry, and the company’s strategic position. However, an increasing number of CEOs are beginning to realize that it is much ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1686))

- there is the “corporate return” or the rate of return that the company earns on its real investments. Second, there is the “shareholder return,” which is the rate of return shareholders earn on their investment in the company’s shares. The corporate return will exceed the cost of capital when the company successfully invests in value-creating opportunities. On the other hand, the shareholder return will exceed the cost of equity capital only if the company outperforms the expectations reflected in the company’s share price.

- To understand the difference between the corporate and shareholder rate of return, imagine a company with an expected annual cash flow of $100 into perpetuity, a cost of capital of 10 percent, and therefore a value of $1,000.

- With 100 shares outstanding, the price per share is $10. Now assume that the company wants to raise capital to fund a $10 investment that is expected to generate an additional $1.50 of annual cash flow. From the company’s perspective it will earn a 15 percent return on its $10 investment. In other words, the corporate return is 15 percent. If the company issues one additional share, the new shareholder will have a financial claim to 1/101 of the increased annual cash flow of $101.50, which is worth $10.05 per share at the 10 percent discount rate. At a $10 share price the new shareholder will earn marginally more than 10 percent on this investment. The market, however, is likely to bid the share price up to $10.05 and, if this materializes, the new shareholder will earn a return ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1742))

The only way in which the new shareholder will receive a return higher than the cost of capital is if the company unexpectedly generates greater cash flows and expectations are revised upward correspondingly. Market signals analysis can be used to estimate the corporate rate of return that management must achieve on new investments to justify the current share price. The process entails three steps. Step 1:Calculate the market capitalization of equity by multiplying the current share price by the number of shares outstanding. Step 2:Calculate annual operating cash flow after taxes from estimates of value drivers—sales growth, operating ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1747))

Solve for value growth duration, that is, the number of years it takes before the present value of the cash flows equals the current market value. Step 3:Calculate the corporate rate of return by discounting the capitalized value of NOPAT increases at the rate that sets their present value equal to the cumulative present value of incremental investments discounted at the cost of capital.2 ([Location 1751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=1751))

- To calculate present value, cash flows are discounted by the rate of return available to investors for investment alternatives with comparable risk. This cost of capital rate of return is referred commonly to as the “hurdle rate” in corporate capital budgeting systems.

- along the lines described in Chapter 3 as hurdle rates for capital budgeting decisions. Recall that if the stock market expected the company to invest at the cost of capital or hurdle rate, the shares would be priced at their baseline value. When the company’s shares are priced above the baseline value, the market is signaling its expectation that the company will have opportunities to invest at above the hurdle rate. In this situation, investment at only the hurdle rate level will presumably lead to a lowering of expectations and will not enable present shareholders to earn their required rate of return.

Unfortunately, a low price/earnings ratio is no sign of a bargain if investors’ low expectations are warranted. I have developed another measure that goes further than the price/ earnings ratio in judging whether a stock is undervalued.3 I call it the expectations risk index, or ERI. The ERI answers two essential questions: First, how much of a stock’s price depends on future value-creating growth? Second, how difficult will it be to achieve that growth. Consider a stock trading at $100 per share. Assume the company’s operating cash flow before growth investment is $4 per share.

- the present value of its current operating cash flow level, or its baseline value, is $32 per share. That means that $68, or 68 percent of the stock’s price, comes from investors’ expectations of future growth. Now, let’s take a close look at that future growth. Compare the company’s after-tax “cash” operating earnings for the past three years with Wall Street estimates for the next three years. Suppose cash earnings were $100 million in 1993 and $120 million in 1996, while Wall Street projects $180 for 1999. Historic growth was 1.20, future growth is projected to be 1.50. Therefore, the ratio of expected future growth to recent growth is 1.25. Whenever the ratio is greater than 1.0, Wall Street expects growth to be accelerating from historical levels. Call this the acceleration ratio. To calculate the ERI, multiply the portion of the stock’s price that is due to growth expectations (in this case, 0.68) by the acceleration ratio (in this case, 1.25). The answer, 0.85, is the ERI. The lower the ERI, the greater the chance of achieving expectations and the higher the expected return for the investor. The LEK/Alcar Consulting Group performed an initial test of ERI on communication technology stocks, and Michael Mauboussin of Credit Suisse First Boston tested it on food stocks. The three years 1991-1993 were used as the historic period and 1994-1996 as the forecast period. The stocks in the lowest quartile of ERIs at the end of 1993 earned an average annual return of 71 percent in communications technology, compared with 24.1 percent for all other stocks in that group. In foods, the lowest quartile of ERIs returned 27 percent, compared with 17.5 percent for the others. Had investors used price/earnings ratios instead of ERI, they would… ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBJHHG&location=2973))
