## Highlights
- The game plan you need to follow to implement this strategy is simple:   1. Identify businesses that can generate above-average profits for many years. 2. Wait until the shares of those businesses trade for less than their intrinsic ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=179))

- value, and then buy. 3. Hold those shares until either the business deteriorates, the shares become overvalued, or you find a better investment. This holding period should be measured in years, not months. 4. Repeat as necessary. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=182))

- A company that can generate high returns on its capital for many years will compound wealth at a very prodigious clip.1 Companies that can do this are not common, however, because high returns on capital attract competitors like bees to honey. That’s how capitalism works, after all—money seeks the areas of highest expected return, which means that competition quickly arrives at the doorstep of a company with fat profits. So in general, returns on capital are what we call “mean-reverting.” In other words, companies with high returns see them dwindle as competition moves in, and companies with low returns see them improve as either they move into new lines of business or their competitors leave the playing field. But some companies are able to withstand the relentless onslaught of competition for long periods of time, and these are the wealth-compounding machines that can form the bedrock of your portfolio. For example, think about companies like Anheuser-Busch, Oracle, and Johnson & Johnson—they’re all extremely profitable and have faced intense competitive threats for many years, yet they still crank out very high returns on capital. Maybe they just got lucky, or (more likely) maybe those firms have some special characteristics that most companies lack. How can you identify companies like these—ones that not only are great today, but are likely to stay great for many years ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=192))

- into the future? You ask a deceptively simple question about the companies in which you plan to invest: “What prevents a smart, well-financed competitor from moving in on this company’s turf?” ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=205))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To answer this question, look for specific structural characteristics called competitive advantages or economic moats. Just as moats around medieval castles kept the opposition at bay, economic moats protect the high returns on capital enjoyed by the world’s best companies. If you can identify companies that have moats and you can purchase their shares at reasonable prices, you’ll build a portfolio of wonderful businesses that will greatly improve your odds of doing well in the stock market. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=206))

- Also, if you are right about the moat, your odds of permanent capital impairment—that is, irrevocably losing a ton of money on your investment—decline considerably. Companies with moats are more likely to reliably increase their intrinsic value over time, so if you wind up buying their shares at a valuation that (in hindsight) is somewhat high, the growth in intrinsic value will protect your investment returns. Companies without moats are more likely to suffer sharp, sudden decreases in their intrinsic value when they hit competitive speed bumps, and that means you’ll want to pay less for their shares. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=261))
    - Tags: [[sustainable competitive advantage]] 
- Finally, moats can help you define what is called a “circle of competence.” Most investors do better if they limit their investing to an area they know well—financialservices firms, for example, or tech stocks—rather than trying to cast too broad a net. Instead of becoming an expert in a set of industries, why not become an expert in firms with competitive advantages, regardless of what business they are in? You’ll limit a vast and unworkable investment universe to a smaller one composed of high-quality firms that you can understand well.

- Buying a share of stock means that you own a tiny—okay, really tiny—piece of the business. 2. The value of a business is equal to all the cash it will generate in the future. 3. A business that can profitably generate cash for a long time is worth more today than a business that may be profitable only for a short time. 4. Return on capital is the best way to judge a company’s profitability. It measures how good a company is at taking ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=289))

- THERE’S A COMMON CANARD in investing that runs, “Bet on the jockey, not on the horse”—the notion is that the quality of a management team matters more than the quality of a business. I suppose that in horse racing it makes sense. After all, racing horses are bred and trained to run ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=302))

- fast, and so the playing field among horses seems relatively level. I may be on thin ice here, having never actually been to a horse race, but I think it’s fair to say that mules and Shetland ponies don’t race against thoroughbreds. The business world is different. In the stock market, mules and Shetland ponies do race against thoroughbreds, and the best jockey in the world can’t do much if his mount is only weeks from being put out to pasture. By contrast, even an inexperienced jockey would likely do better than average riding a horse that had won the Kentucky Derby. As an investor, your job is to focus on the horses, not the jockeys. Why? Because the single most important thing to remember about moats is that they are structural characteristics of a business that are likely to persist for a number of years, and that would be very hard for a ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=304))

- In my experience, the most common “mistaken moats” are great products, strong market share, great execution, and great management. These four traps can lure you into thinking that a company has a moat when the odds are good that it actually doesn’t.

- To be fair, it is occasionally possible to take the success of a blockbuster product or service and leverage it into an economic moat. Look at Hansen Natural, which markets the Monster brand of energy drinks that surged onto the market in the early part of this decade. Rather than resting on its laurels, Hansen used Monster’s success to secure a long-term distribution agreement with beverage giant Anheuser-Busch, giving it an advantage over competitors in the energy-drink market. Anyone who wants to compete with Monster now has to overcome Hansen’s distribution advantage. Is this impossible to do? Of course not, because Pepsi and Coke have their own distribution networks. But it does help protect Hansen’s profit stream by making it harder for the next upstart energy drink to get in front of consumers, and that’s the essence of an economic moat. What about a company that has had years of success, and is now a very large player in its industry?

- with large market shares must have economic moats, right? Unfortunately, bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to digging an economic moat. It is very easy to assume that a company with high market share has a sustainable competitive advantage—how else would it have grabbed a big chunk of the market?—but history shows us that leadership can be fleeting in highly competitive markets. Kodak (film), IBM (PCs), Netscape (Internet browsers), General Motors (automobiles), and Corel (word processing software) are only a few of the firms that have discovered this. In each of these cases, a dominant firm ceded significant market share to one or more challengers because it failed to build—or maintain—a moat around its business. So, the question to ask is not whether a firm has high market share, but rather how the ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=357))

- So, size can help a company create a competitive advantage—more on this in Chapter 7—but it is rarely the source of an economic moat by itself. Likewise, high market share is not necessarily a moat. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=372))

- What about operational efficiency, often labeled as “great execution”? Some companies are praised for being good at blocking and tackling, and experience shows that some companies manage to achieve goals more reliably than competitors do. Isn’t running a tight ship a competitive advantage? Sadly, no—absent some structural competitive advantage, it’s not enough to be more efficient than one’s competitors. In fact, if a company’s success seems to be based on being leaner and meaner than its peers, odds are good that it operates in ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=374))

- are all unreliable signs of an economic moat, what should you look for? Here’s your list: • A company can have intangible assets, like brands, patents, or regulatory licenses that allow it to sell products or services that can’t be matched by competitors. • The products or services that a company sells may be hard for customers to give up, which creates customer switching costs that give the firm pricing power. • Some lucky companies benefit from network economics, which is a very powerful type of economic moat that can lock out competitors for a long time. • Finally, some companies have cost advantages, stemming from process, location, scale, or access to a unique asset, which allow them to offer goods or services at a lower cost than competitors.

The four sources of structural competitive advantage are intangible assets, customer switching costs, the network effect, and cost advantages. If you can find a company with solid returns on capital and one of these characteristics, you’ve likely found a company with a moat.

- “INTANGIBLE ASSETS” sounds like a grab-bag category for competitive advantage, and in some ways it is. On the surface, brands, patents, and regulatory licenses have little in common. But as economic moats, they all function in essentially the same way—by establishing a unique position in the marketplace. Any company with one of these advantages has a mini-monopoly, allowing it to extract a lot of value from its customers. The flip side is that moats based on intangible assets may not be as easy to spot as you think. Brands can lose their luster, patents can be challenged, and licenses can be revoked by the same government that granted them. Let’s tackle brands first.

- One of the most common mistakes investors make concerning brands is assuming that a well-known brand endows its owner with a competitive advantage. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.

- only if it increases the consumer’s willingness to pay or increases customer captivity. After all, brands cost money to build and sustain, and if that investment doesn’t generate a return via some pricing power or repeat business, then it’s not creating a competitive advantage. The next time you are looking at a company with a well-known consumer brand—or one that argues that its brand is valuable within a certain market niche—ask whether the company is able to charge a premium relative to similar competing products. If not, the brand may not be worth very much. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=453))

- The bottom line is that brands can create durable competitive advantages, but the popularity of the brand matters much less than whether it actually affects consumers’ behavior. If consumers will pay more for a product—or purchase it with regularity—solely because of the brand, you have strong evidence of a moat. But there are plenty of well-known brands attached to products and companies that struggle to earn positive economic returns.

- In general, it pays to be wary of any firm that relies on a small number of patented products for its profits, as any challenge to those patents will severely harm the company and will probably be very hard to predict. The only time patents constitute a truly sustainable competitive advantage is when the firm has a demonstrated track record of innovation that you’re confident can continue, as well as a wide variety of patented products. Think of 3M, which has ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=512))

- In short, if you can find a company that can price like a monopoly without being regulated like one, you’ve probably found a company with a wide economic moat. The bond-rating industry is a great example of lever-aging a regulatory advantage into a near-monopolistic position. In order to provide ratings for bonds issued in the United States, a company has to be granted the designation of “Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization.” So, right away, any potential competitor to the incumbents knows that it will need to undergo an onerous regulatory inspection if it wants to compete in this industry. It should come as no surprise, then, that companies that rate bonds are fantastically profitable. Moody’s Investors Service, for instance, sports operating margins north ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=529))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- of 50 percent (not a typo), and returns on capital of around 150 percent. But you don’t need to rate bonds to enjoy a strong competitive advantage based on a regulatory approval. Look at the slot machine industry—about as far from the staid business of bonds as you could imagine. As you might expect, slots are heavily regulated to ensure that the machines don’t give casinos any more than the legally mandated advantage, and to keep unscrupulous people from rigging the machines for their personal gain. It’s not easy to get approval to manufacture and sell slot machines, and losing this approval can be financially devastating. One of the industry’s smaller players, WMS Industries, temporarily lost regulatory approval in 2001 after a software glitch, and it took the firm three years to recover to its preglitch profit level.

- can dig an equally wide moat. My favorite example of this is what I call the NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) companies, such as waste haulers and aggregate producers. After all, who wants a landfill or stone quarry located in their neighborhood? Almost no one, which means that existing landfills and stone quarries are extremely valuable. As such, getting new ones approved is close to impossible. Trash and gravel may not sound exciting, but the moat created by scores of mini-approvals is very durable. After all, companies like trash haulers and aggregate firms rely on hundreds of municipal-level approvals that are unlikely to disappear overnight en masse. What really makes these locally approved landfills and quarries so valuable for companies like Waste Management and ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=555))

- Vulcan Materials is that waste and gravel are inherently local businesses. You can’t profitably dump trash hundreds of miles from where it is collected, and you can’t truck aggregates much farther than 40 or 50 miles from a quarry without pricing yourself out of the market. (Trash is heavy, and gravel is even heavier.) So, local approvals for landfills and quarries create scores of mini-moats in these industries. Contrast waste and gravel with another industry that has strong NIMBY characteristics—refining. Although there hasn’t been a new refinery built in the United States for decades, and local approvals for expansions of existing refineries are pretty tough to come by, the economic situation… ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=563))

- Although intangible assets may be just that—I can’t haul a brand or patent off a shelf and show it to you—they can be extremely valuable as sources of competitive advantage. They key in assessing intangible assets is thinking about how much value they can create for a company, and how long they are likely to last. A well-known brand that doesn’t confer pricing power or promote customer captivity is not a competitive advantage, no matter how familiar people may be with it. And a regulatory approval that doesn’t create high returns on capital—think refiners—isn’t all that valuable. Finally, a patent portfolio that is too vulnerable to legal challenge, perhaps because it’s not diversified, or perhaps because the company has nothing in the pipeline as a follow-up, doesn’t constitute much of a moat.

- Now, I’m sure that you know why banks are basically licenses to print money. The average bank in the United States earns a return on equity of around 15 percent, a level of profitability that is clearly above average for just about any other kind of company. There are lots of reasons for this, but one of the biggest is that bank customers incur a switching cost if they want to move ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=609))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- from one bank to another. Plainly speaking, moving your bank account is a royal pain, so people don’t do it all that often. Banks know this, so they take advantage of their customers’ reluctance to leave by giving them a bit less interest and charging them somewhat higher fees than they would if moving a bank account were as easy as driving from one filling station to another. As you can see, switching costs are a valuable competitive advantage because a company can extract more money out of its customers if those customers are unlikely to move to a competitor. You find switching costs when the benefit of changing from Company A’s product to Company B’s product is smaller than the cost of doing so.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What about the benefits of switching? Maybe the competition’s program is somewhat cheaper, or maybe it has some features that QuickBooks lacks. But basic accounting is about 500 years old (give or take), so it’s not terribly likely that a new bookkeeping program could revolutionize the way a small business keeps track of its finances. Weighing both sides, it’s hard to see how the benefits of switching could outweigh the costs—which is why Intuit has dominated the market for years, and will likely continue to dominate it.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- analogous to those of banks. Money that flows into a mutual fund or wealth-management account tends to stay there—we call these sticky assets—and that money generates fees for many years. For example, during the market-timing scandals in the mutual fund world, even when some asset management firms were caught doing blatantly illegal things, most retained enough assets to remain solidly profitable, despite legal costs and investor redemptions. Although the explicit cost of moving a mutual fund account from Firm A to Firm B is arguably even lower than moving a bank account, most people perceive the benefits as uncertain. They have to convince themselves that the new and less familiar manager will be better than the manager they have been using, which ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=692))

- essentially means admitting they made a mistake choosing their current manager in the first place. This is psychologically tough for most people, so assets tend to stay where they are. The switching costs may not be explicitly large, but the benefits of switching are so uncertain that most people take the path of least resistance and just stay where they are.

- packaged-goods companies, and the like. That’s because low switching costs are the main weakness of these kinds of companies. You can walk from one clothing store to another, or choose a different brand of toothpaste at the grocery store, with almost no effort whatsoever. That makes it very hard for retailers and restaurants to create moats around their businesses. Some, like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, can do it through economies of scale, and some, like Coach, can create moats by building strong brands—but in general, consumer-oriented firms often suffer from low switching costs.

Businesses that benefit from the network effect are very similar; that is, the value of their product or service increases with the number of users. This may sound incredibly simple, but it’s actually fairly unusual. Think about your favorite restaurant. That business delivers value to you by providing good food at a reasonable price. It likely doesn’t matter much to you whether the place is crowded or empty, and in fact, you’d probably prefer it to be not terribly crowded. The value of the service is almost completely independent of how many other people use it. Now think about some well-known large companies, like the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for example.

The rewards and perks that Amex offers users help it to compete with other credit cards, but if its cards weren’t accepted at millions of places where people want to spend money, Amex could offer triple the level of rewards and still have a tiny number of users. That huge network of merchants is what gives Amex a competitive advantage over any other company that may want to start up a new credit card. The more places you can use your Amex card, the more valuable that card becomes to you, which is a big reason behind the company’s recent push to get Amex accepted at smaller merchants like convenience stores and gas stations.

- Now think about how many large credit card networks there are in the United States. The top four—Visa, MasterCard, Amex, and Discover—account for 85 percent of all spending on credit cards nationwide. That’s a huge amount of market concentration, and it illustrates a fundamental reason why the network effect can be an extremely powerful competitive advantage: Network-based businesses tend to create natural monopolies and oligopolies. As economist and academic Brian Arthur has succinctly put it, “Of networks, there will be few.” This makes a lot of sense. If the value of a good or service increases with the number of people using it, then the most valuable network-based products will be the ones that attract the most users, creating a virtuous circle that squeezes out smaller networks and increases the size of dominant ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=792))

- networks. And as the dominant networks get bigger, they also get stronger. That sounds like a pretty powerful competitive advantage. But of course, the very nature of the network effect means that there won’t be a very large number of businesses that benefit from it, given the propensity of networks to consolidate around the leader.

- Credit cards have been around for only a few decades, after all, and the PC industry is even younger. As you look for network-based businesses, you’ll find this is not a fluke—the network effect is much more common among businesses based on information or knowledge transfer than among businesses based on physical capital. This is the case because information is what economists call a “nonrival” good. Most goods can be used by only one person at a time—if I buy a big earthmover from Caterpillar, no one else can use it while I’m excavating a foundation. (These types of things are called “rival” goods.) But I can use the Amex payment network at the same time as millions of other cardholders, in the same way that all those cardholders could use the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the same time to find out how much some shares of American Express ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=818))

- would cost. One person’s use of the Amex network or the NYSE does not impede the ability of others to use those networks—and in fact, the more people who use these networks, the more valuable they are to others. The bottom line is that you’re most likely to find the network effect in businesses based on sharing information, or connecting users together, rather than in businesses that deal in rival (physical) goods. As we’ll see later in the chapter, this is not exclusively the case, but it’s a good rule of thumb. By this point, I imagine that you have a good idea of why network effects are such a powerful competitive advantage: A competing firm would need to replicate the network—or at least come close—before users would see more value in the new network and switch away from the existing one.

At one point a few years ago, eBay operated the largest online auction site in China, with about a 90 percent share of traffic. However, a home-grown competitor emerged, slashed its listing fees to zero, and introduced some features that were particularly attractive to the Chinese market. EBay lost market share very swiftly, and eventually retreated from the market.

The mechanics of the network effect for a financial exchange are simple: As more buyers and sellers aggregate on an exchange, exchange participants are increasingly able to find the asset they want at the price they want. In financial parlance, more buyers and sellers lead to greater liquidity. This liquidity can be broad, meaning that participants transact in a wide range of assets, and it can be deep, meaning that participants can trade a large volume of assets without affecting the quoted price.

Although an Intel chip is certainly different from an AMD chip, they both do pretty much the same thing from a user perspective, and whichever one has the best price-performance ratio is most likely to get the nod from buyers.

It’s worth understanding why that often takes a fair amount of time, during which the originator of the low-cost process can make a lot of money. I won’t beat a very dead horse by going over the process-based cost advantages enjoyed by Dell and low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines. We’ve all heard both stories a million times.

- seats at far lower costs than the competition, but why they were allowed to essentially run away with their respective markets when their low-cost processes were a matter of public record. The answers are different in each case, but they are instructive nonetheless. In Southwest’s case, the incumbent airlines (the majors) didn’t copy its low-cost process for a number of reasons. First, a rigid union structure meant that pilots weren’t about to start helping clean planes at the incumbents. Second, Southwest’s point-to-point route structure would have made it hard for the majors to feed profitable business and international passengers through their expensively maintained hubs. Third, Southwest was an aggressively egalitarian airline—no separate classes, no assigned seats—in an industry that made a lot of money by treating some passengers like royalty and charging them for the privilege. In short, the majors would have had to figuratively blow up their businesses to gain Southwest’s cost advantage, and it’s hard to blow up your own business. However, this does not answer why none of the dozens of other upstart airlines succeeded the way Southwest did. Partly, this was because Southwest had already locked up slots at second-tier airports, and partly it was because Southwest had the foresight to lock up a continuous supply of new planes, which have much lower operating costs than used planes. But an equally important reason was that Southwest gained sufficient scale before the majors realized it was much of a threat—and by that time, it was too big to kill. Subsequent start-ups were strangled in their cradles by incumbents that aggressively cut prices on the newcomers’ routes, and since the newcomers started with only a few routes, they couldn’t withstand the losses for long and folded. Incumbent PC makers left Dell alone for the same reason that the majors initially gave Southwest a pass: The resellers and retailers that took PCs from the manufacturers to the end user were too vital a link in the… ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=996))

From 2002 to 2007, Kodak earned only about $800 million in cumulative operating income, an 85 percent decline from its cumulative operating profits for the previous five years. Whether Kodak can eventually succeed in digital photography is still an open question, but the economics of short product-cycle consumer electronics look tougher than the slow-moving but highly profitable business of selling celluloid, paper, and chemicals that Kodak enjoyed in the past. Newspapers were once some of the best businesses in the world, reliably throwing off massive cash flows through their lock on local news, advertising, and classifieds.

And—also like more than a few wide-moat businesses—Microsoft chose to take that cash and use it to create and expand businesses in which its competitive advantage was much weaker. Microsoft is so ridiculously profitable that this misuse of cash did not drag overall returns on capital down to an unattractive level, but that’s not the case for every company. For less profitable companies, no-moat investments can hurt returns on capital enough ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1320))

- to make the entire corporation less attractive as an investment. You may be asking what Microsoft should have done with all that cash flow it didn’t need to keep expanding and improving Windows. Well, the company did use some to expand into complementary areas that have succeeded, such as database software and operating systems for servers. It should have just given the rest back to shareholders as a dividend, a vastly underutilized tool for allocating capital efficiently. A company can fill in its own moat by investing heavily in areas in which it has no competitive advantage. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1324))

- As physicist and philosopher Niels Bohr once said, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.” Yet that’s exactly what we need to do when assessing the durability of a company’s competitive advantage. But sometimes the future throws you a curve ball, and that’s when you need to reassess whether a company’s moat is still intact or the unexpected turn of events has done permanent damage to the company’s competitive advantage.

- The Bottom Line   1. Technological change can destroy competitive advantages, but this is a bigger worry for companies that are enabled by technology than it is for companies that sell technology, because the effects can be more unexpected. 2. If a company’s customer base becomes more concentrated, or if a competitor has goals other than making money, the moat may be in danger. 3. Growth is not always good. It’s better for a company to make lots of money doing what it is good at, and give the excess back to shareholders, than it is to throw the excess profits at a questionable line of business with no moat. Microsoft could get away with it, but most companies can’t. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1349))

- Turning to asset management, Morningstar covers 18 publicly traded asset managers, all of which have economic moats. (In fact, a dozen have wide moats, while the rest have narrow moats.)4 Although the barriers to entry are low in asset management—anyone willing to spend $100,000 or so on lawyers and registration fees can start a mutual fund—the barriers to success are quite high, because it generally takes a large distribution network to really rake in the assets. However, those assets tend to stick around once they’re in the door, which means that money managers that have amassed a good-sized pile of assets under management can generally generate high returns on capital without breaking much of a sweat.

In general, we’ve found that diversity and control of distribution channels help media companies create competitive advantage and a buffer against the inevitable loss of popularity of any individual media property. More so than many other sectors, however, many media companies are threatened with technological disruption as the Internet blows up well-established business models. Companies with extremely strong brands (Disney) or broad distribution networks (Comcast) seem like they will have the best chance of surviving with moats intact.

- Companies that cater directly to the consumer, like restaurants and retailers, often have a very hard time building competitive advantages—the percentage of consumer services companies with wide moats is one of the smallest of all the market sectors. The culprit here is low switching costs, because walking down the street from one shop or cafe to another is incredibly easy, and popular concepts can almost always be copied with ease. Popular fashion retailers or restaurant chains often present the illusion of a moat due to their fast growth and the buzz that surrounds a new type of store that is opening up several new locations every month, but be wary, because the odds are good that a ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1422))

- knockoff concept is not far off. The moats that do exist in consumer services—companies like Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Target, or Starbucks—are generally the result of getting a lot of little things consistently right for years, which results in the kind of dependable consumer experience that drives loyalty and repeat traffic. It can be done, but it’s not easy. Companies that provide services to businesses are in many ways the polar opposite of the restaurants and retailers. This sector has one of the highest percentages of wide-moat companies in Morningstar’s coverage universe, and that’s largely because these firms are often able to integrate themselves so tightly into their clients’ business processes that they create very high switching costs, giving them pricing power and excellent returns ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1426))

- I hope you understand by now that moats increase the value of companies by helping them stay profitable for a longer period of time. So, what is the best way to measure a company’s profitability? Easy—we look at how much profit the company is generating relative to the amount of money invested in the business. From a numbers perspective, this is the real key to separating great companies from average ones, because the job of any company is to take money and invest it in projects, products, or services to generate more money. The more capital that comes out relative to the amount that goes in, the better the ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1492))

More efficient capital users are going to be better businesses—and better investments—because they can increase shareholder wealth at a faster compound rate.

- Think about it this way. A company’s management is similar to the management of a mutual fund. A mutual fund manager takes investors’ money and invests it in stocks or bonds to generate a return, and a manager who is able to generate, say, 12 percent returns is going to increase shareholders’ wealth faster than a manager who can compound at only 8 percent. Companies aren’t much different. They take shareholders’ money and invest it in their own businesses to create wealth. By measuring the return that a company has achieved, we know how good it is at efficiently transforming capital into profits. So, how do we measure return on capital? The three most common ways are return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on invested capital (ROIC). Each gives us the same information, but in a slightly different way. Return on assets (ROA) measures how much income a company generates per dollar of assets, and if all companies were… ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1499))

- company that can consistently generate an ROA of 7 percent or so likely has some kind of competitive advantage over its peers. But many firms are at least partially financed with debt, which gives their returns on capital a leverage component that we need to take into account. Enter return on equity (ROE), which is also a great overall measure of returns on capital. ROE measures the efficiency with which a company uses shareholders’ equity—think of it as measuring profits per dollar of shareholders’ capital. One flaw of ROE is that companies can take on a lot of debt and boost their ROE without becoming more profitable, so it’s a good… ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1509))

- a very broad rule of thumb, you might use 15 percent as a reasonable cutoff—companies that can consistently crank out ROEs of 15 percent or better are more likely than not to have economic moats. Finally, there’s return on invested capital (ROIC), which combines the best of both worlds. It measures the return on all capital invested in the firm, regardless of whether it is equity or debt. So, it incorporates debt—unlike ROA—but removes the distortion that can make highly leveraged companies look very profitable using ROE. It also uses a different definition of profits that helps remove any effects caused by a company’s… ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=1515))

- The obvious one is that the business media need to attract an audience, and CEOs are an easy subject. Who wouldn’t want to read a story about the CEO of a Fortune 500 company that is posting record profits, or watch an interview with an executive about a company’s successful international expansion strategy? The executives are typically happy to have the publicity, and the business reporter is happy to oblige by writing a topical story about a company of interest. It’s a win-win for both parties, but it’s often a disservice to investors who get the idea that these executives control the fate of their companies the way a star chef controls the output of his or her kitchen.

- The insidious reason that managers get so much attention as the arbiters of corporate fate is that we are all biased. It’s inherent in human nature to want to tell stories and see patterns that may not actually exist—we feel better when we can identify a cause for every effect that we observe, and identifying the causal agent as a single person is infinitely more satisfying than blaming a “lack of competitive advantage.” The truth of the matter, though, is that CEOs have a hard time either creating a competitive advantage where it doesn’t exist or damaging a competitive advantage that is very strong to begin with.
