## Highlights
- “It is clear that human psychology plays a major role in the fields of economics, finance, and investments. Until reading Moods and Markets, I considered the most fascinating and promising fields of investing to be socioeconomics, behavioral economics, and behavioral finance. But now it may well be socionomics, which takes these concepts to an entirely new and unique level. Atwater writes a lucid, compelling, and engagingly accessible treatise on the topic, supported by many salient historical and real time examples. Most importantly, he illustrates tangible ways to identify social mood dynamics and to both minimize risk and make gains based on them. A must read for every investor and fiduciary.” ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=44))

- form the foundation of investing success: fundamental analysis, technical analysis, risk management, and mass psychology/investor sentiment. Mass psychology and investor sentiment are the least understood but increasingly important determinants of market direction, particularly at important inflection points in social mood. Peter’s insightful book articulates new ways of assessing the markets from this lens and is a very useful guide to investors who are looking for an edge to enhance their portfolio returns.” ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=77))

Social mood and risk appetites shape financial assets; it’s a subtle, but extremely critical distinction. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the ‘why’ rather than the ‘what’ as we prepare ourselves with a forward and proactive lens.” ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=86))

- The central idea of Moods and Markets is the Horizon Preference Model. This idea has aged roots. When I first went to work for the Market Analysis Department at Merrill Lynch in 1975, its chief, Robert Farrell, handed me just one short book to read: One-Way Pockets. This insightful investigation into clients’ behavior by pseudonymous stock broker Don Guyon was published nearly a full century ago, in 1917. Wondering why his clients had lost money over a multi-month stock-market cycle even though prices ended up where they had begun, Guyon pulled out all his clients’ buy and sell tickets and came to a startling realization: The fact that impressed me most forcibly was that the trading methods of each had undergone a pronounced and obviously unintentional change with the progress of the bull market from one stage to another. As later investigation showed this tendency to be general, it may be classed with a number of psychological phenomena that cause a great majority of speculators to do the direct opposite of what they ought to do.... The customer who three months ago had been eager to take a point profit on 100 shares of stock would not take ten points on 1,000 shares of the same stock now that it had doubled in price.1 In other words, when the bull market was young, Guyon’s clients saw profits as ephemeral, and when the bull market was aged, they envisioned profits extending forever. Atwater has expanded this timeless observation into a broader truism applicable to all social passions. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=267))

- Socionomics proposes that social mood changes are unconscious. Guyon said that investors’ change of outlook was “obviously unintentional.” Atwater demonstrates that people’s changing time horizons are unconscious, unintentional, and often the counterproductive consequences of changing trends in social mood. He shows that when time horizons change, behavior changes. His key words—“me, here, now” versus “us, everywhere, forever”—provide excellent referents for interpreting social mood. In 1927, Cambridge economist Arthur Pigou proposed that the macroeconomy fluctuates between extremes due to society’s tendency continually to fall prey to an “error of optimism” followed by an “error of pessimism.” Atwater ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=279))

- updates Pigou by characterizing these psychological extremes as “hopeful delusion” and “fearful delusion.” I agree, because people don’t simply make stupid mistakes time and again. They repeatedly delude themselves and each other, because shifts in unconscious mood powerfully impel changes in levels of confidence and even in beliefs. One of Atwater’s observations is that sometimes the emotional content of media headlines expresses public mood two or three days ahead of stock market changes. This is what Johan Bollen and Huina Mao found in their breakthrough study of emotional states implied… ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=285))

- or hours; but it may ultimately prove to have a bit longer lag. Atwater goes his own way in a few areas. I have listed confidence or its lack—which probably derives from unconscious imperatives to increase sustenance and avoid risk—as one of the manifestations of positive social mood, not a synonym for it. But changes in confidence surely belong among the most important… ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=291))

- “Why,” particularly in the world of investing, is a very lonely place. Most analysts and research firms are so focused on “immediately actionable” buy and sell recommendations and the onslaught of quarterly earnings that they can barely keep up with the “who,” “what,” and “when” of an industry. Few have time for “how,” and even fewer have the energy to figure out “why.” ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=306))

- As the markets moved dramatically higher in 2009, my continued pessimistic outlook drew increasing skepticism. In the eyes of the market and my clients, western governments and central bankers had saved the day. Policymakers did what policymakers always do, they put a floor on market prices and the economy rebounded. We had learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression and an economic collapse had been averted. What could have been The Second Great Depression had been successfully mitigated to just The Great Recession. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=334))

- Unfortunately nothing I read made sense to me, at least not in explaining the chronology of events and the extreme outcome that I still foresaw. That changed in November 2009, when I saw an interview with Bob Prechter, the president of Elliott Wave International, by Kevin Depew on Minyanville.com.2 Beginning in the summer of 2007, I had been (and still am) a contributor to Minyanville, and I often found Kevin’s take on the markets to be at odds with my own. He was optimistic where I only saw gloom, and he was pessimistic when I saw opportunity. Kevin attributed a lot of his self-admitted contrarian perspective to what he had learned from Bob. And Kevin’s enthusiasm ahead of his interview with Bob was palpable. He was like a guitar fan finally having the chance to sit down with Carlos Santana or Eddie Van Halen. What I heard in Kevin’s interview with Bob, though, went against everything I had learned in economics and thought I had witnessed in the markets—that social mood, something I had never before even considered as a possible causal factor, drove the direction of the markets and not the reverse—that the S&P 500 is to social mood what a thermometer is to temperature or a… ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=344))

- Moving From “Why” to “How” While Bob and others at the Socionomics Institute helped me to see the linkages of mood to specific outcomes and consequences, I struggled with how it was that mood could actually drive them. I could not “see” the transmission mechanism. And without that I could not determine how what had happened with mortgages and banking could or even would apply to countries. This frustration led me to look more specifically at how changes in our mood affect our decision-making processes and what we believe to be logical choices across a broad spectrum of different moods. I tried to figure out why, for example, we bought homes eagerly at the peak of the market, yet with record low mortgage rates and record housing affordability, we only want to rent them today. What follows are my findings. My goal in writing this book is to share the insights and conclusions I have come to thanks to the framework of socionomics. I hope to help investors see what I now see in the markets and in the world around us and to prosper from it.

- Before moving on to Chapter 1, “Understanding Social Mood,” though, I want to pause and put right on the table the fundamental question of “causation” and the idea that changes in mood naturally “cause” us to do things we didn’t even know we were going to do. To be perfectly clear, when I first started looking at socionomics, not only did I not believe it, I didn’t want to believe it. As I offered earlier, the idea that changes in mood could move the market higher or lower ran counter to everything I thought I had witnessed in my 25 years in the financial services industry. There was no way socionomics could be right. Today I firmly believe mood drives the market. In the chapters ahead, I explain why.

- From watching CNBC or reading The Wall Street Journal, it would be easy to conclude that it is the economy or corporate earnings that move the market. On any given day you might hear that stocks rose on a better than expected employment figure, while on another day stocks’ fall is attributed to a drop in profitability at Research in Motion or some other company. Something had to make the market go up or down, and there are plenty of confident pundits and journalists ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=411))

- mood, particularly our collective, or social, mood. To do that, I first want to start with mood at an individual level. At the risk of over-simplicity, I think of our own individual mood as our underlying confidence. It is how sure we feel, often unknowingly, about ourselves and the world around us. But please appreciate that confidence is an entirely forward-looking measure. Although our level of confidence at any moment exists in the present, confidence is in fact all about the future and how certain or uncertain we are, not only about what we believe is… ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=425))

- is because the word ties together what I think of as the two critical elements of mood: a measure of certainty (or lack thereof) and our own belief system—what we think or feel is right at a specific moment in time—both assessed in a forward-looking manner. And it is that forward-looking element that is vital to mood’s usefulness to an investor. While our mood can and will be shaped by events from the past, it is how we apply those events to our outlook (through our hypotheses/predictions/strategies) that is critical. And as you will see, this allows us at different times to both under-and overestimate risk without necessarily realizing it. It also enables us to react differently to what is arguably the same… ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=436))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I also like the word “confidence” as a synonym for “social mood” because confidence has the same forward-looking aspect as equity values. That is to say, we value a stock today not on what is happening today within a company, but what we believe will happen in the future. I come back to this point in Chapter 2, “Horizon Preference: How Mood Affects Our Decision Making,” but please consider here how naturally aligned stock values and our level of confidence are.

- Emotions tend to be much more short term in nature than mood. Our emotions are often shaped by specific events, whereas mood tends to shape the events themselves. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=459))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With all that said, there are moments when mood and emotion are seemingly indistinguishable. Those moments tend to be at the extreme turning points of mood. (I come back to this topic in Chapters 3, “Market Peaks and All the Red Flags They Wave,” and 6, “Signs of a Bottom in Social Mood”). I think this is one of the reasons why investors repeatedly make the wrong investment decisions at critical turns in the market. At the top, for example, we miss the coincidence of strong positive mood and strong positive emotions (such as joy, love, peace) because of our extreme confidence about what is ahead. Likewise, on days like 9/11 it is all but impossible for us to separate very negative emotions, such as tragedy and sadness, from an extreme level of uncertainty. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=465))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Confidence and Our Perceptions of Certainty There is another related aspect to mood that I think is also worth considering, and that is the fact that our mood/confidence level and our certainty about the future are highly correlated. That is to say that the greater our own level of confidence, the more certain we are as to what we think the future will hold. Interestingly, too, the greater our confidence, the more into that future we think we can see our own version of that future as well. Put another way, when we are confident we think we know what is ahead, and when we are really confident we think we know what is ahead for a very long time to come. Companies, for example, routinely overinvest at the top in manufacturing capacity because they are certain of strong demand well into the future. The net result for most people resembles Figure 1.1, in which there is a near-perfect correlation between our level of confidence and our level of certainty of the future world around us.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The reality, however, is that the future is in no way correlated to our level of confidence. The future is going to be what it is going to be whether we are confident about it or not. Although our preparation and attitude might improve our ability to cope with what the future holds, as much as we may want—and at times truly believe—otherwise, our level of confidence… ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=481))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To me this is an important element of mood—particularly for investors—because, as Figure 1.2 suggests, it introduces the clear potential for us to over- and underestimate what is ahead due to changes in our level of confidence. I’ve come to think of this as our “hopeful delusion” when our mood rises and our “fearful delusion” when our mood falls. But as if that weren’t bad enough, the more positive or negative our mood, the more we are naturally inclined (for better and for worse) to extrapolate those delusions into the future. Take one look at analyst earnings estimates and price targets at a major peak or trough of a stock and you’ll see precisely what I mean. Few groups fall victim to the extrapolation effects of “hopeful delusion” and “fearful delusion” as repeatedly as the equity analyst community. The more confident we are, the more into the future we think we can see and the more we extrapolate our current assessment of what we see as certain into future periods. And when our confidence and mood are extremely high, we naturally foresee great things ahead for some time to come. The opposite, however, is true as our level of confidence deteriorates. In those times, we do the reverse and extrapolate more and more negative outcomes further and further out as our mood drops. Without even realizing why it is the case, we see things as becoming more and more hopeless. I have no doubt, for example, that at the very bottom of the Great Depression most Americans… ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=488))

- When we are confident we believe that everything is predictable (and in fact, “positively” predictable). When we are not confident, things are unpredictable. “Hopeful delusion” is replaced by “fearful delusion” as our mood deteriorates.

- To me, it is enormously helpful in moments of market turbulence, for example, to be able to step back and to distinguish self-assured uncertainty from panic or even despondency and conversely at major peaks to separate “self-assured certainty” from “euphoria;” to split mood and mood’s related preferences and decision-making characteristics from the emotions we exhibit. By distinguishing between the cause and the effect, I think it is much easier to see euphoria (and the specific behaviors that naturally go along with it) as a real-time sign of peak self-assured certainty and a reason to sell, rather than an emotion into which one… ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=548))

- tide–like market movements up and down, but, more importantly, consistent liquidity and orderly market conditions at all points in the cycle in which to execute them as well. Needless to say, steep declines in confidence are likely to be accompanied by commensurately steep drops in market prices and market liquidity as market participants curtail their risk-taking as their own levels of confidence fall. But there is another aspect to the asymmetry of rising and falling mood that I think is also important: our seemingly insatiable desire for certainty itself. Would you buy an investment from someone who is not confident about that investment’s expected result? Would you take seriously the comments on Bloomberg or CNBC of a seemingly less-than-confident money manager? I strongly doubt it. In the investment world, as in other businesses and in politics, we associate greater and greater levels of self-confidence in others with more certain outcomes. But consider for a moment that, in the world of investing, rising confidence and rising prices go together. Not surprisingly, as a result, we actually want and purchase more, not less, of a stock or commodity the higher the price rises (although most people don’t realize this). As the greatest potential certainty for price appreciation is when the price of a stock is low, not high, investors routinely overpay for what they perceive to be a greater certainty.

- I’d note, though, that even our own moods are rarely ever truly our own. At both an individual and collective level, our moods reflect our own interconnectivity with the world around us. Your personal mood, for example, incorporates the mood of your family, your work associates, members of your church, your book club, and so on. Your partner’s mood picks up his or her network of family, friends, and professional and social affiliations. Together your collective mood, as a couple, folds in elements of them all. I like to think of all of these social interconnection points as mood mirrors. Sometimes these mirrors reflect your ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=582))

- herds’ mood on you, and at other times these mirrors reflect your mood on them. Like it or not, though, your mood reflects the mood of the various herds you run with. You share their beliefs and they yours, and together, through an iterative and interactive process, your underlying mood is shaped and your brain then chooses a course of action that you believe is best. That is how mood is formed for each of us, and how ultimately social mood comes together in aggregate. It is not just the sum of the parts, but the sum of the interactions (and re-interactions) of the parts that drive mood. As noted in the Introduction, socionomists have deduced from the evidence that social mood is a natural product of human interaction and our natural herding instinct. As one who watches the interplay of social mood and the markets, I can say that nowhere does this iterative process become clearer than in the formations and re-formations of various “consensus trades”—where investors go from sharing one clear belief in what security or strategy will outperform another. Particularly for the retail investor, I think it is important to realize that in the investment world, they are often the very last to see and to participate in these collective iteratively formed “crowded trades” of the herd.

With a few minor caveats that I come back to in Chapter 8, “Social Mood and the Markets Today: So Where Are We?,” I agree that the broad market indices (the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average) are the best real-time social mood barometer out there. They rise as our mood improves and fall as our mood deteriorates. Markets are moved by changes in our mood. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=604))

- Most investors (and certainly the financial press) lump together everything from hurricanes and tornados to corporate earnings and actions by the Federal Reserve as reasons for market movements up and down. At the risk of splitting hairs too finely, I’d encourage you to consider man-made exogenous events distinct from acts of God. As I hope becomes clear from this book, the decision-making processes behind man-made “events” reflect the same mood as the market itself. Obviously, there is no human decision-making process behind a tornado, hurricane, ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=615))

- earthquake, or other act of God. But there is a decision-making process in our own reaction to natural disasters, and mood plays a huge role in that process. Looking at the stock market chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2005 that’s shown in Figure 1.5, it would be very hard to point to Hurricane Katrina. (It occurred in late August.) Then again, on a chart of Japan’s Nikkei index for 2011 (see Figure 1.6), it’s all but impossible to miss the tsunami that occurred in March.

- So why is that the case? In periods of rising mood, as was the case in the U.S. during 2005, our rising confidence enabled us to see past the disaster and see the economic opportunities still ahead. In periods of falling mood, as was the case in Japan during 2011, we saw only the adverse consequences and the uncertainty created by the disaster.

- As I noted earlier, markets react differently to near-identical news every day. One day markets rise on positive earnings reports and on another day they fall. The same is true with acts of God and other non-financial events. I have more examples later in the book, the market’s reaction to which I expect will surprise you. As you’ll see, what is logical to us is entirely situational—it depends precisely on the level and direction of our mood (rising or falling) at a given time.

- I would like to pause here to discuss how social mood and the media interact. From my perspective, media (online, print, television, radio, Facebook, Twitter, and so on) are all just more social interconnection points that serve as mirrors reflecting both the herd’s mood on you and your mood back on the herd. Too many investors read the papers or watch television just for the news, instead of for the real-time indicator of social mood that they are. Remember, headlines are meant to sell papers and to draw you into online articles, so they are specifically written to resonate with your mood as a reader. As a result, all headlines and news stories act as mirrors on how you really feel, often without you even realizing it.

- From my perspective, these headlines did a great job of capturing our mood at the time; however, I saw none of this yet captured in market prices. During the next week, however, stocks fell precipitously. Even more, I’d note that people rioted in London and set fire to cars in Germany and Ireland, and, not surprisingly, reported consumer confidence plummeted in August.

- When I saw the headlines, I felt like our mood had deteriorated significantly, but the market’s actions did not yet reflect that. Note that the reverse can also be true, however. Headlines and the media can often be late in capturing our mood. For example, I love all of those “market plummeting” news specials on CNBC and Bloomberg. They are great indicators of a pending change in market direction. Why? Because they pull together both emotion (with all the scary music that naturally accompanies those programs) and our collective sense of uncertainty. And if it is on national television, we must all be feeling it, too. The same is true for many magazine covers. They are often much better contrarian indicators than anything. For example, The Economist featured a particularly grim cover on its October 1, 2011 issue with the headline, “Until politicians actually do something about the world economy...BE AFRAID,” with “BE AFRAID” in big bold red lettering in the center no less. That cover coincided perfectly with a major market bottom, following which the S&P bounced more than 20% in less than a month! More often than not, investors fall victim to the mood and emotion reflected in the media and do precisely the wrong thing in response. Rather than readily accepting headlines and cover stories as fact, investors would be much wiser to ask themselves whether the “certainty” reflected on magazine covers and news stories all around them is already reflected in market prices. When it is, a significant market turn may be at hand. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=665))

- And I am sure, too, that there are more than a few economists who might be bothered by the notion that we and the markets are rarely, if ever, rational.

- Although I found the principles of socionomics and the causal relationship between mood and events of great interest, I struggled for a long time with specifically how and why mood could alter outcomes.

- To see how mood directly affects our decision-making processes, I am going to borrow from one of the best artificial mood creators I know of: the rollercoaster. Nothing does a better job of creating what I call self-assured uncertainty (where we are certain of being uncertain) in a hurry than the click, click, click of the coaster as it slowly begins its ascent skyward at the beginning of the ride. And I love how most coasters pause at the very, very top of the hill as if to put an exclamation point on the uncertain experience we are about to face, giving us a final second or two to think… ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=696))

- To return to the rollercoaster analogy I offered earlier, consider for a second what happens the moment after the ride ends. Suddenly we are eagerly talking to the person next to us and discussing what ride we might take next. “Me” is now “us”—we begin to herd. And “here” and “now” have expanded to incorporate somewhere across the amusement park and later in the day. To analogize, it is as if our minds have been fitted with variable lens goggles that automatically manage our peripheral vision in three dimensions: a physical horizon, a time horizon, and a relationship horizon, where our vision in all three dimensions is based on our level of confidence. I’ve come to think of this 3-D peripheral vision as our Horizon Preference. It is what we naturally, and often unknowingly, prefer based on our level of mood. Where we are and how we see and deal with the world around us is based on our mood along a continuum from “me, here, now” to “us, everywhere, forever.” I believe that in times of rising mood our Horizon Preference naturally expands without us even realizing it; conversely, when our mood falls, our… ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=726))

In one case we are making decisions during rising mood and in the other we are making decisions during declining mood.

Mood determines our Horizon Preference, which in turn—without us even realizing it—drives what we see as logical and the decisions we make. Put simply, our actions are ruled by our level of confidence, both individually and as a collective whole. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=748))

- In a moment, I talk specifically about the decision-making processes that accompany both rising and falling moods. Before doing that, though, I encourage you to consider the world today and the headlines and events that you see around you. Looking at the charts in Figures 2.2 and 2.3, does what you see around you in business, politics, and the economy suggest an upward-right or a lower-left migration in mood—“me, here, now” or “us, everywhere, forever”? If you think mood peaked and we are in a period of deteriorating mood, when do you think the peak was and why? On the other hand, if you see mood rising, what specific evidence of “us, everywhere, forever” would you expect to see at the very top? Think about the headlines I presented in Chapter 1, “Understanding Social Mood”; all of them suggested to me a significant “lower-left” move in late July 2011. Even billionaire George Soros—by closing his fund to all but his family (a less “us” and more “me” decision)—was moving toward the lower left (and probably not even realizing it)! But note that in late July the lower-left move in Horizon Preference reflected in the headlines had not yet been priced into stock market values.

- I hope the lists help you to appreciate what an enormous flywheel rising confidence is to an economy, as it drives decisions across the public and private sectors that are both uniformly positive and symbiotic. One of the ways that I believe that rising confidence most affects growth is in the way changes in time preference affect our economic decisions. In periods of weak social mood, most economic decisions are based strictly on current income levels. (And in periods of very severe downturns in mood, even current income is viewed as entirely temporary.) As mood improves, however, the uncertainties associated with current income are replaced by certainties that go along with more permanent wealth. Although economists refer to this as the wealth effect I think that it is more the rising mood effect; rising mood expands our ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=809))

- Banks and Declines in Social Mood From my perspective there are few industries more adversely affected by downturns in social mood than banking. For banks, declining confidence generates a toxic combination of asset value deflation and liability inflation at precisely the same time when, due to lower confidence levels, everyone from the markets to regulators to depositors wants these firms to hold more capital. Nowhere has this been clearer over the past three years than at a firm like Bank of America. On the asset side, declining confidence has resulted in lower credit demand and rising delinquencies coupled with more stringent credit standards and general risk aversion; meanwhile mark-to-market securities holdings (stocks and bonds that a firm ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=914))

- would typically buy because it anticipated a near-term rise in their value) have been written down and cross-selling has declined. Finally, both regulatory and public sentiment have constrained the bank’s ability to raise prices, with the Bank’s proposed $5.00-per-month debit card fee receiving particularly fierce condemnation from both consumers and public officials. On the liability side of the balance sheet, during the banking crisis, BofA’s borrowing costs increased as many depositors and most non-deposit creditors sought greater yields while ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=920))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the Bank concurrently tried to lengthen its debt maturities to reduce liquidity risk. Then, of course, there has been massive litigation, adding even more liabilities to the balance sheet. Finally, within capital, BofA has faced any number of challenges as the regulators and the markets have repeatedly sought both more and better quality equity, forcing the firm in response to sell off profitable businesses and other investments to close the gap. For investors, I think it is important to recognize that because of their financial leverage (10 to 12:1 debt-to-equity ratios even in good times) and their susceptibility to asset deflation and liability inflation, banks are incredibly vulnerable to declining social mood. As a result, they are always one of the first industries to reflect social mood drops. Even more, the magnitude of their challenges are a great early indicator of what is to come for the rest of the economy. (That said, I would also note that the reverse is true. When mood turns at the bottom, the intense valuation compression applied on the way down is often “released” with enormous ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=924))

- Finally, what about the “i” prefix for Apple’s most successful products? Although it was initially intended to capture the “i” in Internet, I can’t help but wonder whether today, in light of our declining mood, we’ve all come to better think of the “i” as capturing “I” as in my Mac, my phone, and my tablet/tv/movie screen. Better than any other company, I believe that Apple’s entire product line aligned with consumers’ natural desire for “me, here, now” technology solutions during a period of poor social mood.

- Although many may suggest that it is pure coincidence, the recurring alignment of financial, social, political, and even cultural decisions that reflect a consistent time, physical, and relationship horizon suggests to me that our underlying mood matters. History rhymes, and multi-dimensionally at that. Rising confidence broadens our Horizon Preference whereas falling confidence does the reverse. The good news for investors is that because the direction of our mood manifests itself in so many ways, there are abundant signs along the way to provide clues as to both where we are and where we are headed.

- to look for—and hopefully the lists offered earlier in the chapter will help you in the future—it is almost hard not to see examples every day. I find that by focusing on objective measures of social mood—and the specific behaviors that I see that reflect either rising or falling levels of confidence—I can stay clear of the emotions of the market. This begs the following question: If we move up and down along a continuum of rising and falling moods, how do we know when rising mood has peaked and falling mood has bottomed? How, using social mood, do we minimize our investment risks when we buy and sell? ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=960))

- So if we repeatedly exhibit the same decision-making behavior at the very top, why don’t we see it and stop ourselves from repeating the past? I think there are several reasons. First, underlying every bubble is what I call a Big Truth: a statement that is both compelling and at the same time, if false, would draw the entire investment premise into doubt. It’s something like “the Internet will change the world forever,” “China will dominate the global economy,” or “Western governments are the safest out there and they will never default on their sovereign debt.” ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1004))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The Big Truth is a very black-or-white statement. It either is or it isn’t. Even more so, you can (or think you can) begin it with the words “obviously” or “of course.” It is highly believable by people of all levels of sophistication. It is something everyone can easily understand. But appreciate, too, that by the very top there has been plenty of data and experience to support that not only is the Big Truth true, it has been all but proved certain. There is a track record of success, and in the context of business I think it is important to appreciate that this success has been shared by everyone in the food chain—employees, customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, government officials, regulators, and so on. Everybody is in—even the skeptics. At the very top it truly is “us”—all of us—and to me, one of the most important elements of a peak in mood is the saturation in our thinking that not only is the Big Truth certain, but what is great today will be only greater in the future (the “forever” quality). And there are often “everywhere” aspects, too. There is certainty that the opportunities are boundless, whether by geography, product line, or some other measure. So why do even the skeptics climb aboard? I believe this again goes back to our herding instinct and our internal coding for survival. It is very hard (and very lonely—believe me I know from personal experience) to be a skeptic in a world in which everyone else exhibits self-assured certainty about what is ahead, especially as you watch them make a lot of money at it—which they are all too happy to remind you of. It is for this reason that I believe one of the best indicators of a peak in mood—whether in an individual stock or commodity, or for the market as a whole—is its resemblance to middle school. Tops are awash in strident, hubris-filled, self-assured certainty, and doubters are not only outcasts; they are publicly vilified idiots. It’s the seventh grade over and over again—an unfiltered, very black or very white world in which people either are or want to be in the “in crowd.” At the peak, those suggesting that prices are going to go down are not just nonbelievers, they are social outcasts ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1009))

- A third consistent element of peaks is oversized organizational complexity.

- A fourth trait of peaks is novice entrants. As discussed earlier, peak moods are filled with hubris that sucks everyone in at the very top. Peaks are a social vortex. But what I think few truly appreciate is that those who join last are most often the most naïve. They join not because they understand the underlying risks of the business (which at the top would be perceived by others to be nonexistent anyway) but because they see nothing but opportunity and because everyone else joined. They trust too much in both the Big Truth and the wisdom of the crowd. Rather than looking out the windshield, they use their rearview mirror to see what they think is ahead. They buy based on a “proven” track record and the confidence exhibited by others around them. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1061))

The hostility that he received in readers’ comments was nothing like I had seen before. The reaction wasn’t just middle school; it was middle school on a rampage!

- Now, whether or not August 2011 was the top or just a very significant top I’ll admit I don’t know (from its peak in August to its December 2011 low, gold fell by more than 20%), but to me all of the indicators were present: a saturating belief in a Big Truth, hubris-filled self-assured certainty, naïve novice entrants, and credit extension that assumed higher and higher prices. To top it all off—and to my point about fear and greed being indistinguishable—timed to near-perfection at the August peak, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he wanted all of that country’s gold that had been held… ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1131))

- As I hope you can appreciate, the confluence of factors that define a peak naturally also set up a painful aftermath for investors. Big Truths become false. The abdications of risk management become obvious. Complexity becomes unmanageable. The naïve and novice feel betrayed. And overborrowing becomes evident. The illusion embodied in self-assured certainty is broken; and depending on the magnitude of the peak, it is as if we’ve all learned that there is no Santa Claus. Try as hard as we can, after we don’t believe, we simply can’t find a way to believe again—at least not without a long passage of time. Lower prices don’t help. But appreciate, too, that following the “all of us, everywhere, forever” attitude that accompanies peak mood, there is a natural migration toward “me, here, now.” With it comes increased scrutiny, a further reduction in trust, and so on.

- First, the Big Truth, which had morphed from “homes as shelters” in the Great Depression to “homes as the embodiment of the American Dream” during the 1950s and 1960s, became unequivocally, “homes are a risk-free investment.” TV shows like Flip That House made that clear to us every night. I think it is important to appreciate, though, that the Big Truth of “homes as a risk-free investment” came not at the beginning of the bull market in housing that began in the Great Depression, but at the very tail end of it. We saw homes as a risk-free investment because we had the necessary history to support it. Because it had been true, we believed it to be true and we saw it as being true well into the future. Once again, we used the rearview mirror, not the windshield, to see what was ahead. Please appreciate, too, that with the migration of the Big Truth to “homes as a risk-free investment” also came the “utility” to “investment” shift in supply and demand mechanics. The higher the price of homes went, the more people bought them. American homeownership peaked in 2005. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1249))

- Abdication of Risk Management Not surprisingly, the Big Truth of “homes as a risk-free investment” also had a dramatic effect on the second element of peak mood—the abdication of risk management. From loan underwriting standards to the proliferation of second mortgages and home equity lines to investors’ blind reliance on the rating agencies, every step along the mortgage origination conveyor belt reflected an unprecedented confidence that home values could not and would not decline. Just consider the chart in Figure 4.3 of revolving home equity loan balances and what these loans said about the level of certainty both lenders and borrowers had in future home values. From 2000 to 2006 balances rose more than four-fold! ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1258))

- Note how at the very peak of the housing bubble (2005/2006), mortgage-backed securities investors no longer needed guarantees from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at all to get comfortable with the underlying credit risk. And even more, within the private-label (non-agency-guaranteed) category itself while “prime” mortgage demand rose, at the top of the market, there was an explosion in lower credit quality Alt-A and lowest quality subprime mortgages.

At the risk of suggesting that a picture is worth a thousand words, I think the chart by Daniel Edstrom of DTC Systems (Figure 4.5), of his family’s own mortgage—from application through to funding and then the loan’s sale and securitization—offers a far better view of how complicated the mortgage market was at the very top than anything I could possibly write.

- Excessive Credit and Architecture Needless to say, the final two peak mood elements of excessive credit and opulent, self-aggrandizing architecture are today all too obvious. The term McMansion has even entered our vernacular. Once again self-assured certainty led to the overreaching that Jim Collins warned about, and in the case of housing it was a self-assured certainty that saturated all participants across the private and public sectors. Hopefully, though, when looked at in the context of a time frame of more than 70 years it is easier to see how light goes to dark, not overnight, but through the thousands of shades of darker and darker gray that naturally accompany greater and greater confidence. Still, when held up to the objective criteria that accompany peak mood, it is difficult for me to see how both the private and public sectors missed the peaking of the housing bubble, particularly as we were literally building it in our own backyards. That is the nature of peaks in mood. By the time the peak hits, Big Truths are… ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1296))

- The problem comes, though, when social mood deteriorates. At that point, time horizons shrink and rather than focusing on college as an investment to be recouped over, say, 10, 20, or even 40 years, students instead are likely to look to see whether they will be able to get a job upon graduation—a dramatic shrinking of the time horizon! Even worse, the reality of having paid top dollar (and borrowing to do so) imposes not only an enormous financial burden, but also a psychological one as well. As a result, current graduates are likely to feel the same kind of betrayal that many homeowners now do. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1351))

- Although this chapter focuses specifically on higher education, I think it is important for individuals and organizations involved directly with philanthropy and charitable giving to appreciate the tight correlation of generosity with social mood and the markets. Put simply, a donor’s willingness to give is tied far more to his or her own level of confidence than it is to the severity of the need of the recipient. From my perspective most not-for-profit organizations, particularly those involved with social needs, woefully underestimate how leveraged they truly are to the market/social mood. In good times not only do rising markets boost these groups’ endowments and lift donor giving, it often lessens the social need itself. (For example, rising employment levels lead to a declining need for food banks and other social services.) On the other hand, the decline in market prices that accompanies falling mood depletes endowments at a time when donor contributions are likely to be falling and the mission-related needs of the organization are rising. Some organizations have tried to mitigate this risk by relying on portfolio diversification in their endowments and calculating their annual endowment draws using a three-, five- or even ten-year rolling average. To me, most organizations would be far better off considering an enterprise-wide assessment of their social mood-related risks and to use their endowments’ asset allocation to help manage and, in most cases, mitigate that risk. Rather than the 60/40 equity to fixed income mix that many endowments deploy, I suspect that most would be much better served by an allocation that is at a minimum the reverse. That said, I’d also throw out the thought that by the time most organizations finally come to this conclusion, their own risk-averse behavior (and their willingness—if not outright eagerness—to sacrifice more potential market appreciation in exchange for greater loss protection) is likely to accompany a major bottoming of the markets.

- With few exceptions, the major buildings/facilities on campus all tie to major market peaks—the late 1920s, the late 1960s/early 1970s and 2000 and 2007. But I would note that there is a significant distinction between the most recent building boom and the other two major construction periods from the past century. In the earlier building “booms” there were major academic buildings constructed that were followed near the very top of the market with more “student-centered” buildings, such as more spacious dormitories, improved athletic facilities, and so on. In fact William and Mary opened its “Sorority Court” in September 1929. What is significant to me is the large number of facilities built over the past 20 years on William and Mary’s campus—and judging by my own visits, on other college campuses as well—that go well beyond supporting the core undergraduate academic program. Most building activity was to support expanding graduate programs, student activities, athletics, and the arts—what we saw at the very top of prior confidence cycles. I would feel much more optimistic about the prospects for the higher education industry if what was constructed on campus was more “mission critical.” My concern is that what we have witnessed is the McMansion’ing of college campuses—just as we saw at the peak of the housing market in suburbia—with colleges adding high-cost, nice-to-have facilities based on an extreme level of self-assured certainty.

- Extreme “Me, Here, Now” Behaviors As I noted at the beginning of the book, bottoms in confidence reflect not only uncertainty, but self-assured uncertainty. To borrow Dave’s line from this chapter’s introduction, at the bottom despair reigns and there is an omnipresent sense that we don’t know what, if any, good the future will bring. It is a state of fear-filled delusion that we see as a long-lasting, if not permanent, condition. The net result, though, is that our decisions and actions reflect extreme “me, here, now” choices. At the bottom generosity is replaced with selfishness and self-interested behavior as it is my, not our, survival that matters most to me. In addition, what was once viewed as offering permanent certainty—such as wealth and income—is now not only temporary, but even the time span of temporary is uncertain. It could be a day, a week, or a month. Who knows? At the bottom, I not only believe that the rug may be pulled out from under me, but I have come to expect it.

- Having reflected on self-assured uncertainty for some time, I believe that better than any of the “opposite” elements I listed, perhaps the best characteristics of a trough in confidence can be captured in the words “hoarding” and “sacrifice.” Before discussing both of these traits, let me reinforce that like the saturated sensation of self-assured certainty that we feel at the top, at the very bottom there is an equivalent sensation of saturating self-assured uncertainty.

- Hoarding Behaviors With that sense of uncertainty in mind, let me turn to hoarding. I suspect that when some of you read the word hoarding your minds immediately turned to the runs on the banks experienced in the U.S. during the Great Depression. (And, yes, those runs really did correspond to the extraordinary sense of uncertainty that accompanied the market/social mood bottom.) But I encourage you to think of hoarding much more broadly than just the natural urge to hold physical cash as mood deteriorates and to consider the word in the context of generosity. As mood deteriorates toward the bottom, all aspects of our generosity (financial, social, emotional, political, and so on) toward others drops dramatically. In some extreme cases it even ceases to exist. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1498))

- If bear markets end in despair, then at the bottom we act desperately. But what is particularly interesting to me about moments of peak self-assured uncertainty is how our desperate actions are all specifically focused on doing something to end our state of hopelessness. To me this is why investors naturally sell losing stocks at the bottom. With intense hopelessness, there is an acute need to do something—in some cases literally anything—to create a renewed level of certainty. I contrast this to market tops where we want things to go on forever (and certainly want to believe that they will). With bottoms, there is much more of a saturating “Make it stop right now!” quality. At the very bottom, we want it to be over immediately.

- Commodity Peaks I realize this may seem like an odd location to discuss peaks in commodities, but I would encourage you to think about these moments as having behavioral attributes much more consistent with market bottoms than market tops. As a rule, commodity peaks accompany a saturating self-assured sense of scarcity—that there is and will continue to be a significant shortage in the specific product. That permanent sense of scarcity (and the resulting hoarding) reflects an extreme “me, here, now” mood. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1520))

- The consequence is that commodity peaks are typically much more event-like in their formation. Rather than the rounded tops experienced in other markets, commodity peaks are often very sharp-tipped—rapid melt-ups followed by sudden melt-downs. The oil market exhibited this behavior in 2008, and gold followed a similar pattern in 2011. I am sure for some readers my reference earlier to Venezuelan president Chavez’s demand that all of the country’s gold holdings be repatriated in mid-August 2011 may have been confusing. Hopefully, now it makes more sense. President Chavez was displaying classic “me, here, now” hoarding behavior. In commodities, that happens at tops, not bottoms. But I would also offer that the alignment of the early 1970s gas crisis and the 2008 peak in oil to periods of… ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1525))

- overreach.) For these reasons, I think sacrifice is an important characteristic in the behaviors exhibited at market bottoms. As noted earlier, sometimes that sacrifice is a leader or leadership team of a company whereas at other times it could be a division or a product or product line. In bankruptcy it is obviously creditors’ and shareholders’ financial interests that are sacrificed. But, again, at the bottom a very deliberate action is being taken to end uncertainty. There is another important aspect to this as well. To me, hoarding is all about ending the current uncertainty by trying to hold onto and hopefully return to a past that you believe to be more certain than the present. Sacrifice, on the other hand, is all about changing the current uncertain present into a more certain future. When we sacrifice we acknowledge that we can’t go back. We burn the ships; and in doing so we perceive that there will be a better future as a result of our action. Implicit in sacrifice is a rising level of confidence (otherwise the sacrificial action would not yet have been taken). I realize that this might seem like angels dancing on the head of a pin, but implicit in sacrifice is a critical mind shift from both the past (the more certain past that we believe that through hoarding we can somehow return to) and the present (our current uncertainty) to sometime in the future. That is to say that rather than our Horizon Preference continuing to move to the lower… ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1539))

- Now, some of you might be thinking that sacrifice and hoarding are at opposite ends of the spectrum of behavior, but in the context of eliminating uncertainty I don’t think that is at all the case. Both actions reflect an expressed decision to end mounting self-assured uncertainty. As I said earlier, people who hoard are trying to hold on to the past, whereas people who sacrifice are trying to change the future.

- Until I saw this chart, I had thought of 9/11 as an event that caused our stock market to fall. Today, I see the horrific event as the result of the kind of action some people are unfortunately willing to make at the bottom of severe declines in social mood and the markets. (And so that you may appreciate the opposite end of the confidence spectrum as well, I would note that the U.S. military operation in Pakistan that resulted in the killing of Osama Bin Laden occurred on May 2, 2011, the same day that U.S. stock market peaked after rising for 26 months and more than 80% from its March 2009 low.)

- Event Versus Cycle Lows Having discussed the sensation of saturating self-assured uncertainty and the hoarding and sacrifice aspects that go along with it in concept, I want to look at a few real market/mood bottoms. Before I do that, though, I want to distinguish between what many think of as “event”-driven market bottoms and cyclical lows. Today, when many investors think of major market bottoms, they associate them with significant events like September 11, 2001, the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008, or even the 1929 crash—dates of violent market declines. Although all of these events, like the 2011 tsunami in Japan, represented trading lows—with significant bounces thereafter—in all cases the markets subsequently moved to lower lows before bottoming. What is remarkable, though, about the ultimate lows in the market for each of these “events”—in October 2002, March 2009, and even July 1932—is that there is nothing “individually” specific or remarkable about them. There is no single event that puts an exclamation point on why the market bottomed on the specific day that it did. To me, this speaks to the saturation aspect of market bottoms (and tops, for that matter) in which the ultimate turning… ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1580))

- During September 2002, as the major indices bottomed, President Bush pressured both Congress and the UN Security Council to draft resolutions to allow for military intervention in Iraq. At the same time there were anti-war protests in major U.S. cities and in London. Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey withdrew from his reelection campaign due to ethics issues, and New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed civil fraud lawsuits against current and former executives of WorldCom, Qwest, Metro Fiber Networks, and McLeod USA. In early October, Washington, DC’s “Beltway Sniper” struck for the first time.

- Wars and Market Bottoms Many economists and historians like to suggest that World War II lifted us out of the Great Depression. Note, though, that nobody even suggests today that the Iraq War lifted us out of the market bottom in 2002. I highlight this distinction because in both cases, war reflected the kind of “sacrifice” brought on by the self-assured uncertainty that naturally accompanies market bottoms. Countries don’t enter war because they want to. They go to war because they believe they need to change the future into something more certain.

- The Market Low of March 2009 During the weeks leading up to the March 2009 low, Swiss banking giant UBS announced that it had settled tax evasion charges with U.S. prosecutors and replaced its CEO. Other major global banks reported staggering fourth quarter 2008 losses and the U.S. government increased its stake in Citigroup to 36%, and the U.K. government raised its stake in Lloyds to more than 60%. New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo subpoenaed Bank of America’s Chairman and CEO Ken Lewis for misleading investors during the late 2008 purchase of Merrill Lynch. President Obama announced that most U.S. troops would leave Iraq by August 2010 and the American Reconstruction and Reinvestment Act passed Congress. Finally, following CNBC contributor Rick Santelli’s on-air rant, the first Tea Party demonstration was held in Chicago, and more than 100,000 people gathered in Dublin to protest Ireland’s handling of the financial crisis.

- Note that in March 2009, at the very market bottom, President Obama announced that the U.S. would leave Iraq, the direct opposite presidential decision from October 2002, another major market bottom. As contradictory as that may seem, I believe that the two reflect the same mood-based decision making. The deep deterioration in social mood, in the aftermath of 9/11, led to the Iraq War because political leaders believed that something needed to be done to end the uncertainty (both economic and related to the threat of terrorism). By going to war, there was a belief that the future would be more certain—and here I would again emphasize that desperate need to do something as mood is bottoming. Just sitting is emotionally paralyzing. Not seven years after entering Iraq, though, public sentiment had shifted 180 degrees. By the spring of 2009, the Iraq War in the minds of many, particularly political leaders in Washington, equaled uncertainty. By calling for the return of U.S. troops, President Obama believed he was creating a more certain future for the United States. I can imagine some readers at this point might be reaching for their old stock charts and then noting that President Nixon announced the end of the Vietnam War on January 23, 1973, just as the markets were peaking ahead of a very precipitous decline. Wouldn’t that directly contradict what happened in Iraq? Not at all. President Nixon announced the initial troop withdrawals and “Vietnamization” during the bear market of 1969. The January 1973 announcement, on the other hand, was for a culminating peace treaty that followed severe U.S. bombing of Hanoi in… ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1616))

- The Market Bottom of 1932 In looking through newspapers and magazine stories from 1932, what comes across so clearly is the extraordinary self-assuredness of the uncertainty experienced at the bottom of the Great Depression. People were not just uncertain, they were truly certain of being uncertain. Not surprisingly then, their actions during the spring and summer of 1932 reflected the collective culminating desperation of the period: the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act (splitting banks from brokerages, the supposed “culprits” of the 1929 Crash); the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby; the suicide of the Swedish financier “Match King”; World War I veteran protests in Washington; demands by the Daughters of the American Revolution for the deportation of jobless aliens; President Hoover’s admission that Prohibition was a failure. The feeling of hopelessness was saturating—so much so that in August 1932, the month after the… ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1634))

- Seeing Major Market Bottoms in Real Time Admittedly, the market/mood bottoms that I have just discussed represent the end of three of the most severe declines in social mood/market corrections over the past 80 years, and I have the clear benefit of hindsight in evaluating them. But less severe market troughs offer similar characteristics, just to a lesser degree. As noted in Chapter 2, “Horizon Preference: How Mood Affects Our Decision Making,” the August 2011 market low for the FTSE 100 coincided with the “desperation” of the London riots. During the week of the October 2011 low in the S&P, I shared this thought in real time with my clients under the title “It’s Around Here Somewhere”: I’m going to go out on a limb to suggest that there is a bottom nearby. Whether that bottom happened near 1070 on the S&P on Tuesday or will happen shortly at a level below—or even well below—that level, we’ll see; but to these eyes there are reflections of self-assured uncertainty everywhere I look. This past week Forbes ran a column by British historian Paul Johnson entitled “Who Can Lead Us To Safety;” while… ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1644))

- Then there were these comments from Moody’s on Wednesday: ‘There has been a profound loss of confidence in certain European sovereign debt markets, and Moody’s considers that this extremely weak market sentiment will likely persist...It is no longer a temporary problem that might be addressed through liquidity support, and several euro-area governments are increasingly affected by the loss of confidence.’ Put simply, certainty has been lost and is not coming back any time soon; and we see no one who can rescue us from the deep end of the pool. Be afraid. Or at least that is what we now think. The problem I have with all of this is that both tops and bottoms are defined by… ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1658))

- Hopefully these examples have provided you with a sense of not only the financial decisions made at the bottom of a market, but also the political and social actions as well. In my own note to my clients, though, you saw that I was not at all specific as to the price at which I thought the market bottomed. From my perspective there is a world of difference between sensing that from a social mood standpoint a bottom is near and proclaiming the price at which the bottom will occur. For what it’s worth, the same can be said about market peaks as well. I raise this point because many investors try to time bottoms and tops only to find that they have acted too soon, selling before a peak, for example, or purchasing before a bottom. Given that specific stocks, and markets in general, are subject to both “melt-ups” of self-assured certainty in which prices might rise dramatically at the very end of cycle and “melt-downs” of self-assured uncertainty in which prices do the reverse, to me the real value in understanding the social mood elements of tops and bottoms is that it enables you to prepare. To be able to say to yourself, “It’s around here somewhere.” Most investors forget that there are 100 yards between the end zones of a significant trough and a… ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1667))

- One of the Recession 101 signs I saw offered this thought: “Bill Gates started Microsoft in a recession.” I highlight this line because another way to think of sacrifice is invention, or, more likely in Mr. Gates’s case, personal re-invention. Although I will leave the coincidence of Microsoft’s founding and an economic recession to others, I suspect that Mr. Gates (and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen) were both operating with a very “me, here, now” mindset. We don’t say “Necessity is the mother of invention” for nothing. But consider how the entire business cycle fits with the Horizon Preference framework and how rising confidence naturally moves an organization from the “me, here, now” beginning phase of invention through innovation and expansion and all the way to the “us, everywhere, forever” point of saturation and overreaching (see Figure 6.3).

- For most investors, quarterly earnings are like a dinner at a restaurant. They either like the food or they don’t. Even more importantly, although they may want to meet the chef, few diners ever really want to go into the kitchen to see how the food was prepared, and almost none want to be dragged through the recipe step by step, let alone taken to the slaughterhouse to see how farm-to-table dining really works. The earnings rule is simple: Just put it on the plate. Don’t make me understand how it got there. ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1745))

- I would note, however, that investors’ willingness to overlook “burnt” earnings is directly tied to mood. During a bull market for a stock, investors ignore bad news believing it to be an anomaly—the chef is having a bad day. Conversely, during periods of falling mood, we extrapolate burnt earnings into the future, and as investors we look for a different place to eat. In bear markets, bad earnings news is financial food poisoning. ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008J8RCTW&location=1756))

- The result is that we deregulate accounting all the way up a bull market and we re-regulate all the way down. The consequence is that it is much easier for a corporation to generate $1.00 of earnings at the top of the market than it is at the bottom of the market.
