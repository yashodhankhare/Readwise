- That earliest, most primal boundary, between each of us and the world—called ectoderm, a lonely fragile layer thin as a single cell—gives rise to skin as well as brain, and so it is with this same ancient borderline that contact between human beings is felt in all its forms, physical or psychological—across the spectrum, from healthy to disordered social states. The stories move among the universal feelings of loss and grief in human relationships, to deep fractures in the basic experience of external reality that come with mania and psychosis, and finally to disruptions encroaching even on the inner self: the lost ability to feel pleasure in our lives as can happen in depression, the lost ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=97))

- motivation to nourish ourselves as in disorders of eating, and even the loss of the self itself—with dementia at life’s end. Along this second dimension, the emotions of the subjective inner world, we begin and end with imagination—whether in stories of prehistory (feelings leave no fossils; we cannot know what was felt in the past, and so we do not attempt to be evolutionary psychologists) or of the present (since even today we cannot directly observe another human being’s inner experience).

- Crucially for what came later, at around the same time I was exposed to neural networks, a rapidly growing branch of computer science in which actual memory storage needing no guidance or supervision is achieved by simple collections of units, each cell-like and elemental—things existing in code, with only simple abstract properties—but connected to one another virtually, by operation of the program. Neural networks, as the name suggests, were inspired by neurobiology, but these ideas were so powerful that this computational field would later spawn a revolution in machine intelligence called deep learning, which today uses large collections of ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=144))

- cell-like elements to reshape virtually every area of human inquiry and information—including, returning the original favor, neurobiology. Large groups of connected small things, it seems, can achieve almost anything—if connected in the right way. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=149))

- Large groups of connected small things, it seems, can achieve almost anything—if connected in the right way. I began to consider the possibility of understanding something as mysterious as emotion, at the level of cells. What causes powerful feelings in the well or ill person, feelings adaptive or maladaptive? Or more directly, what in fact are those feelings, in a physical sense, down to the level of cells and their connections? This struck me as perhaps the most profound mystery in the universe—rivaled only by the question of the universe’s origin, its reason for being. Clearly, the human brain would be important in approaching this challenge, because only human beings can adequately describe their emotions. Neurosurgeons (I thought) had the most physical and privileged access to the human brain; therefore, the logical path for me, the one that provided the most direct approach to helping, healing, and studying the human brain, seemed to be neurosurgery. So throughout graduate school and into my medical training, I steered myself in this direction. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=150))

- However, toward the final year of medical school, like all medical students, I was required to complete a brief rotation in psychiatry, without which I could not graduate. Until that point, I had never felt any particular affinity for psychiatry; in fact I had experienced the field as unsettling. Perhaps it was the seeming subjectivity of the diagnostic tools available, or perhaps there was within me some unknown, even deeper issue I had not addressed. Whatever the reason, psychiatry was the last specialty I would have selected. On the other hand, my early experiences with neurosurgery had been invigorating: I loved the operating room, the life-or-death drama juxtaposed with meticulous precision and attention to detail, the focus and intensity and rhythm of suturing set against the high charge of arousal. And so it was stunning to my friends and family, and to myself, when I chose psychiatry instead. I had been trained to see brains as biological objects—as they indeed are—organs built from cells and fed by blood. But in psychiatric illness, the organ itself is not damaged in a way we can see, as we can visualize a fractured leg or a weakly pumping heart. It is not the brain’s blood supply but rather its hidden communication process, its internal voice, that struggles. There is nothing we can measure, except with words—the patient’s communications, and our own. Psychiatry was organized around the deepest mystery in biology, perhaps in the universe, and I could only use ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=158))

- words, my first and greatest passion, to crack open a gate leading to the mystery. This conjunction, once realized, reset my path entirely. And it all began, as life-changing disruptions so often do, with a singular experience. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=169))

- As complicated as the human brain seems to be, it is only a clump of cells like every other part of the human body. These are beautiful cells, to be sure, including more than eighty billion neurons specialized for conducting electricity, each shaped like a richly branched bare tree in winter—and each forming tens of thousands of chemical connections called synapses with other cells. Tiny blips of electrical activity continually course through these cells, pulsing along fat-insulated electrical-conduction fibers called axons that together form the white matter of the brain, each pulse lasting only a millisecond and measurable in picoamps of current. This intersection of electricity and chemistry somehow gives rise to everything that the human mind can do, remember, think, and feel—and it is all done with cells, which can be studied and understood and changed.

- By taking this approach—and integrating technological advances from other laboratories as well, in microscopy, genetics, and protein engineering—the scientific community has now obtained many thousands of insights into how cells give rise to brain function and behavior. For example, researchers identified specific axonal connections projecting across the brain (like warp threads embedded in a tapestry, entwined with countless other crossing fibers) through which cells in the frontal parts of the brain reach deep into regions that govern powerful emotions like fear and reward seeking, and help restrain behaviors that would otherwise turn these emotions and drives into impulsive action. These findings were made possible because specific connections defined by their origin and trajectory through the brain could now be precisely controlled—in real time, at the speed of thought and feeling, during the complex behaviors of animal life. These deeply embedded axons help define brain states and guide expression of emotions. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=243))

- By grounding our understanding of inner states at the level of precisely defined physical structures in this way, we also obtain a concrete perspective on the past, on our evolution. This insight emerges since these physical structures were formed during our early development and infancy by the operation of our genes, and genes are what evolution has worked with in shaping human brains over the millennia. So our inner threads, in some sense, project across the time we have inhabited as well as across the space within us—a legacy anchored in humanity’s prehistory, needed by our forebears to survive. This connection to the past is not magical—this is nothing like “collective unconscious” communication, in the way that Carl Jung invoked mystical connections with distant ancestors across time—but arises from brain-cell structure, a physical heritage from our predecessors. Beings that by chance created the first early forms of these connections we possess (and study) today—with some variation from individual to individual—were likely to have survived and reproduced more effectively, and as a result, they passed the genes governing that brain-structure ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=251))

- predisposition down to us, and to other mammals in the modern world. So we do feel what our ancestors likely also felt—not just incidentally, but at times and in ways that mattered greatly to them. These inner states were bequeathed to us through the relentless will (and sometimes good fortune) of their survival—giving rise to humanity, with our feelings and our failings.

- There is no formal protocol in medical training to protect a doctor’s exposed heart in these particularly devastating moments. Physicians and nurses, warfighters, crisis workers—they all come to learn defenses on their own, in order to live among the extremes of human suffering. It is not just the magnitude of the pain but also its incessance—the unrelenting descent into the abyss, day after day, year after year—that without some safeguard would be unsustainable.

- I should have been better prepared, but there had been no warning that the keep was vulnerable. Until meeting Mateo (in my role as the on-call senior psychiatry resident who was summoned to the emergency room to evaluate him), I had not been hurt badly by my own empathy for years, not since I had been a raw and young medical student. But all had been different back then—my feelings were mostly only feelings in medical school, not feelings about feelings, a safer form they achieved later. And as a medical student I had been more vulnerable: coming of age in the halls of medicine, not yet able to give orders nor to prescribe, and still learning the language of the field though raising a child of my own as a single father in the world beyond. On that night that hurt me first and deepest, years before meeting Mateo, I was the medical student on pediatrics at our children’s hospital, on a call night that had not been too busy. My first task for the evening—a brief prelude for what was to come later that night—had been admitting and taking the history from a cystic fibrosis family. The patients were three-year-old twins brought in together for respiratory distress. It was hard for the children to breathe. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=328))

- The family was well known to the service, as we say. There had been many past admissions to the hospital, and the parents were pros at the process—so much so that they answered my questions as soon as I began to ask them, so much so that they were in the process of divorce. They had found, with the birth of the twins, what seemed to be a hidden flaw in their union. In most cystic fibrosis families, parents have no symptoms themselves, but each carries one copy of a mutant gene. Mammals have two copies of almost every gene, so often if a single gene is damaged, no ill effects are seen; the other copy can allow a healthy life. Mother and father are healthy carriers in cystic fibrosis, with the load carried not usually known until their child is born with a far heavier burden—both damaged copies of the gene. The math is simple, and I learned that night that the parents, in their own relative youth, had arrived together at a seemingly simple and practical decision to split and remarry, each to seek a noncarrier and the promise of greater health in the family. But in the meantime, before this defiance of the blind forces of population genetics could play out, I had to work through the mucousy tumult of the sick and screaming twins, patiently building my inventory of facts, collecting their medical history above the din, and completing the admission. By midnight, quiet had finally been restored when we got wind of a late emergency transfer arriving from an outside ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=337))

- border. The migration is risky for both, but when the larger organism learns from the smaller, retaining rather than destroying, then the perilous border crossing can instead give rise to a new kind of being. In the case of our lineage, we were brought the breath of life itself. Suddenly living together, the two kinds of life had to coevolve if they could, mutually accommodating each other’s limitations and oddities. There was time enough to sort it out, hundreds of millions of years—as long as the union was not immediately catastrophic—time for the new joint being to evolve, following the same Darwinian selection rules that gave rise to life itself, and that had allowed each part, each partner, to arise alone at first. Subcultures can be preserved in union. The small oxygen burners became our mitochondria, the energy factories for each cell. So ancient in origin that they use a different dialect of life’s DNA code, they have kept their mother tongue for private use over billions of years of living together with us. At the same time the microbes adapted themselves to our culture in countless other ways for the shared goal of survival. And we adapted as well, coming to need the burners as absolutely as they need us—they have become part of us now, and we will never be apart again.

- Today, seeking to control brain cells with great precision—in order to discover how the brain’s wonderful workings arise from pulses of electrical activity in cells—we supplant the random hand of evolution. Not wanting to wait a billion years, we put certain genes from another ancient DNA data stream—still persisting in microbes of the natural world—directly into mammalian neurons. We do this to take advantage of a distinct alchemy that this different class of microbes developed—turning not oxygen, but rather light, into energy and information—via specialized genes (called microbial opsins) that allow conversion of light into ionic current flowing through the surface membrane of a cell. And ion flow, the movement of charged particles, happens to be the natural signal for activation and inactivation of neurons.

- Anxiety is a complex state, with features we know from introspection: changes in bodily function (heart rate driven high, breaths coming fast and short), changes in behavior (apprehension and skittishness—avoidance of risky situations even if there is no immediate threat), and finally, subjectively, a negative or aversive internal state (feeling bad, one could say). Such utterly distinct features would, perhaps, have to be generated by correspondingly diverse cells in the brain. Optogenetics (along with other methods) illuminated how this complex state—so familiar to most of us—could be assembled and disassembled by different cells and their connections across the brain. For each of these components of anxiety (breathing rate, risk avoidance, and that unpleasant internal feeling), different axonal threads that could be responsible were discovered, and accessed, and controlled independently with optogenetics. Here is how it was done. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=529))

- Feeling bad seems gratuitous—and more than that, a vast and unnecessary source of suffering. Much of the clinical disability in psychiatry, after all, arises from the subjective negativity of states like anxiety and depression. One reason may be that life requires making choices between utterly distinct categories that cannot be compared directly. Subjectivity—feeling good or bad, for example—may be a sort of universal monetary instrument for the inner economy of the brain, allowing positivity or negativity from diverse pursuits, from food to sleep to sex to life itself, to be converted into a single common currency.

- In the case of crying, a biologist should presume that if fluid is ejected from a duct like those connected to our tear glands—with precise timing, and in consistent contexts, for individuals of the species—there is likely an evolutionary reason, and the matter is suitably objective for science. If changes in duct performance come along with a strong feeling, a subjective internal state, then the combination of subjective and objective should intrigue a scientist, a psychiatrist, or any student of the human mind and body. Crying is significant in psychiatry. Our patients are experiencing extreme emotions, and we work with these emotions—with their articulation, recognition, and expression. We are experienced in seeing the less genuine tears as well, across a spectrum of deception from the mildly suffering and modestly manufactured, to fully professional manipulative tears. Yet little is known in the science of emotional tears, such as it is. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=637))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Emotional crying cannot be studied well in animals. Pure emotional tears, as we experience the phenomenon, are not clearly present elsewhere even among our close relatives in the great ape family; the reason, if any, is a mystery. Tears are powerful for driving emotional connection; it is known that digitally altering tears in human face images will cause significant changes in the sympathy, and the impulse to help, elicited in viewers (much more than for altering other facial features). But we are no more social than our cousins—the chimpanzees, the bonobos—and still, using the mystery of tears, we alone cry, and cry alone. We display our inner state with this odd external signal, with or without audience, not requiring volition or intent, just broadcasting feeling to all observers and ourselves. But it is not only our great ape kin who seem excluded—even many of our own Homo sapiens do not shed tears emotionally, and so dwell just a bit apart. This separation may be one-way—those whose bodies do not generate the language still can understand and respond to emotional tears in others—but missing even this one part of the conversation may come at a cost; non-crying people have been found to show reduced personal attachment patterns, though it’s not known if this association is more due to life experience or innate predilection.

- If there is evolutionary significance of crying at all, then the times when emotional crying occurs may provide clues. Largely not voluntary in humans—this is a signal far less under our conscious control than, for example, smiling or grimacing—crying is a mostly honest journalist, reporting for some reason on a kind of feeling. Scholars have focused on its value for social communication, but emotional crying also happens, and feels important—even productive, addressing some need—when we are alone. Given all the risks of revealing true feelings (and all the individual benefits of successfully conveying false feelings, for beings in complex social environments), the poor controllability of this emotional readout seems at first a handicap rather than an advantage—something to be selected against, rather than selected for, at the level of the individual. Signaling to self, or to others—either way, it is interesting that this signal has remained mostly involuntary, and thus mostly true.

- Mateo was not suicidal, but could be diagnosed with major depression. I attached the label to him that night. Though it seemed an oversimplification, among other defining symptoms of depression he had a prominent hopelessness, expressed as an inability to look forward in time. Without hope for the future, Mateo could only look back. He never did cry for his family that night—not that I saw, nor that he could ever tell me. In considering this, and the reasons we have for crying, it seemed to me that an odd unity links tears of sadness, when they happen, and the more mysterious tears of joy. Tears come when we feel hope and frailty together, as one. I managed to keep myself from writing this in the chart—or writing that Mateo had no hope left to cry for. Mild improvements in material outcome that do not require a new model of self and circumstance—as with just making a bit more money in accord with known probabilities of the world—will not cause most people to cry. But when we do cry for joy—as when we feel the sudden warmth and hope of human connection at a wedding, or when we see an unexpected depth of empathy in a young child—there may be a flicker of hope for the future of the community, for humanity, against the cold. We can cry at a wedding or a birth, seeing heartfelt aspiration but knowing deeply the fragility of life and love: I hope that the joy ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=711))

- I see here will never die, I hope that the world will be kind enough to let this last forever, I hope that these feelings will survive—but I know very well they may not. This seems to be a kind of anxiety, even for what we think of as tears of joy, since a threat—though not immediately present—is known, and felt. At the other, truly negative, pole of value, tears of sadness in adult human beings similarly come not with mild losses from known risks but with sudden adverse personal realizations that must be addressed—like a shock of betrayal when the hope we had for the future is shaken and our model of the world, our map of possible paths in life (a map is hope), must be redrawn. When we cry, even when the feeling is negative, hope may be present—with new conditions, but it is hope nonetheless. Then we truthfully, involuntarily, signal this fragility of our future, and the fact that our model is changing, at the moment of realization—we signal this to our species, our community, our family, and ourselves. Does evolution really care about hope? As abstract as it seems, hope is a commodity that must be regulated in careful ways by living beings—metered out in quantities only enough to motivate reasonable actions. Hope when unreasonable can be harmful, even deadly. Every organism must ask in its own way: when to struggle on, and when to save energy and reduce risk by waiting out the storm? Rage or rest, fight or hibernate, cry or not—all life needs to make ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=721))

- such choices, to compute the harshness of the present world—and if the challenge cannot be overcome, to withdraw from the fray. The circuitry of hope control needs to work, and work well. With the high heat of our primate lifestyle—a quarter of our calories are burned by the brain alone—the ancient circuitry of withdrawing from actions may extend in our lineage to the giving up of hope itself, of a sometimes costly conceit occupying our brains rather than our muscles. Ancient and conserved circuits were already available to help our evolution build this capability—even cold-blooded fish can make the choice to meet adversity with passivity rather than with action. In 2019 cells were studied across the entire brain of the tiny zebrafish (related to us as a fellow vertebrate, with a backbone and much the same basic brain plan, but small enough and transparent enough to let us see all the way through, using light to access most of its cells during behavior). Two deep structures in the fish brain, called the habenula and the raphé, were observed to work together in guiding this transition from active to passive coping with a challenge (the passive coping state is where the fish will no longer try to expend effort to meet a challenge). Neuronal activity in the habenula (provided by optogenetics) was discovered to favor passive coping (essentially not moving during a challenge); in contrast, activity in the raphé (source of most of the neurochemical called serotonin in the brain) favored active coping (vigorous engagement with the problem). By optogenetically stimulating or inhibiting the habenula, it was possible to instantaneously turn down or up the simple likelihood of the fish expending energy to meet a challenge—and when the raphé was optogenetically controlled instead, the coping effects observed were opposite to those seen with habenula manipulation. Years earlier, optogenetics and other methods had implicated these same two structures in mammals, in the same basic kind of behavioral state transitions, and with the same directionality of effect in each structure. Now seeing these results emerging in the distantly related zebrafish, it could be said with confidence that the biological foundation of suppressing action, when good outcomes are nearly impossible, is ancient, and conserved, and powerful—and thus likely to be important for survival. Any small animal can find a crevice or a burrow and stop moving to cope passively with adversity. Even the tiny nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans appears to calculate the relative value of actively foraging or remaining in place, with the full power of its 302 neurons. But larger brains contemplate many more possible actions and outcomes, ruminating and worrying, mapping out decision trees thickly ramified with possibilities projecting far into the future. A passivity of thought is also needed, perhaps—a deep discounting of the value of one’s actions, and also of one’s own thoughts.

- Mania cannot be trivialized or romanticized. As interesting as the state is—and as euphoric as the patients can be, at least briefly uplifting all around them with their contagious belief in what might be possible—mania is destructive. In the vulnerable, those predisposed to bipolar disorder, mania is often not threat-triggered at all, and does not even approach utility; rather, it is unpredictable and can be accompanied by psychosis, a breakdown in the process of thinking, the catastrophe of suicidal depression, and death.

- Human evolution clearly has not converged upon a single or ideal strategy for sustained mood elevation, if there can be one, and many different genes are linked to bipolar disorder. Telling the stories of past struggles in human evolution, our genomes are laden with other first-pass fixes that still need refinement. Across much of modern medicine outside of psychiatry, it has long been possible to ask, and even answer, why a genetic disease might be common. To explain the persistence of the blood disease sickle-cell anemia, for example, we can tell stories of our coexistence with the microbial parasite ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=995))

- Plasmodium malariae, which evolved along with us, driving adaptation of our blood cells and immune systems in an agonizing call-and-response playing out over millions of years. Sickle-cell disease and the related diseases called thalassemias (a classical name, for their Mediterranean distribution) are burdens borne by many modern human beings who share peri-equatorial genetic roots, where Plasmodium and its mosquito carrier thrive. The burden takes the form of mutations in hemoglobin, the protein in our red blood cells that delivers oxygen to mitochondria (like Plasmodium once immigrant microbes, our mitochondria are now fully symbiotic partners in our survival). Plasmodium lives in our red blood cells if it can get in, and these mutations in hemoglobin work against this ancient enemy, suppressing malaria as they block the spread of Plasmodium through the blood. The mutations also, however, bring the risk of misshapen red blood cells that cause disease symptoms: pain, infection, and stroke. As in cystic fibrosis, the human carriers with one mutant gene usually have no symptoms, and it is only when two mutant genes come together that the sickle-cell disease state is created. But unlike those who carry a single cystic fibrosis gene (at least as far as we understand it today), sickle-cell carriers (the nondiseased, carriers of only one mutation) have a clear benefit, resisting malaria and thus revealing a harsh evolutionary bargain: a steep price is paid only by those with two copies of the mutation for a benefit enjoyed by others with one copy, who do not suffer. Thus these mutations are ragged measures, quick hacks, still jousting in the tortuously slow arena of natural selection. The lesson of the sickle cell is that the disease, and the diseased, make sense together only in the broader frame of the human family and its evolution. Though it is not always easy for scientists to find these perspectives, the simple fact of achieving an explanation has been important, helping to liberate us from the grip of mysticism and blame. Psychiatry, however, has continued without such insight. More consequential than any other type of disease in terms of the immensity of death, disability, and suffering caused around the world, mental illnesses nevertheless have remained essentially unexplained in this way, and no definitive explanation is possible now. Yet neuroscience has reached a tipping point. For the first time, scientific explanations for what these illnesses are, biologically, seem within reach—and as with sickle cell, as with all of human health and disease, the prevalence of mental illness should be informed by evolutionary considerations; as Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote in 1973, nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. But thinking about survival and reproduction trade-offs can be misleading if the questions asked are naïve or incomplete. For example, the harm of psychiatric disease to patients seems clear, but who would be… ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=999))

- persist? With the sickle-cell trait, those who receive the benefit are not the same as those who suffer. Is this also the case for mental illness, that there is some benefit only for close relatives? Or alternatively, could it be that the mentally ill do directly benefit—at some time, in some way? We must acknowledge that the present-day world could provide no answer—evolution is slow, while cultural changes are fast, and society is not close to a steady state. We are likely to be imperfectly suited for our world as a result. But there is hope for understanding; those traits and states we do have likely mattered for survival until very recently, if not right up to the present. What doesn’t matter for survival quickly disappears, leaving only traces, footprints in the damp sand of genomes, fading with the waves of generations. In the lineage of mammals, egg yolk genes were lost as soon as milk evolved (though broken fragments of the yolk genes persist, even… ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=1022))

- Neuroscience has made little progress in understanding mania, or the bipolar disorder syndromes, which form a spectrum of severity all sharing a manic-like state. Indeed, mania is not binary but ranges in degree from mild hypomania (a sustainable mood-elevated state not needing hospitalization) to recurrent spontaneous manias (increasingly severe with each episode—psychotic even, with breaks in perception of reality—ending in a dementia-like state if untreated). Neuroscientists interested in mania have explored certain types of brain cells with relevance to the core symptoms. For example, dopamine neurons have attracted attention for their known roles in guiding motivation and reward seeking—elements clearly overabundant in mania, on display in that remarkable symptom we call “increased goal-directed behavior,” and exemplified in the numerous projects, investments, plans, and energy of Alexander’s rebirth. Circadian rhythm circuits have also been pursued, since one of the most striking features of mania—used in diagnosis as well, and prominent in Alexander—is a profoundly decreased need for sleep. This symptom is especially interesting since mania does not cause poor sleep per se (nor attendant problems that come with the poor sleep of insomnia such as lethargy, somnolence, and the like). In mania there is a true decreased need for sleep—as Alexander experienced—with maintained high functioning of brain and body over prolonged periods, and very little rest taken or required.

- What other genes relevant to mania are found in human beings? Bipolar disorders are heritable, running strongly in families, but there are few single genes that, by themselves, can determine the disorder—in fact, there may be dozens of genes or more that each contribute small effects, as with height. A few of these genes have turned up fairly consistently with scanning of whole human genomes in studies of type I bipolar—the kind with spontaneous and severe manias, among the most strongly heritable of psychiatric diseases. ANK3 is one ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=1063))

- such gene, which directs the production of a protein called ankyrin 3 (also known as ankyrin G), which organizes the electrical infrastructure of the initial segment of the axon—the first section of each threadlike output wire, that electrical-information transmission line connecting each brain cell with all of its receivers across the brain. These mutations, which contribute to causing bipolar disorder in some people, likely lead to insufficient ankyrin 3 production. In 2017 a mouse line was created with “knocked out”—insufficient—ankyrin 3. These initial segments of the axon were indeed poorly organized in the knockout mice as a result, in an interesting way. Inhibitory synapses that would normally be clustered at that crucial spot of the axon, acting like dampers to prevent overexcitation, were gone. And the mice showed some manic-like properties: much higher physical activity levels, in terms of both general locomotion and movements specifically directed toward overcoming stressful challenges—that is, elevated goal-directed behavior. Amazingly, this pattern could be blocked in the mice by medications, including lithium, that are highly effective for bipolar in human beings. As interesting as ANK3 is to psychiatrists and neuroscientists, in human beings its mutations cannot alone explain all mania, and bipolar disorder in general is far from understood. We also do not understand the association of mania with depression—that other “pole” of bipolar. Manias frequently end in deep depression, and ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08JKLLQVQ&location=1067))

- many patients cycle from up states to down states: mania to depression, or depression to hypomania and back—but nobody knows why, and the ANK3 studies do not offer an answer. Is there a neural resource of some kind that is consumed by mania, leading to a slide into depression? Or perhaps instead there is overcorrection from a system responsible for turning off mania when the threat is past, but occasionally overshooting? An imprecise hack indeed—one that in the past could be tolerated by our species as a whole, if not so much by those living with it.

- The phrase was borderline personality disorder (a label of the moment in psychiatry that may change in time to something more reflecting symptoms, like emotional dysregulation syndrome—but which, regardless of label, describes something constant and universal, a fundamental part of the human heart). These three deceptively simple words clarified Henry’s chaos for me, made some sense of his bewildering complexity, and in particular explained the positioning of his mind on the border between unreal and real, between unstable and stable. He was blocking the light’s path to deflect the harshness of the knowledge it carried, protecting his raw and damaged depths, asserting crude control of what could flow into his body across the border of his skin.
