## Highlights
- Postscript: Abandon the Fight against Aging Our culture fears old age. We segregate older persons physically, just as we repress the awareness of our own aging. We do so at our own peril because most of us will live twenty, thirty, even forty years after age sixty. The experts tell us that to live a full and rich life we should instead increase our awareness of our own aging. Denial is our worst enemy: we fail to plan for later life and we pointlessly fear a negative future that may never occur. The five lessons in this chapter focus on awareness and adaptation to aging. Here’s the refrigerator list: 1. Being old is much better than you think. Don’t waste your time worrying about getting old. It can ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2173))

- REMEMBER, YOU ONLY GET one chance to go through this life. Don’t ruin it for yourself by doing something foolish. Be safe. Be careful. What you do now, you will always remember. You’ll always feel joy or regret about it happening. A friend who was going to a high school reunion told me, “The best part is I can look every single one of the other people there in the eye and be proud, and not have regrets or be embarrassed.” Think about that when you start to do something you might regret.

- These elders typically attributed the failure of the marriage to not making the time and effort to gain a deep knowledge of their partner before marrying. This is what they urge the rest of us to avoid: marrying the wrong person. As Phyllis Morton, seventy-eight, said bluntly: “It is better to not marry than to marry the wrong person. Both my husband and I were married once before and it took that experience to learn this lesson. We both learned it, and we’re happy now.” ([Location 2519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2519))

- The potential danger of the “romantic phase” was a frequent cautionary note struck by the experts. As Sarah Palmer, eighty-four, another divorced but happily remarried expert, put it: WELL, PEOPLE AREN’T ALWAYS what they seem. It’s very bad if you don’t really know them until after you marry them. My husband, I thought he wanted the same things I did and I found out he didn’t have any idea what I wanted and I really didn’t have any idea what he wanted. And the things we wanted were totally and completely different, like night and day. That was a rather large, large error, but I was so in love with him that I couldn’t see anything else, and that’s a big problem. Henry David responded without hesitation to the question about how to have a happy marriage: choose carefully. He told me that taking additional time is something of an insurance policy against later regret: ([Location 2525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2525))

- Kate’s message is clear: taking the time to know someone before marriage can prevent years, or even decades, of difficulty as life goes on. So whether you are a young person embarking on a first marriage or someone in middle age thinking of the “second time around,” you have a golden opportunity for regret prevention. As Jeff Baylor, ninety-one, told me: “When you think you’ve found your true life partner, think twice, three times, or however many times it takes before you take the step into marriage. Investigate it more thoroughly than any other decision, weigh your options, and in particular examine your motives. If you are doing it for the wrong reasons, you have every reason to wait.” ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2552))

- In everyday life, people often regret things they’ve said. We lose our temper and let someone have it, only to rue our hasty words. Or we e-mail an off-color joke that comes back to haunt us (and these days, it can travel around the world in a couple of minutes). However, when it comes to deep, long-lasting regret, the experts pointed instead toward things left unsaid. The view from later life is this: if you have something to say to someone, do it before it’s too late. The experts emphasize this lesson either because they are grateful that they spoke up while there was still time or because they profoundly regret not having done so. Ralph Veliz, seventy-two, reinforced this point by offering an insightful aphorism: “Send flowers to the living. The dead never see them.” His rule for regret-free living: do it now. ([Location 2558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2558))

- TELL PEOPLE TO SEND flowers to the living. Because by the time they’re gone, what’s the point in sending them? If you’re going to do it, do it now. Don’t wait until next week to send those flowers to the living because they might not be living then. If you have a grudge against someone, why not make it right, now? Make it right because there may not be another opportunity, who knows? So do what you can do now. It is an interesting paradox that people most often regret things left unsaid in their intimate relationships, where we would expect the most communication. The experts realize (sometimes too late) that marriage becomes the domain of the “taken for granted,” in which feelings are assumed but not expressed. And that’s a source of deep regret for some long-married experts. ([Location 2564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2564))

- Ruth Helm tragically lost her college-age daughter in a plane crash. As we discussed our adult children, she told me with a smile, “You’ll never let go of them, you can’t. So it’s there—you only want everything good for them, you know? And one thing we always did, whenever we would get off the phone we always said, ‘I love you.’ And I was so happy that we did that because when I said good-bye to my daughter the last words that I said to her were ‘I love you.’” ([Location 2598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2598))

- Here’s the refrigerator list for regret reduction: 1. Always be honest. Avoid acts of dishonesty, both big and small. Most people suffer from serious regret later in life if they have been less than “fair and square.” 2. Say yes to opportunities. When offered a new opportunity or challenge, you are much less likely to regret saying yes and more likely to regret turning it down. 3. Travel more. Travel while you can, sacrificing other things if necessary to do so. Most people look back on their travel adventures (big and small) as highlights of their lives and regret not having traveled more. 4. Choose a mate with extreme care. The key is not to rush the decision, taking all the time ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2615))

- needed to get to know the prospective partner and to determine your compatibility over the long term. 5. Say it now. People wind up saying the sad words “it might have been” by failing to express themselves before it’s too late. Don’t believe the “ghost whisperers”—the only time you can share your deepest feelings is while people are still alive.

- Alice Rosetto, eighty-five, encourages us to practice self-acceptance as a way of getting over regrets: WHAT I HAVE LEARNED from the mistakes that I’ve made is that you can’t change what’s happened in the past. You have to accept yourself, warts and all. That was hard for me, because I came out of a background that was telling me if you kept trying harder, you really could do it all right and be perfect. It took me some time to accept the fact that it’s not going to work that way. And it’s okay that it doesn’t work that way, so it’s really self-acceptance. Once a decision is made or a direction is started, you don’t get anywhere by looking back and second-guessing it. And as somebody taught me years ago: if you’ve bought a pair of shoes, don’t look at the shoes in the next store window.

- YOU SHOULD BE KIND to other people, but you also should try to be gentle with yourself. I grew up in a family where there was a lot of worry and a lot of expectations for performance and a lot of guilt. But it’s very important as you get older to be gentle with yourself and appreciate who you are, because people are so hard on themselves. Try not to be too judgmental. Take it easy—take it easy on yourself. The wisest Americans agreed upon this last lesson about regrets: when you get to their age, you eventually need to forgive yourself. If a choice or decision still troubles us after many years, our elders give us permission to lighten up and forgive ourselves. I suggest we take it.

- A Latin aphorism has come into common usage: “carpe diem.” Made famous by the movie Dead Poets Society, it is usually translated as “seize the day.” The meaning of the original Latin, however, is closer to “harvesting” the day. It is in this sense that the experts endorse carpe diem: that each day has an unharvested abundance of pleasure, enjoyment, love, and beauty that many younger people miss. A very common human failing, they argue, is not taking advantage of life’s pleasures and attending to the very joy of being alive. Indeed a number of the experts (Jews and non-Jews alike) quoted a phrase from the Talmud: “We will be held accountable for all the permitted pleasures we failed to enjoy.” ([Location 2724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2724))

- to be very different from what we had planned. The experts tell us to strive for happiness with what we are given, right now, and to make this perspective a daily habit.

- to them. If you feel annoyance, fear, or disappointment, these feelings are caused by you and must be dug out like a weed. Study where they came from, accept them, and then let them go.

- Rather than this “happy if only” viewpoint, which is so prevalent among younger people, the experts have a radically different idea. They insist not only that we can choose to be happy but that we can choose to do so on a daily basis in spite of the problems that confront us or the lack of something we feel is very important to us. They believe that individuals can change and influence their own attitudes in spite of external stresses and even tragedy. And they argue that it is a tremendous mistake to wait for external events to “make” you happy. This “happiness in spite of” perspective of the elders provides us with some of most hopeful news possible about making the most of life. Namely, that the choice to be happy can—indeed must—occur in the face of life’s most daunting difficulties. ([Location 2815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2815))

- It’s a fact that life will hand us problems and difficulties—if that hasn’t happened to you yet, you’re lucky (and probably very young). Despite this fact, we all have the power to choose. We can make a conscious decision each day to embrace a positive attitude. It requires convincing yourself that you can wake up and decide to focus on positive emotions. Lest you think I am painting too rosy a portrait of our elders, it is important to keep in mind that everyone who reaches their seventies and beyond has experienced tragedy of one kind or another. This is indeed one of the fundamental sources of elder wisdom and a reason why we need to attend so closely to what they tell us—no other group in society has this much experiential knowledge. They have become experts in walking ([Location 2898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2898))

- As I spoke back to myself over more than a decade, I found I had a single urgent message I would have liked to deliver: relax and stop worrying. I wanted to let the twenty-four-year-old Karl know that he was poisoning the present moment with future anxiety and that what he really needed to do was to have a modicum of trust and stop worrying so much. In my fantasy I longed to be able to tell my less-mature self, “See, everything turned out okay! You’re wasting this great period in your life by spending so much time worrying about things that may never happen.” My memory of this spontaneous insight made the experts’ accounts of this lesson ring particularly true. Their advice on this issue is devastatingly simple and direct: worry is an enormous waste of ([Location 2922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=2922))

- your precious and limited lifetime. They suggested training oneself to reduce or eliminate worrying as the single most positive step you can make toward greater happiness. The experts conveyed, in urgent terms, that worry is an unnecessary barrier to joy and contentment. And it’s not just what they said—it’s how they said it.

- Sister Clare, one of the most serene people I have ever met, has used this technique for well over three-quarters of a century. SO MANY THINGS COME to your mind. Now, for instance, somebody might hurt your feelings. You’re going to get back at him or her—well, just let it be. Push it away. So I started doing that. I found it the most wonderful thing because everybody has uncharitable thoughts, you can’t help it. Some people get on your nerves and that will be there until you die.

- LEARN THAT LIFE IS good. You have to learn from the problems or the problems overcome you. I’ve learned a lot about life and nothing bothers me anymore. And it gets to be so, and it’s just the way it is. Acceptance, yes. If you don’t accept it, you go down the drain. Be calm, go with the flow. People worry about dying, about everything. I’m not worried at all. As you see, I’m a very easygoing person. And I take life as it is. If I’m going to die tomorrow, then I’ll die tomorrow. How else can you live? Life is short, you have to be open-minded. Very open-minded. Learn to accept instead of worrying—then you will be okay.

- Flora Turnbull, who enlightened me about many facets of elder wisdom, is a poet and what I would call a philosopher of everyday life. At age eighty, she continues to publish poems that express her love of the landscapes of the Southwest. Her approach to living is to embrace the pleasures each day holds, and she reinforces that attitude with a daily habit: I LIKE TO START out the day with a list of ten things that I’d like to do that day. Now, I’m not going to accomplish all of them and probably only one of them is going to work out, but I never know which one, at the beginning of the day. It’s not a “to do” list—it’s just a list of what I would like to try doing. I’m always looking for new things to try. They don’t have to be difficult things—I’m probably not going to take up hang gliding or something like that. Something simple. Finding new opportunities and new challenges each day. If I were to give any particular word of advice, I would say, go about the business of the day, humdrum as it might be, but walk on your tiptoes, waiting for the “aha!” experiences. That happens when you’re going around the corner doing the normal, everyday things. So be prepared for those “aha!” experiences that may happen anytime. That way you’re always ([Location 3100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3100))

- The lesson was typically worded as an endorsement of spirituality itself, however the individual decides to put it into practice. They point to two main reasons why practicing a faith is an important lesson for living: it provides a source of community, and it offers unique help with coping in times of trouble.

- But if you are one of the vast majority of people who does have some belief in a higher power (regardless of how amorphous), then think seriously about the experts’ recommendations that you become involved instead of sitting on the sidelines. In fact, research suggests that church participation provides benefits that cannot be found elsewhere (or at least not easily). No matter what the religion or denomination, people who actually ([Location 3176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3176))

- Here’s the refrigerator list: 1. Time is of the essence. Live as though life is short—because it is. The point is not to be depressed by this knowledge but to act on it, making sure to do important things now. 2. Happiness is a choice, not a condition. Happiness isn’t a condition that occurs when circumstances are perfect or nearly so. Sooner or later you need to make a deliberate choice to be happy in spite of challenges and difficulties. 3. Time spent worrying is time wasted. Stop worrying. Or at least cut down. It’s a colossal waste of your precious lifetime. 4. Think small. When it comes to making the most of your life, think small. Attune yourself to simple daily pleasures and learn to savor them now. ([Location 3279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3279))

- The Golden Rule. Many of you will remember it from Sundayschool classes. When describing their core values, some elders just said those three words: Interviewer: What are the major values or principles you live by? Expert: The Golden Rule. Often they would paraphrase it, offering versions like “Do to others what you want them to do to you,” or “Treat people the way you want to be treated.” Some answers were even more free-form, such as “Do unto others as I wish they’d do unto me,” or “Do unto others and you pay for what you do that is against people,” and ([Location 3297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3297))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the negative version, “Don’t do unto others what you don’t want done unto you.” Very frequently they stopped with the signature three words: “You know, do unto others . . .” Why? I asked myself. Why the Golden Rule? I don’t have any comparison data, but I sincerely doubt that people my age and younger would give the Golden Rule as their guiding principle. Drilling down was a challenge, because many experts found it unnecessary to explain why the Golden Rule was the way to live. So I decided get some help about what the Golden Rule actually means. Fortunately scholars have looked at just this question. Jeffrey Wattles’s book, titled—surprise!—The Golden Rule was the most definitive I could find. The version of the Golden Rule that most of the experts learned in Sunday school comes from the King James Version of the Bible and goes like this: “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.” But one reason why the Golden Rule comes up so ([Location 3303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3303))

- frequently is that every religious tradition has a version of it. Hinduism: “Knowing how painful it is to himself, a person should never do to others what he dislikes when done to him by others.” Judaism: “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.” And Islam: “None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.” Still, I had trouble understanding precisely how it figured so centrally for America’s elders. Obsessed with this issue, I went back and read everything the experts had said about the Golden Rule. And I slowly came to understand what kind of guidance for good living they are proposing. Their reliance on the Golden Rule is at heart an emphasis on compassion. This word perfectly sums up what they were telling me; its literal meaning from the Latin is “suffering with.” “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” means that we must work hard to empathize with other people, to understand their perspectives, to feel as they feel, to see them as fellow travelers along ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3310))

- To be honest, though, most of the experts were pessimistic about the outcome of this book. It’s not that they felt their advice isn’t worthwhile—the opposite is true. They are convinced that younger people can benefit from their long and extraordinary life experience, and they deeply wish that they could be seen as mentors and sages—as they would have been in times past. But they have become convinced that they are irrelevant and that their viewpoint will be seen as archaic. ([Location 3389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3389))

- beginning and an end. But although the individual human being is lost, the legacy doesn’t have to be. We are fortunate that lives overlap in a way that ties even long-past historical periods to the present day. At one point I had a stunning realization. My 102-year-old interviewee was born in 1908. Her grandfather was born around 1850 and told her from personal experience about the Civil War and its aftermath. Take one more step back, and when her grandfather was a young child, the oldest person he ([Location 3413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052REQLK&location=3413))

- TEN QUESTIONS TO ASK THE EXPERTS IN YOUR LIFE 1. What are some of the most important lessons you feel you have learned over the course of your life? If the person has difficulty getting started, try this follow-up question: • If a young person asked you, “What have you learned in your———years in this world,” what would you tell him or her? 2.
