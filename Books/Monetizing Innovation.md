## Highlights
- For the CEO, the executive team, and the R&D chief, this book lays out a battle-tested plan for getting back in control. It is based on the work that Simon-Kucher & Partners has done for hundreds of businesses, including my own. It's a straightforward plan, but not a simple one. Much of it counters the prevailing wisdom. There is no “move fast and break things,” but there is a lot of “look before you leap.” ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=399))

- But Porsche had done its homework. Specifically, it had designed and built the product—the Cayenne—around the price. When most people hear the word “price,” they think of a number. That's a price point. When we use the term price, we are trying to get at something more fundamental. We want to understand the perceived value that the innovation holds for the customer. How much is the customer willing to pay for that value? What would the demand be? Seen in this light, price is both an indication of what customers value and a measure of how much they are willing to pay for that value.

- By any and all measures, the Cayenne was a roaring success. Why did Porsche succeed? It wasn't the company's engineering prowess, although the Cayenne drives quite nicely. And it wasn't a technological breakthrough that ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=491))

- Both cars were equally critical to their companies' futures. However, Fiat Chrysler's approach to developing the Dart was radically different from Porsche's Cayenne. Rather than starting with a hard look at the customer, Fiat Chrysler took a hard look at the product. As it documented in a 90-second TV commercial to market the car,4 Fiat Chrysler's product development process was to design it, build it, rethink it, design it, build it, rethink it—until the engineering team, in its exclusive opinion, felt the car was ready to go. In fact, the advertisement announced proudly that the company was “kicking the finance guys” out of the development process. Money was not going to be an issue. The company would build prototype after prototype to get it right. The executive team “suits” would only interfere with designing the Dart. This car would be built to perfection, the commercial suggested. “Perfection” as defined by Fiat Chrysler, not the customer.

- Then a price was slapped on, and Dodge took it to customers to try to sell it. Market performance was a disaster. In 2012, the year it launched, the Dart sold about 25,000 units5—a quarter of the total predicted by market analysts and a number that caused Dow Jones's MarketWatch to call the Dart the year's second biggest new product flop. The number one spot was given to Apple's buggy iPhone mapping software. That's right: The Dart was “Apple Maps bad.” ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=516))

- reasons product innovations have succeeded or failed at so many companies in so many industries over the last 30 years: Porsche placed customer needs, value, willingness to pay, and pricing in the driver's seat when it developed the Cayenne; Fiat Chrysler stuffed them in the trunk. This story is less about the cars than about the two different modes of thinking that went into launching them, and why one way produced a success that helped put its company on an accelerated growth path while the other produced a flop that led to layoffs. Porsche designed its new car around the price—what the customer valued and wanted to buy; Fiat Chrysler did not. This story illustrates the main theme of this book: How companies bringing something new into the world can leverage the science of monetizing innovation, increase the chances that their new offerings will succeed, and produce results that can be magical. The odds against successful innovation are always high. But, as you read, you'll learn how a focus on monetizing innovation can substantially increase your chances of financial success.

- New products fail for many reasons. But the root of all innovation evil—what billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk would call the set of “first principles”—is the failure to put the customer's willingness to pay for a new product at the very core of product design. Most companies postpone marketing and pricing decisions to the very end, when they've already developed their new products. They embark on the long and costly journey of product development hoping they'll make money on their innovations, but not at all knowing if they will. Price is more than just a dollar figure; it is an indication of what the customer wants—and how much they want it. It is the single most critical factor in determining whether a product makes money, yet it is an afterthought, a last-minute consideration made after a product is developed. It is so much of an afterthought that companies frequently call us and say, “We built a product—oops, now we need your help in pricing it.” To boil it down, these companies conduct product development this way: They design, then build, then market, then price. What we will teach you in this book is to flip that process on its head: Market and price, then design, then build. In other words, design the product around the price. Think back to the last business case you or your colleagues were asked to write for a new product. How did you arrive at your prices? Did you compare your product to other products in the marketplace, or did you actually ask customers what they'd pay for it? Did you know in advance what would happen if you increased your price by, say, 20 percent—that is, how that would likely affect demand and thus volume? If you are like thousands of companies that we've worked with over the years, you probably did not. Every one of them claims to have made an airtight business case to top management that vouches for their new product. But in only about 5 percent of those business cases can you find information on how much customers will pay for the product. This means their revenue estimates are, at best, a guess. When you think about it, that's stunning. The business case gives them a level of confidence they should not have. It leads them down the path to failure. The most successful product innovators we know start by determining what the customer values and what they are willing to pay, and then they design the products around these inputs and have a clear monetization strategy that they follow through with.

- We've found recurring patterns in new product monetization failure. While you might think many types of flaws can cause products to flop in the marketplace, we actually have found that monetizing failures fall into only four categories: Feature shock: cramming too many features into one product—sometimes even unwanted features—creates a product that does not fully resonate with customers and is often overpriced. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=621))

- Minivation: an innovation that, despite being the right product for the right market, is priced too low to achieve its full revenue potential. Hidden gem: a potential blockbuster product that is never properly brought to market, generally because it falls outside of the core business. Undead: an innovation that customers don't want but has nevertheless been brought to market, either because it was the wrong answer to the right question, or an answer to a question no one was asking. The fact that new product monetization failures come in only four varieties should give you comfort. Imagine having to do postmortems that could point to dozens or hundreds of factors! You Can Avoid Failure—but Only If You Play by Different Rules Our experience allowed us not only to diagnose these monetization failure modes but to cure them—or even better, avoid them altogether. In this book, we have boiled these secrets down into the following nine new rules for innovation success. The rules are contrary to what most executives have learned about product development: Have the “willingness to pay” talk with customers early in the product development process. If you don't do it early, you won't be able to prioritize the product features you develop, and you won't know whether you're building something customers will pay for until it's in the marketplace. Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you like it or not, your customers are different, so customer segmentation is crucial. But segmentation based on demographics—the primary way companies group their customers—is misleading. You should build segments based on differences in your customers' willingness to pay for your new product. Product configuration and bundling is more science than art. You need to build them carefully and match them with your most meaningful segments. Choose the right pricing and revenue models, because how you charge is often more important than how much you charge. Develop your pricing strategy. Create a plan that looks a few steps ahead, allowing you to maximize gains in the short and long term. Draft your business case using customer willingness-to-pay data, and establish links between price, value, volume, and cost. Without this, your business case will tell you only what you want to hear, which may be far afield from market realities. Communicate the value of your offering clearly and compellingly; otherwise you will not get customers to pay full measure. Understand your customers' irrational sides, because whether you sell to other businesses or to consumers, your customers are people. You should take into account their full psyches, including their emotions, in making purchase decisions. Maintain your pricing integrity. Control discounting tightly. If demand for your new product is below expectations, only use price cuts as a last resort, after all other measures have been exhausted.

- We don't want to suggest this is easy. Real change never is. Some chapters will teach you tactics that will ratchet up your odds of success all by themselves. But the power of our nine-rule approach lies in how each rule reinforces the one before it. It is an integrated framework, meaning that the true potential of our approach, the real game changer, can only be realized if you commit, body and soul.

- previous chapter, we have analyzed thousands of new product and service monetizing innovation failures for clients over the last 30 years, and we find they fall into four categories: feature shocks, minivations, hidden gems, and undeads. The good news is that there are only four categories! That makes it easier to avoid them. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=704))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Flavor 2: Minivations—When You Ask for Too Little, That's What You Get No one wants to sell his or her idea short. Minivations are products that tap neither a product concept's full market potential nor its full price potential. Companies that fall into the minivation trap underexploit the market opportunity and the price they could have charged, thereby robbing themselves of profits. Minivations go down as undermonetized products cursed with a “what might have been” tag. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=810))

- The component company failed to ask this question: “What value does this component bring to our customer and its customers, and what portion of that value can we capture?” Instead, it asked, “What does this component cost to make, and what minimum margin do I need to add on top of that?” ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=829))

- that are too low. They are tame, safe answers to the right question. In the case of the component manufacturer, their device was wildly underpriced. Why? Its management perpetuated the pricing practice of the past: slapping a predictable margin on top of the previous-generation product. No one challenged the established pricing practice. No one quantified the value to customers and their willingness to pay. They just didn't think big enough from a monetization perspective.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So how do you spot minivations in the making? (See Figure 2.2.) Your team seems comfortable checking the box and lowballing on targets. You find evidence for lack of ambition and a desire to not “overprice.” When the product is out, your sales team often is the canary in the coal mine. Compared to your other products, the sales force is easily meeting its targets with your new product. Your channel partners are reaping their maximum margins.

- Sellouts are popping up. Fewer pricing problems are emerging. If the majority of deals are going through the pipeline without price escalations, you may have underestimated the value of your new product and underpriced it. Tracking the number of price escalations, as well as the length of the sales cycle against historical norms, will give you more hard evidence that something new is occurring.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- recognize it and quantify the product's value to customers. Or the company decides it lacks the capabilities to bring the unusual idea to market. Hidden gems often end up in limbo, neither launched nor killed. They often don't make it to market, but if they do, they arrive undervalued, as freebies or deal sweeteners. Revolutionary product ideas, by virtue of their defining originality, often may seem tangential to a company's core business. Kodak is perhaps the most famous illustration of this. Once the top name that consumers associated with photography, Kodak got clobbered in the digital camera game because it waited too long on the sidelines. The irony: In 1974, a young Kodak engineer in the company's applied research lab, Steven Sasson, had invented a hidden gem: the technology behind digital cameras. Kodak patented the initial technology, and Sasson kept the prototype as he moved around the company. In other words, Kodak could have been the king of the digital camera market— ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=883))

- an industry whose products are integral to hundreds of millions of smartphones, not just the point-and-shoot cameras we've all used for years. But the notion of a digital camera threatened the core business at Kodak: film. So it remained hidden for far too long. Exactly how do hidden gems stay hidden? In Kodak's case, Sasson's bosses never got excited about it. Kodak didn't introduce its first digital camera, the DC40, until 1995, 21 years after Sasson's breakthrough, and it didn't get serious about its digital camera effort until 2001.5 With no foothold in that new digital world, Kodak declared bankruptcy in 2012, emerged in 2013, and as of 2015 was trying to resurrect its business largely by licensing its patents and research technologies. Banking firms now own most of the company. None of this had to happen. None of it was preordained. Kodak had a hidden gem way back in 1974. It just couldn't bring itself to exploit it.

- Kodak is hardly the only company to bury its hidden gems. We recently met a manufacturer of warehouse conveyor belts that had developed software that dramatically improved the flow of goods (within the warehouse). Because it was a hardware manufacturer, selling software was a foreign concept. So the company had given away its breakthrough software, thinking the real value was in the hard goods it made. It had squandered millions of dollars in revenue for a product—lines of code—for which it could have charged a hefty price. This was confirmed when we talked to its customers: a majority of them had a significant willingness to pay for the software (on top of the hardware).

- Flavor 4: Undeads—When Nobody Wants Your Product The term “undead” historically has been used in fiction to refer to dead people who come back to life, such as vampires and zombies. Applied to monetizing innovation, an undead product is one that still exists in the marketplace, but demand is virtually nonexistent. The product, for all intents and purposes, is dead, yet it continues to “walk around” like a zombie. How do undeads happen? They occur when a new product is the wrong answer to the right question—or an answer to a question that not enough people care about. These products emerge from organizations that struggle to separate the technically feasible from the commercially practical. Undeads hit the market with an almost audible thud and poor sales.

- Undeads are born in hugely successful companies as well. Take online search engine leader Google. In 2012, the company unveiled Google Glass, a pair of glasses with a small camera that, upon verbal command, could take pictures or record videos. The wearer could also look up at Glass and see maps and other information found on smartphones. According to Google, the consumer didn't need to touch anything to get some of the features ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=960))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- of a smartphone. Google made the first version of Glass available to the digerati and journalists for the princely price of $1,500. The idea was that they'd fall in love with Glass and use their online pulpits to urge others to buy it. Only, it didn't happen that way. Reviewers panned it for shortcomings such as its short battery life and glitches. And the device spooked people who feared that nearby Glass wearers would record moments they'd prefer to keep private. Because of this privacy concern, a number of theaters, bars, casinos, and other public places prohibited patrons from wearing Glass. A year later, in January 2015, Google announced the end of its Glass product.9 Google Glass was an undead product for its initial target audience: everyday consumers using smartphones. We believe that had Google targeted commercial applications as its primary segment—surgeons and other professionals who need information rapidly while their hands are doing vital work—and focused and developed the product for ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=963))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the business segment, Glass might not have been born undead. For the broad consumer segment, however, Google Glass answered a question no one was asking. By the way, technology companies like Segway and Google aren't the primary sources of undeads. They go well beyond tech. Consumer product companies collectively have hundreds of undead products they try hard to forget. Remember when Coca-Cola introduced “New Coke” in 1985? Facing pressure from Pepsi, Coke tweaked its recipe for the first time in almost a century. Consumers didn't love the new taste—and they hated that the old Coke had disappeared from store shelves. Within three months, the company salvaged the situation by returning the old Coke, now called Coke Classic (using the original recipe), to the shelves.10 ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=971))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It's easy to recognize that your innovation is undead. (See Figure 2.4.) When an undead is in the making, you become delusional and detest any evidence that goes against your beliefs. You resist objectivity and keep investing time, feeling you have come too far. Once the product is in the market, your sales teams can't sell it, and it causes them to miss their targets—by a lot. Salespeople don't want to bring the product into conversations with customers for fear of poisoning relationships. Meanwhile, customers either say they don't want the product or say they find it intriguing, but not intriguing enough to buy. Press coverage and social media posts turn negative and sarcastic. That's what ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=990))

- If innovators are to succeed, this thinking goes, they must be given lots of runway. In the United States, the popular portrait of the innovator combines artistic spirit with the image of an underdog. Apple appealed to this in 1997 upon Steve Jobs's return to the company, using artistic icons like Miles Davis (a rebellious artist) in its Think Different campaign. Using this mindset, asking product developers to think about pricing and willingness to pay infringes on their creativity. In coming up with the initial advertising concept in 2012 for its new Dodge Dart, the Fiat Chrysler TV ad mentioned in Chapter 1 played to this widely and deeply held mindset. “Kick out the finance guys!” the commercial proudly proclaimed. The ad played into the prevailing mindset of what happens when a firm introduces the bean counters too early into product development: Big, bold ideas ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1072))

To use baseball terminology, today's businesses believe the more often you step up to the plate, the more swings you take, the better your chance of hitting a home run.

- Of all the chapters in this book, this one might surprise you the most. In it, we will explain why you absolutely must discuss pricing at the beginning of a new product development initiative, not at the end. As mentioned in Chapter 1, when we say price we mean it to be an indication of what customers value and a measure of how much they are willing to pay for that value. To build a product around a price, you must engage in deep discussions with potential customers before you design and develop it. Your dialogue must be specifically about their willingness to pay for the product you have in mind. The term “willingness to pay” is so ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1148))

- As the Gillette story shows, it is critical to start the conversation with customers about their willingness to pay for your product before you begin building it. The early WTP talk will help you in three essential ways: It will tell you right away whether you have an opportunity to monetize your product—or not. It will help you prioritize features and design the product with the right set of features. It will enable you to avoid the four types of failures. Early WTP talks help you avoid feature shocks by restraining you from overloading your product with unnecessary features that in turn force you to price it too high. They prevent minivations by giving you critical information on how much your customers value your product, and how much they're willing to pay for that value. That ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1185))

- information will give you the courage not to price your product too low. The early WTP talk will also help you identify the hidden gems in your firm by arming you with the proof that there is indeed a market for these ideas. Your firm is far more likely to regard them seriously and invest resources to harness them. Last, the early WTP talk will save you from bringing an undead product to market. If customers tell you they're not willing to pay the price you need to make money from your product, that will save you lots of anguish later.

We see this scenario over and over again: A company guesses what customers will value about its product and what they'd pay for it. Don't just hope; find out! Amazon could have found out whether customers valued the 3-D features in the Fire Phone. Validate feature value and willingness to pay, and you'll build far more successful products.

But if you are like most of our clients, you are a little nervous about discussing pricing with customers before you have a product. How does one do that? The simplest way is to ask direct questions about the value of your product and its features, for example: ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1269))

It is important to put this group through the types of questions you would ask customers. This would also serve as a pilot test before you take it to customers. Send out the questions before the meeting and ask participants to show up with answers (to avoid behavior in the room that generates biased answers). Then conduct an objective discussion of why people answered the way they did. Position customer discussions as the “value talk:” Don't position the talk as “pricing” or “willingness to pay.” Rather, frame the talk as “we want to talk about our latest innovation ideas and how we can continue to add value for you.” This positioning is essential to get customers in the right mindset. Start by asking customers about their pain points, and pitch your product's features and the value they would bring. Ask questions like “Do you value these products/features?” and then ask why.

If your product is totally new and you cannot articulate its value to customers, they really won't be able to respond well to your WTP questions. Hence, you need to focus on talking value with customers before you ask them about pricing. Valuable insights already come from the simplest questions: Direct questions often yield important insights. Typically, we find customers would pay the acceptable price (see Figure 4.3) and love the product. They might pay the expensive price, but they wouldn't be thrilled about it.

- The average response can be misleading. For instance, for two groups of customers, one willing to pay $20 and another willing to pay $100, if you calculated the average price they would pay, it would be $60. But that would leave money on the high side (the group that would pay $100) and make your product unaffordable to the low side (they'll only pay $20). You might be better off building the product to a $100 price point or—even better—making two versions, one at $20 (with different features or materials) and the other at $100.

We have not found a single market where customer needs are homogeneous. Yet, time and again, companies design products for the “average” customer. The reality is your customers are different, whether you like it or not. They have very different needs, differing abilities to pay, and they vary by the degree to which they value your product's key benefits. The only way to cope with this variance is to embrace customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the most talked about and at the same time the most misused concept in product design. Why?

- But the biggest insight from the research was something different: There were significant differences on what was valued across customer groups. The firm's packaging customers could be segmented in four very different ways, each with distinct needs and WTP for features that met those needs: A “want price only” segment. These customers primarily cared about getting a low price. Tech service and delivery terms were unimportant, and they were not willing to pay extra for them. And in terms of product quality, as long as the product met their minimum requirements, they were fine. A “want it now” segment. This group was largely interested in speedy delivery. Because their own customers often needed packaging in a rush, this segment depended on suppliers that could respond quickly, and thus they were willing to pay for fast delivery. A “want product only” segment. This segment coveted product performance and quality above all other features. Service, delivery, and speed were least important. A “want the best” segment. This was the least price-sensitive group, and it emphasized quality and service features.

- The paper company used segmentation to drive the way it designed new products based on the needs, value, and willingness to pay data. Is that what you're doing? Probably not. Most businesses do segmentation, but many are ineffective because of these three pitfalls: Segmenting too late. Many companies start out with a one-size-fits-all approach to product development and use segmentation only to determine their marketing and sales messages. But if they don't design offerings to suit the needs of each segment, they run the risk of creating products no segment gets excited about. For example, if you have two customer segments and you design offerings for the “average” customer across both segments, you end up building a product neither group is fully happy about. You can try to repair the damage through sales and marketing segmentation fixes—essentially, tailoring messages that appeal to each segment. But it's too late by that point. You still have only one product to suit a range of diverse and sometimes incompatible customer needs. Segmenting only by observable characteristics.

Having too many segmentation schemes.

Ideally, your company will settle on one segmentation scheme used by all your firm's functions so you have a unified approach to servicing your customers. Worst case, you must reduce your number of segmentation schemes. If you have more than three, you are headed for organizational confusion.

- Successful innovators build the right product for the right segment at the right price. They use segmentation as a guiding influence, starting with the R&D stages of an innovation. They constantly explore how customer needs, value, and WTP differ in the market, and how they can act differently to shape products and versions differently for different segments. If there's capacity to build only one product (for example, in a startup), the company prioritizes and builds that product for the segment with the biggest opportunity (either in terms of size or revenue potential), while creating a plan to introduce future products for other segments. In all these ways, successful companies avoid building a one-size-fits-none new product. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1475))

- Summary We have not found a single market where customer needs are homogeneous. Yet, time and again, companies design products for the “average” customer. The message here is clear: You need to create segments in order to design highly attractive products for each segment. And you must base your segmentation on customers' needs, value, and WTP. This way, segmentation becomes a driver of product design and development, not an afterthought. The following tips are among those that have helped numerous companies do segmentation right: Begin with WTP data; let common sense be your guide; create fewer segments, not more; don't try to serve every segment; and describe segments in detail in order to address them. Understanding customers' needs and WTP will give you segmentation power. And segmentation power, in turn, is what gives you monetization power.

- So you've segmented your customer base along the lines we laid out in Chapter 5: on their needs, the value of your offering, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for that value. Now you're ready to get down and dirty into the design of what you'll offer each customer segment—exactly what features and functions to deliver. There are two core design decisions you will need to make here. One is product configuration, and the other is bundling. This chapter will examine and illustrate these important design constructs. But first, a clarification: Our definition of product configuration refers to the decision of which features and functionalities will be included in a product. In some industries, like software and tech, product configuration is also referred to by the term packaging. By bundling, we mean combining a product or service with other products and services.

- To maximize the monetization potential of new products, companies should curb their instincts to please customers by giving away value-added functionality—unless those customers will pay for it. These firms must get comfortable with the idea of giving their low-price segment only basic quality and service levels, rather than giving them everything. In other words, product configuration requires the guts to take away features. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=1593))

- Product configuration and bundling are your key building blocks for designing the right products for the right segments at the right price points. Product configuration is about putting the appropriate features and functionality—those customers need, value, and are willing to pay for—into the product; this process has to be done for each identified segment. Systematic product configuration prevents you from loading too many features into a product and producing a feature shock. Bundling means selling your products and/or services together. If done right, this will increase total profit because customers end up buying more than if the products were sold stand-alone. Also, customer satisfaction will go up because the buying decision is easier. Successful bundling benefits both you and your customer.

- Setting price by distance traveled delivered benefits to both Michelin and its trucking customers. The new approach allowed fleet managers to pay for performance rather than simply the privilege of owning Michelin rubber. What's more, it gave industrial vehicle owners the flexibility to manage costs appropriately in good times and bad times. If a recession set in, reducing demand for products shipped by truck and thus demand for trucking services, fleet owners would pay less for those tires since they were being charged by the kilometer, not by the tire.

- Michelin took on the customer's cost of product problems; if a tire fails early, Michelin bears the risk. On the flip side, when tires exceed quality expectations—say, when they last 20 percent longer than before—Michelin generates 20 percent more revenue per tire. Michelin's new monetization model allowed the firm to fully capitalize on its new invention—that is, to monetize a tire that lasted much longer than the previous generation did. And Michelin did this without having to spend more on sales and marketing to convince customers these new-fangled tires were worth the premium they were being asked to pay. Michelin simply changed its monetization model. It was a brilliant move. Michelin soon boasted the biggest profits in the industry; by 2011, its earnings before interest and taxes were 25 percent higher than Bridgestone's and more than three times Goodyear's.

- However, selecting the wrong monetization model can have just as significant an impact. A European trucking company found this out soon after signing a three-year contract to distribute a TV manufacturer's goods. The distributor charged the TV set maker a fixed price per TV delivered. Over time the size of the TVs increased exponentially, which meant the distributor couldn't fit as many TVs into each truck as it used to, and thus had to make more truck runs. Costs increased massively, but revenue did not because of the fixed price. Hence, the TV distributor ultimately lost money on the deal. The TV set distributor learned a harsh lesson: Monetarily, a bad monetization model can be worse than a bad price.

- Summary Monetization models can confer significant competitive advantage on a new product or service. How you charge trumps how much you charge. As the Michelin case showed, when done right, the best monetization models are a win-win for you and your customers. Companies have countless monetization choices, but these five work well for most new product monetization: subscription, alternate metric, dynamic pricing, auction, and freemium. You can also combine pieces of these five models for a mix-and-match model. Furthermore, by instituting two price structures (volume-based and matrix), you have the flexibility to adjust for different levels of usage.

- Summary A pricing strategy is your short- and long-term monetization plan. The best companies document their pricing strategies and make it a living and breathing document. Documenting your pricing strategy will help get the executives in your company on the same page; more important, it will help keep you accountable. The price strategy document should have four building blocks. First, set clear goals and prioritize among conflicting goals (for instance, price to maximize revenue but ensure a 10 percent profit increase). Second, pick one of the three types of pricing strategies: maximization, skimming, or penetration. Third, set price-setting principles that define the rules of your monetization models, price differentiation, price endings, price floors, and price increases. Finally, define your promotional and competitive reaction principles to avoid knee-jerk price reactions. Companies that have well-defined pricing strategies are 40 percent more likely to realize their monetizing potential than firms that don't have them.

- Here are nine steps to build a business case that will maximize the value of your new products or services over time. The first is the most important: Forget the way you do business cases today. Nearly every business case we've reviewed in our firm's 30-plus years of business is a static document whose purpose is securing funding for a new product. By static, we mean it's created once to get funding approval, and then it's put on a shelf where it collects dust. Instead, a business case must be a living document, one you update before and after launch with new data on pricing, costs, volume, and value. You can use it to test assumptions about these four elements and how they interact with one another throughout the product life cycle, not just at the funding stage. It will help you respond effectively to competitors' moves before and after your new offering hits the market. Assemble the basic ingredients. Incorporate market size, volume, customer segments, offer structure (configurations and bundles), value, WTP, a monetization model, costs, and competing products and their pricing.

- Include price elasticity. Most companies avoid exploring price elasticity at this point, but we find it to be the critical element in business cases. When the price of a product goes up, sales volume tends to go down. If you've included that dynamic in your business case, you can make more accurate and better decisions if you add features that affect pricing. For example, you'll know how much volume will go down if you raise your price. Now the tough discussions can begin: Do we really need a certain feature that's costing us a lot and driving up our price? Do customers value it? What is the demand? Apply data-verified facts. You need to use figures based on real facts. Without data, many are tempted to overstate the size of their target market, for example, or to create unrealistic adoption assumptions. Such guesses will come back to haunt you later, when you have to explain why sales are grossly under target. Topics that typically require data-validity checks include market size, ramp-up times, churn, and cannibalization assumptions. Add risk assumptions. You need to attach risk assumptions to any input parameters that are inherently uncertain. For example, your manufacturing cost per unit will increase if a key supplier goes belly up and you must source from higher-priced suppliers.

- that's possible, you must mention that in your business case. To pressure-test your business case, you should add these risks and calculate best- and worst-case outcomes of input parameters. A more sophisticated tactic would be using Monte Carlo simulations. They will enable you to gauge the probabilities of your projected outcomes and model uncertainty using probabilistic distributions. Software such as Oracle's Crystal Ball (a popular plug-in to Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet software) allows you to model such assumptions easily.3 Be realistic about goal tradeoffs. It's nearly impossible to maximize a new product's profit, revenue, volume, and margin all at once. You have to prioritize your goals. Raising prices almost always lowers volume and thus revenue. Lower prices typically increase volume. Understanding and making these trade-offs through “what if” scenarios is a key ingredient for a best-in-class business case. Consider competitive reactions.

If the new product will cannibalize sales of existing products, you must factor that in. And, of course, if it cannibalizes too much, you won't have a strong business case. Keep checking in. A strong business case will help you make decisions throughout the product development process and beyond.

- Summary Products are almost never launched without some sort of business case. But 95 percent of the business cases we've seen are built from the inside out, not the outside in. Consequently, they fail to account for critical market information, particularly customer WTP and price elasticity. If you don't know what your customers will pay for your new product and how demand changes when you change the price, you simply don't have a business case. Without this information, your business case will only tell you what you want to hear. Moreover, most business cases are static documents, employed to gain budget approval. Once the money has been allocated, they are quickly forgotten. That's a very limited use of a powerful tool. A business case that's a living, breathing document will help you figure out how to react effectively once your product hits the market and theory becomes practice. To create this kind of business plan, you need to gather data on the four pillars: value, price, cost, and volume. Then you must integrate them because they all affect ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=2677))

They buy the benefits that these products and their suppliers offer to them.” It sounds easy, but consider this: You have thought about your innovation for months or even years. You know the product inside and out. However, a salesperson may only have 10 minutes with the customer. Your customer might stay on your website only for five minutes. An advertisement may only run for 15 seconds. That marketing message, that sales pitch, and that ad must clearly articulate the value to customers in a very short ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=2715))

If you can't clearly communicate that value, how can you expect customers to understand why they need your new offering and why they should pay for it? While it sounds simple in theory, we routinely see companies struggle with crafting their value communication when it comes to new products.

- All of us are subject to behavioral pricing every day. Consider what happens when you walk into a movie theater. When you belly up to the concession stand, do you wonder why the price of the large soda ($5.99 at a theater near one of us) is just a buck more than the $4.99 small soda? The reason is the price of the small serving makes the large one seem less expensive, and thus more attractive, even if you're not that thirsty and the small soda is all you really want. Such offers, promoted to make another product look better, are called anchors. The small soda makes the more expensive option look like a bargain, and who can resist a bargain? That's the only reason for a $4.99 small soda at all. Price anchors are one of several pricing tactics that play to the irrational side of customers.

- Unusually high sales could be a high-class problem. This is the hardest problem to acknowledge, and it requires the same disciplined solutions as unexpectedly low sales. You launch your new product and a wonderful thing happens: Sales volumes are way beyond expectations. Time to celebrate? Not so fast. You actually might have a problem—pricing lower than you needed to and leaving money on the table. That, of course, means you have a minivation. Did you simply misjudge your market size, as PlayMobil did when demand outstripped its supply? Or does your main competitor have manufacturing problems? Of course, higher-than-expected sales is a good problem to have. That's why most companies do not view it as a problem or, if they do, they do not examine it. But too-high sales should be examined as rigorously as disappointing sales. So, once again, use a cross-functional team to find out the key reasons for the bigger-than-expected success. Then develop a plan that solves this “problem.” If your product delivered more value than you thought customers were expecting, raise your price. But do it carefully, and in several steps.

- Summary Losing price integrity with a new product means you're cutting prices unnecessarily or too soon when sales are slower than expected. That erodes profit, customer lifetime value, and your brand. To maintain price integrity, you need to take a cross-functional approach to diagnosing the problem. It may turn out you don't have a pricing problem at all. It may be the inability to communicate the substantial value of your product, a quality problem, a sales-force training problem, or another problem. Don't assume first that you put the wrong price on your product. That requires patience. Successful innovators teach their teams how to avoid confusing pricing problems with the quality and communications problems that can beset a new product. They do not approve price cuts before their team has suggested at least three nonprice actions that could be taken. If demand for the product far exceeds expectations, examine this “problem” rigorously as well. If the analysis suggests a large price increase, implement this in several small steps. Raising prices too fast can generate a customer revolt. ([Location 3345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=3345))

How would the suggested measures solve the problems we identified? Does the way our product is perceived in the marketplace (by customers, channel partners, and so on) match the way we perceived it in our planning/business case? If not, what are we doing to correct that? If competitors decreased their prices, why did they do so? What could be their goals? What is the best possible reaction strategy? If the decision was to change our price, what nonprice measures were discussed? What competitive counterreaction do we expect? What situation will we be in after competitors react?

The Porsche case here is a deep dive into two highly successful products that enabled the firm to break out of its sports car niche: the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle and the Panamera sedan.

All of these are great features, but no matter how amazing Uber's app may be, no matter how clean the vehicles or magical the customer experience, none of that counts when a would-be rider sees the dreaded words, no cars available. According to Bill Gurley, an early investor and current Uber board member, that was one of the company's biggest challenges.

- Even among the all-star team of Uber insiders, Gurley stands apart. On Forbes’ Midas List, dubbed “The World's Smartest Tech Investors,” Gurley has also served on the boards of GrubHub, Zillow, NextDoor, and OpenTable among several others. His blog, Above the Crowd, is a must-read for the growth capital community. And before he became famous, he was the lead analyst for the IPO of a little-known company at that time, Amazon. Early on, according to Gurley, Uber had discovered that they were dealing with a highly price-sensitive crowd. “It became very obvious very early in the company that the elasticity was off the charts,” Gurley says in a conversation he had with us.8 The key insight was that this did not just apply to the riders. It applied to the drivers as well. Faced with a shortage of drivers to pick up weekend bar patrons just after last call, Uber “messed around with incentives,” says Gurley. The results were surprisingly strong. By offering additional money, they were able to “move supply off the edge” and get more drivers picking up Bostonians at 2 a.m. The company could have attacked the car availability problem by forcing drivers to sign up for quotas, as some firms do. They could have insisted on regular hours, graveyard shifts, and forced scheduling. Instead, ([Location 3811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=3811))

- they solved it in the most elegant way possible: with a monetization model. This is what Gurley refers to as the “dynamic piece,” also known as Uber's surge pricing. Today, in times of peak demand, the company charges customers more for a ride than during non-peak times. In Chapter 7, we discussed this approach under the name “dynamic pricing,” one of the key monetization models powering many successful businesses. In effect, Uber's platform has a customer pay the driver more during high-demand periods, so that the driver is willing to brave the elements—or skip their own New Year's Eve party—to give the customer a ride. If Uber had not implemented the dynamic pricing model, the alternative would have been to leave numerous customers in the lurch, complaining about availability and reliability. Such customer dissatisfaction would have severely hurt adoption. Instead, the dynamic model intentionally reduces demand and at the same time increases supply in order to maximize availability and reliability. This model creates a platform where supply is controlled not by the company but by the independent contractors. And it works brilliantly. “I still find it the most fascinating piece of Uber, because we do no scheduling whatsoever,” ([Location 3823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=3823))

- In Chapter 10, we described how value communication can sometimes be the most difficult task of all. This was one area where even Uber stumbled, discovering just how hard it was to communicate that dynamic pricing was actually good for the customer. Many companies use dynamic pricing to charge more during peak periods. Think of a resort in the summer months or a stadium-adjacent parking lot on game day. This is usually done to boost profits. But as discussed previously, Uber's goal was ensuring 24/7 availability of cars, come rain, sleet, or snow. Rather than pocketing the surcharge, Uber passes most of it on to their drivers. Unfortunately, the term surge pricing does not communicate the value Uber brings to the rider, who otherwise might have been stranded: As Gurley points out, Uber's peak pricing typically occurs when every form of transportation is… ([Location 3836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=3836))

- To the Optimizely monetization team, the question of how to charge was, in many ways, more important than how much to charge. The more a customer uses the product, the more benefits the customer derives. Consequently, the team wanted to base the monetization model on usage. Use it more, pay more for it. But that model would be a bit unusual in the software industry (at least back in 2010). When the team looked at the software market, it found most SaaS companies priced their offerings on a per-user basis. Per-user pricing made sense, they believed, if customers got more value as more of their employees used the software—a network ([Location 4083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01F4DYY1I&location=4083))

The number of employees in a company using Optimizely's service had no bearing on whether that company generated business value from the software. If Optimizely had charged on a SaaS per-user model, and only the few employees who worked on it were monetized, Optimizely would have left a lot of money on the table. They would have produced a classic minivation. In addition, the monetization team also worried that customers would not be able to predict how many people would use the software. This would likely slow down the purchase decision. After weighing these factors, the monetization team decided to charge according to the number of monthly unique visitors (MUVs) bucketed into an experiment. This metric was more in line with the value of Optimizely's product. It also enabled smaller companies with lower site traffic to afford Optimizely. As their use of the software grew, they would get more value from it and thus be in a better position to pay more as their website traffic grew. That's a win-win. Larger companies tended to have larger MUVs and already were in a good position to pay Optimizely a price commensurate with the value they gained from the product.

- The MUVs model also enabled Optimizely to increase revenue from customers over time. The more tests a customer conducted, the more value it received from Optimizely, and the more it would pay in return for getting greater value. In addition, as a customer's web traffic grew, it had to spend more to maintain the same level of testing. The MUVs pricing model also simplified Optimizely's sales process, since customers only needed to know their monthly site traffic (not how many users might use the software)—a measure they invariably knew. (If they didn't, it was doubtful Optimizely could help them. After all, it was software, not a magic wand.) The MUVs pricing model is exactly analogous to the Michelin monetization model described in Chapter 7: charging by the miles truckers drove the tires, not per tire.

- The moral of the Optimizely story is that there is no one right answer for monetizing a suite of products. Had Optimizely kept its monetization model the same for the two products, it might have created a suboptimal outcome. By designing each product separately around the value and the price, Optimizely and its products have been a huge market success. With 400 employees, the firm has continued to grow rapidly. It expanded its headquarters in San Francisco and opened five others in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Looking ahead, Optimizely has positioned its products as a website customer experience optimization platform, on which the company will add future Optimizely products. But before it launches those new products, the firm won't have to guess how many customers will want them and how much they'll pay. You can bet it will know.

- That's what this chapter is about: implementing the nine rules of monetizing innovation in your organization. We explain what you need to do, whether you're a billion-dollar company or a start-up and whether you sell products or services to consumers or to other businesses. We provide the steps; you'll need to customize them to fit the realities of your organization. (As we've shown, in this world there is no such thing as one size fits all.) The implementation has two phases: “Jump-Start and Pilot” and “Scale and Stick.” Jump-Start and Pilot will help answer the question “What can we start doing tomorrow?” In Scale and Stick, we explain the processes, governance, tools, change management measures, and training you'll need to implement the new process to monetize innovation, and how to make it stick. After that, we answer the question “What barriers should we expect to face?” We describe the pitfalls you must avoid because, again, this is a transformation.
