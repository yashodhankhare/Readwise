- I must confess that writing this book was difficult. It required delving deeply into several disciplines and then distilling the essence of each into one short chapter. The discussions are, of necessity and without undue apology, both brief and general. If you happen to be an expert in any one of these disciplines, you may quibble with my presentation or may conclude I have omitted certain concepts. However, I hope you appreciate that to do otherwise would have resulted in a book with chapters one hundred pages long and a final manuscript equal in proportion to an encyclopedia. While writing this book, I came to believe it was far more important to deliver an abbreviated sermon to a larger number of people than to restrict its overall message to the few who would be willing to tackle a dissertation. For this reason, I hope you will recognize it was necessary to limit the descriptions in each discipline to the very basics.

- Mistakes in investing most often occur because of investor confusion. In my opinion, the basic investment lessons we have learned thus far have not given us a complete view of how markets work or how investors operate within markets. No wonder we’re confused. No wonder we make mistakes. When we don’t understand something, there is always a fifty-fifty chance we will make the wrong decision. If this book improves, even slightly, your understanding of investing and how markets work, then the odds of success will tilt in your favor.

- Charlie’s attention to other disciplines is purposeful. He operates in the firm belief that uniting the mental models from separate disciplines to create a latticework of understanding is a powerful way to achieve superior investment results. Investment decisions are more likely to be correct when ideas from other disciplines lead to the same conclusions. That is the topmost payoff—broader understanding makes us better investors. It will be immediately obvious, however, that the ramifications are much wider. Those who strive to understand connections are well on the way to worldly wisdom. This makes us not only better investors but better leaders, better citizens, better parents, spouses, and friends.

- Beeman continues: “Benjamin Franklin’s success as an educator was based upon three standing principles. First the student must acquire the basic skill sets: reading, writing, arithmetic, physical education, and public speaking. Then the student was introduced to the bodies of knowledge, and finally the student was taught to cultivate habits of mind by discovering the connections that exist between the bodies of knowledge.” In the 250 years since Franklin’s proposal, American educators have continued to debate the best method to train young minds, and college administrators have continued to adjust their curricula in the hope of attracting the best students. Critics of our current education system remain, and many of their criticisms seem valid; yet for all its faults, our education system today has done a reasonably good job of providing skills and producing knowledge—the first two of Franklin’s key principles. What is often lacking is his third principle: the “habits of mind” that seek to link together different bodies of knowledge. We can change this. Even if our days of formal schooling are behind us, we can search on our own for the linkages between ideas in various arenas, the connections that illuminate real understanding. It is of course easy to see that cultivating Franklin’s “habits of mind,” to use Professor Beeman’s wonderful phrase, is the key to achieving Charlie Munger’s “worldly wisdom.” But seeing this is one thing; acting on it is another. For many of us, this goes against the mental grain. After having invested many years in learning one specialty, we are now being asked to teach ourselves others. We are told not to be bound by narrow confines of the discipline we were trained in, but to leap over the intellectual fences and look at what’s on the other side. For investors, the rewards for making the effort are enormous. When you allow yourself to look beyond the immediate fences, you are able to observe similarities in other fields and recognize patterns of ideas. Then, as one concept is reinforced by another and another and then another, you know you are on the right track. The key is finding the linkages that connect one idea to another. Fortunately for us, the human mind already works this way. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=196))

- In this view, learning new concepts has less to do with a change in a person’s learning ability than with the existence of commonalties. We do not learn new subjects because we have somehow become better learners but because we have become better at recognizing patterns. Edward Thorndike’s theory of learning lies at the core of a contemporary theory in cognitive science called connectionism. (The cognitive sciences encompass how the brain works—how we think, learn, reason, remember, and make decisions.) Connectionism, building from Thorndike’s studies of stimulus-response patterns, holds that learning is a process of trial and error in which favorable responses to new situations (stimuli) actually alter the neural connections between brain cells. That is, the process of learning affects the synaptic connections between neurons, which are continually adjusting as they recognize familiar patterns and accommodate new information. The brain has the ability to link together related connections into a chain and to transfer what was learned to similar situations; intelligence, therefore, can be viewed as a function of how many connections a person has learned. Connectionism has received a great deal of attention from business leaders as well as scientists because it is at the heart of a powerful new system of information technology known as artificial neural networks. These neural networks, as they are more commonly called, attempt to replicate the workings of the brain more closely than has been possible with traditional computers. In the brain, neurons function within groups called networks, each with thousands of interconnected neurons. We can therefore think of the brain as a collection of neural networks. Artificial neural networks, in turn, are computers that mimic the basic structure of the brain: they consist of hundreds of processing units (analogous to neurons) that are cross connected into a complex network. (Surprisingly, neurons are several orders of magnitude slower than silicon chips, but the brain makes up for this lack of speed by having a massive number of connections that afford enormous efficiencies.) The great power of the neural network, and the quality that sets it apart from a traditional computer, is that the weighting of the connections between its units can be adjusted, just as the brain’s synapses adjust, becoming weaker or stronger or even rewired altogether as needed to perform different tasks. So, just like the brain, a neural network can learn. Just like the brain, it has the ability to recognize complex patterns, classify new information into patterns, and draw associations between the new data.

- We are only beginning to understand how this technology can be applied in the business world. A few examples: A manufacturer of baby foods uses the technology to manage trading cattle futures. Soft drink bottlers use it as an “electronic nose” to catch and analyze unpleasant odors. Credit card companies use it to detect forged signatures and to spot fraud by identifying deviations in spending habits. Airlines use it to forecast flight demand. Postal services use neural networks to decipher sloppy handwriting, and computer companies use them to develop software that will recognize handwritten notes sent via email and engineering schematics sketched on a cocktail napkin.

- According to Holland, innovative thinking requires us to master two important steps. First, we must understand the basic disciplines from which we are going to draw knowledge; second, we need to be aware of the use and benefit of metaphors.

- Innovative thinking, which is our goal, most often occurs when two or more mental models act in combination. A latticework of mental models is itself a metaphor. And on the surface, quite a simple one at that. Everyone knows what latticework is, and most people have some degree of firsthand experience with it. There is probably not a do-it-yourselfer who hasn’t made good use of a four-by-eight sheet of latticework at some point. We use it to decorate fences, to create shade over patios, and to support climbing plants. It is but a very small stretch to envision a metaphorical lattice as the support structure for organizing a set of mental concepts.

- Two years after Charlie Munger startled the finance students at USC by challenging them to consider investing as a subdivision of worldly wisdom, he reprised his notion of a latticework of models at Stanford Law School, this time in some more detail.5 He first reiterated his basic theme: true learning and lasting success come to those who make the effort to first build a latticework of mental models and then learn to think in an associative, multidisciplinary manner. It may take some work, he warned, especially if your education has forced you to specialize. But once those models are firmly set in your mind, you are intellectually equipped to deal with many different kinds of situations. “You can reach out and grasp the model that better solves the overall problem. All you have to do is know it and develop the right mental habits.” No doubt Benjamin Franklin would approve. I believe extraordinary rewards are possible for those who are willing to undertake the discovery of combinations between mental models. When that happens, what Charlie calls “especially big forces” take over. This is more than one plus one; it’s the explosive power of critical mass, what Charlie—the master of colorful language—calls “the lollapalooza effect.” This is the heart of the investing philosophy that is presented in this book: developing the ability to think of finance and investing as one piece of a unified whole, one segment of a body of knowledge. Done right, it produces nothing short of a lollapalooza effect. I believe it is our best hope for long-term investment success. Let’s give Charlie the final word on the subject. In response to questions from Stanford students concerned about the process of uncovering the models, he remarked: “Worldly wisdom is mostly very, very simple. There are a relatively small number of disciplines and a relatively small number of truly big ideas. And it’s a lot of fun to figure out. Even better, the fun never stops. Furthermore, there’s a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience.” “What I am urging on you is not that hard to do. And the rewards are awesome…. It’ll help you in business. It’ll help you in law. It’ll help you in life. And it’ll help you in love…. It makes you better able to serve others, it makes you better able to serve yourself, and it makes life more fun.” ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=318))

- The lesson Newton took from Kepler is one that has been repeated many times throughout history: Our ability to answer even the most fundamental aspects of human existence depends largely upon measuring instruments available at the time and the ability of scientists to apply rigorous mathematical reasoning to the data. The second influence on Newton’s thinking was the work of Galileo Galilei, who died the year Newton was born. Galileo, the Italian philosopher, mathematician, inventor, and physicist, is considered to be the first modern-day experimental scientist. Among his many inventions are the thermometer, the pendulum clock, the proportional compass used by draftsmen, and—most important to our story—the telescope. Galileo was thus the first to actually observe the heavenly bodies described by all the earlier astronomers: Kepler, Copernicus, Ptolemy, and Aristotle. With the technology of the magnifying optical instrument, Galileo could prove once and for all that the earth was not the center of the universe. Galileo promoted a mathematical view of science. He believed that numerical relationships could be discovered throughout nature but hastened to add that their existence was not contradictory to the teachings of the church. It was important, he felt, to distinguish between “God’s word” and “God’s work.” According to Galileo, primacy was in God’s work, and it was the goal of scientists to discover the relationships in nature on the basis of logic. Today, he is best remembered among scientists for his experimental techniques. The third important influence on Newton was Rene Descartes, the French mathematician and scientist who is often called the father of modern philosophy. He was one of the first to oppose the Aristotelian view of the world and instead embrace an empirical and mechanistic approach. Descartes died in 1650, eight years after Newton was born, and his ideas were gaining acceptance in certain circles by the time Newton entered Cambridge. Descartes promoted a mechanical view of the world. He argued that the only way to understand how something works is to build a mechanical model of it, even if that model is constructed only in our imagination. According to Descartes, the human body, a falling rock, a growing tree, or a stormy night all suggested that mechanical laws were at work. This mechanical view provided a powerful research program for seventeenth-century scientists. It suggested that no matter how complex or difficult the observation, it was possible to discover the underlying mechanical laws to explain the phenomenon. In his first days at Cambridge, Newton was unaware of the new discoveries and theories of these three scientists. But with relentless study and by applying his own intense powers of concentration, Newton quickly grasped their basic ideas. What he did with those ideas is the crux of our story. While still a student, Newton began to synthesize Kepler’s celestial laws of planetary motion with Galileo’s… ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=380))

- of gravity pulling them toward the sun. Thus, two equal forces create a state of equilibrium.1 Equilibrium is defined as a state of balance between opposing forces, powers, or influences. An equilibrium model typically identifies a system that is at rest; this is called static equilibrium. When competing forces are equally matched, a system reaches dynamic equilibrium. A scale that is equally weighted on both sides is an example of static equilibrium. Fill a bathtub full of water and then turn off the faucet and you will observe static equilibrium. But if you unplug the drain and then turn on the faucet so the level of the bathtub does not change, you are witnessing dynamic equilibrium. Another example is the human body. It remains in dynamic equilibrium so long as the heat loss from cooling remains in balance with the consumption of sugars. With the publication of Principia, scientists quickly embraced the belief that the entire natural world was governed by universal laws rather than by a godhead whose will no human could ever know. It is impossible to overstate the significance of the shift. It represents nothing less than a complete reversal of the very foundation on which human existence was thought to rest. It meant that scientists no longer relied on divine revelation for understanding. If they could discern natural laws of the universe, they would be able to predict the future based on the present data. The scientific process used to investigate those natural laws is the legacy of Sir Isaac Newton. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=421))

- After Newton, scholars in many fields focused their attention on systems that demonstrate equilibrium (whether static or dynamic), believing that it is nature’s ultimate goal. If any deviations in the forces occurred, it was assumed that the deviations were small and temporary—and the system would always revert back to equilibrium. The critical point to our story is how the concept of equilibrium expanded from celestial mechanics into much broader applications, particularly economics. For more than two hundred years, economists have relied on equilibrium theory to explain the behavior of economies. Alfred Marshall, the British economist, was the chief proponent of the concept of dynamic equilibrium in economics. His celebrated text, Principles of Economics, originally published in 1890, is considered one of the most important contributions to economics literature.2 In Book 5 of Principles of Economics, which addresses the relationship of demand, supply, and price, Marshall devotes three separate chapters to economic equilibrium: in individuals, in companies, and in the marketplace. In regard to individuals, Marshall explains: The simplest case of balance or equilibrium between desire and effort is found when a person satisfies one of his wants by his own direct work. When a boy picks blue-berries for his own eating, the action of picking is probably itself pleasurable for a while; and for sometime longer the pleasure of eating is more than enough to repay the trouble of picking. But after he has eaten a good deal, the desire for eating diminishes; while the task of picking begins to cause weakness, which may indeed be a feeling of monotony rather than fatigue. Equilibrium is reached when at last his eagerness to play and his disinclination for the work of picking counterbalance the desire for eating.3 ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=446))

- and at the turning point there is a balance or equilibrium of forces of life and decay.”4 Even in the marketplace, the forces of equilibrium work to maintain a balance between demand and supply and help set prices for goods. According to Marshall, “When the demand price is equal to the supply price, the amount produced has no tendency either to be increased or to be diminished; it is in equilibrium.”5 In Marshall’s opinion, when the economy reaches equilibrium, it achieves stability. In fact, Marshall believed that equilibrium is the natural state of the economy; if the prices, demand, or supply become displaced, the economy will work to return to its natural equilibrium state. Here is his eloquent argument: ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=465))

- An important part of our story is tracing how Samuelson, with his respect for evidence and scientific methods, developed his own theories of how the market establishes prices. And, in yet another demonstration of the cumulative nature of human knowledge, we learn that Samuelson’s attitude about the market was shaped by the works of Louis Bachelier, Maurice Kendall, and Alfred Cowles. In 1932, Alfred Cowles established the Cowles Commission for Research and Economics. Having subscribed to several investment services, none of which predicted the 1929 stock market crash, Cowles set about to determine whether market forecasters could actually predict the future direction of the market. In one of the most detailed studies ever conducted, the commission analyzed 6,904 forecasts from 1929 through 1944; according to Cowles, “the results failed to disclose evidence of ability to predict successfully the future course of the stock market.”8 Maurice Kendall, a professor of statistics at the London School of Economics, looked past the market forecasters the Cowles Commission studied and instead analyzed individual stock prices. In a 1953 paper entitled “The Analysis of Economic Time Series,” Kendall studied the behavior of stock prices dating back over fifty years and was unable to find any patterns for structure in prices that would lead someone to make an accurate forecast. According to Peter Bernstein, whose Capital Ideas explores the origins of modern financial theory, Samuelson’s interest in the stock market was triggered in large part by the news that Kendall’s paper was greeted enthusiastically at the Royal Statistical Society. In thinking about Kendall’s work, Samuelson connected the idea of stock price movements with the classical economic theory of price and value. For nearly two hundred years, since the 1776 publication of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, economists had agreed there is a fundamental value, the “true value,” that underlies the marketplace, and prices tend to bounce above and below this value. Of course, what has haunted economists and investors alike ever since is the debate over what is the true value. Alfred Marshall tells us competition ultimately determines equilibrium price. If price is oscillating, it is because there is a temporary imbalance between supply and demand, but this is ultimately corrected by the marketplace. For his part, Samuelson believed stock prices bounced around because of the perceived uncertainty over a stock’s future value. Whether IBM is worth a hundred dollars per share or fifty dollars per share is a debate in the marketplace over the future growth of its earnings, the competitive landscape, and attitudes about inflation and interest rates. In his 1965 landmark paper, “Proof That Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly,” Samuelson introduced the concept of “shadow prices”—a stock’s intrinsic, but perhaps not obvious, value. Of course, the problem is how to bring shadow prices to the… ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=489))

- One place where the question is being raised is the Santa Fe Institute, where scientists from several disciplines are studying complex adaptive systems—those systems with many interacting parts that are continually changing their behavior in response to changes in the environment. A simple system, in contrast, has very few interacting parts. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the central nervous system, ecologies, ant colonies, political systems, social structures, and economies. To this list of complex adaptive systems we must add one more: stock markets. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=558))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Every complex adaptive system is actually a network of many individual agents all acting in parallel and interacting with one another. The critical variable that makes a system both complex and adaptive is the idea that agents (neurons, ants, or investors) in the system accumulate experience by interacting with other agents and then change themselves to adapt to a changing environment. No thoughtful person, looking at the present stock market, can fail to conclude that it shows all the traits of a complex adaptive system. And this takes us to the crux of the matter. If a complex adaptive system is, by definition, continuously adapting, it is impossible for any such system, including the stock market, ever to reach a state of perfect equilibrium. What does that mean for the market? It throws the classic theories of economic equilibrium into serious question.12 The standard equilibrium theory is rational, mechanistic, and efficient. It assumes that identical individual investors share rational expectations about stock prices and then efficiently discount that information into the market. It further assumes there are no profitable strategies available that are not already priced into the market. The counterview from Santa Fe suggests the opposite: a market that is not rational, is organic rather than ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=563))

- mechanistic, and is imperfectly efficient. It assumes the individual agents are, in fact, irrational and hence will misprice securities, creating the possibility for profitable strategies. In later chapters we will consider the underlying psychology that causes people to behave irrationally where money is concerned.

- In all fairness, I must point out that classical economists and proponents of modern portfolio theory recognize that their systems are not capable of perfect equilibrium. Near the end of his life, even Alfred Marshall went public with his misgivings. Paul Samuelson acknowledged that people do not begin with perfect rationality but believed that over time the rational and thoughtful investor will win out over the irrational and visceral. Likewise, Fama believes that an efficient market requires neither total rationality nor perfect information; however, because it is efficient, he says, it is all but impossible for any one individual to beat the market.

- In an environment of complexity, simple laws are insufficient to explain the entire system. Equilibrium may indeed be the natural state of the world, and restoring it when it is disturbed may be nature’s goal, but it is not the constant condition that Newtonian physics would suggest. At any given moment, both equilibrium and disequilibrium may be found in the market. It’s a bit like those trick photographs that show two different scenes; one well-known example seems at first to depict a wineglass, until you shift your perspective and see that it also portrays a silhouette of a woman in an old-fashioned dress. Both images are correct; both exist simultaneously. Which one we focus on is a matter of personal perspective. In much the same way, the balance between supply and demand, between price and value, will always be in evidence in the daily operation of the market, but it no longer gives us the full answer. Just as our viewpoint of the world changed when it was demonstrated the earth was no longer the center of the universe, so will your viewpoint of the market change, I believe, when we accept that it is not governed strictly by the mechanical laws of Newton. The obvious question then becomes, if the Newtonian perspective is inadequate by itself, what other mental models should we add? The answer, described in the following chapter, may surprise you.

- Turning to biology for insight into finance and investing may at first seem a startling move, but just as we did in our study of physics, we focus here on just one core idea from the field of biology: evolution. Whereas in nature the process of evolution is one of natural selection, seeing the market within an evolutionary framework allows us to observe the law of economic selection.

- The originality of Darwin’s theory lay in the idea that the struggle for survival was occurring not only between species but between individuals within the same species. If having a longer beak, for example, increased a bird’s chances of survival, then more birds with long beaks would be more likely to pass this advantage on. Eventually, the longer beak would become dominant within the species.3 By this process of natural selection, Darwin theorized, favorable variations are preserved and transmitted to succeeding generations. After several generations, small gradual changes in the species begin to add up to larger changes—thus, evolution occurs.

So with this homage, Marshall is hinting that he aligns himself with the intellectual revolution triggered by Darwin’s work and perhaps also that he sees virtue in viewing economics through a Darwinian prism. His real intention is a tantalizing puzzle for us today, for Marshall was never fully explicit about his position.

- According to Kuhn, when an observed phenomenon is not adequately explained by the dominant paradigm, a new competing paradigm is born. Scientists left with an ineffectual model go to work on developing a new theoretical outline.

- Unshackling themselves from the classical teachings, the Santa Fe group was able to point out four distinct features they observed about the economy.       1.  Dispersed interaction: What happens in the economy is determined by the interactions of a great number of individual agents all acting in parallel. The action of any one individual agent depends on the anticipated actions of a limited number of agents as well as on the system they cocreate. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=827))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 2.  No global controller: Although there are laws and institutions, there is no one global entity that controls the economy. Rather, the system is controlled by the competition and coordination between agents of the system.       3.  Continual adaptation: The behavior, actions, and strategies of the agents, as well as their products and services, are revised continually on the basis of accumulated experience. In other words, the system adapts. It creates new products, new markets, new institutions, and new behavior. It is an ongoing system.       4.  Out-of-equilibrium dynamics: Unlike the equilibrium models that dominate the thinking in classical economics, the Santa Fe group believed the economy, because of constant change, operates far from equilibrium. An essential element of complex adaptive systems is a feedback loop. That is, agents in the system first form expectations or models and then act on the basis of predictions generated by these models. But over time these models change depending on how accurately they predict the environment. If the model is useful, it is retained; if not, the agents alter the model to increase its predictability. Obviously, accuracy of predictability is a paramount concern to participants in the stock market, and we may be able to achieve broader understanding if we can learn to view the market as one type of complex adaptive system. The whole notion of complex systems is a new way of seeing the world, and it is not easily grasped. How exactly do agents in complex adaptive systems interact? How do they go about collectively creating, and then changing, a model for predicting the future? For those of us who are not scientists, finding a way to visualize the process is helpful. Brian Arthur gives us an answer with an example he dubbed “the El Farol Problem.” El Farol, a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, used to feature Irish music on Thursday nights. Arthur, the Irishman, loved to go there. On most occasions, the bar patrons were well behaved, and it was enjoyable to sit and listen to the music. But on some nights, the bar was packed with so many people crammed together drinking and singing that the scene became unruly. Now Arthur was confronted with a problem: How could he decide which nights to go to El Farol and which nights to stay home? The chore of having to decide led him to formulate a mathematical theory he named the El Farol Problem. It has, he says, all the characteristics of a complex adaptive system. Suppose, says Arthur, there are one hundred people in Santa Fe who are interested in going to El Farol to listen to Irish music, but none of them wants to go if the bar is going to be crowded. Now also suppose the bar published its weekly attendance for the past ten weeks. With this information, the music lovers will build models to predict how many people will show up next Thursday. Some may figure that it will be approximately the same number of people as last week. Others will take an average of the last… ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=832))

- In a Santa Fe Institute paper titled “Market Force, Ecology, and Evolution,” Farmer has taken the important first step in outlining the behavior of the stock market in biological terms. His analogy between a biological ecology of interacting species and a financial ecology of interacting strategies is summarized in the table shown here.14 Farmer is the first to admit the analogy is not perfect, but it does present a stimulating way in which to think about the market. Furthermore, it links the process to clearly defined science of how living systems behave and evolve. If we go back through the history of the stock market and seek to identify the trading strategies that dominated the landscape, I believe there have been five major strategies, (which in Farmer’s analogy would be species). 1.  In the 1930s and 1940s, the discount-to-hard-book value strategy, first proposed by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their classic 1934 textbook Security Analysis, was dominant. 2.  After World War II the second major strategy that dominated finance was the dividend model. As the memories of the 1929 market crash faded and prosperity returned, investors were increasingly attracted to stocks that paid high dividends, and lower-paying bonds lost favor. So popular was the dividend strategy that by the 1950s, the yield on dividend-paying stocks dropped below the yield of bonds—a historical first. 3.  By the 1960s, a third strategy appeared. Investors exchanged stocks paying high dividends for companies that were expected to grow their earnings at a high rate.

- 4.  By the 1980s, a fourth strategy took over. Warren Buffett stressed the need to focus on companies with high “owner-earnings” or cash flows. 5.  Today we can see that cash return on invested capital is emerging as the fifth new strategy.

- Most of us easily recognize these well-known strategies, and we can readily accept the idea that each one gained favor by overtaking a previously dominant strategy and was then itself eventually overtaken by a new strategy. In a word, evolution took place in the stock market via economic selection. How does economic selection occur? Remember that in Farmer’s analogy, a biological population is capital and natural selection occurs by capital allocation. This means capital varies in relation to the popularity of the strategy. If a strategy is successful, it attracts more capital and becomes the dominant strategy. When a new strategy that works is discovered, capital is reallocated—or, in biological terms, there is a change in population. As Farmer notes, “The… ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=917))

- Why are financial strategies so diverse? The answer, Farmer believes, starts with the idea that basic strategies induce patterns of behavior. Agents rush in to exploit these obvious patterns, causing an ultimate side effect. As more agents begin using the same strategy, its profitability drops. The inefficiency becomes apparent, and the original strategy is washed out. But then new agents enter the picture with new ideas. They form new strategies of which any number may become profitable. Capital shifts and the new strategy explodes, which starts the evolutionary process again. It is the classic El Farol Problem described by Brian Arthur. Will the market ever become efficient? If you accept the idea that evolution plays a role in financial markets the answer would have to be no. Each strategy that eliminates an inefficiency will soon be replaced in turn by a new strategy. The market will always maintain some level of diversity, and this we know is a principal cause of evolution. What we are learning is that studying economic and financial systems is very similar to studying biological systems.

- It is tempting, therefore, to rush full steam ahead toward a biological interpretation of the economy and the stock market. We can identify more analogies with biological systems than with physical systems. But we must guard our enthusiasm. This approach is still unfolding, and there are several missing pieces. One of them, according to Farmer, concerns the question of speed: innovation in financial markets is rapid, compared to the slow, random-variation process in biological systems. Because of this, Farmer believes the timeline for market efficiency may still be decades away. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=973))

- There are some who are dismayed that evolutionary biology cannot make firm predictions. But Darwin never claimed that ability. The Darwinian revolution is very much about how change replaced stasis and, in doing so, gave us a more accurate picture of the behavior of all living things. In her book The Nature of Economies, Jane Jacobs captures the essence perfectly: “A living system makes itself up as it goes along.”18 For that reason alone, I believe that biological systems (stock markets included), unlike physical systems, will never possess a stable mean.

- The German philosopher Immanuel Kant once said there would “never be a Newton of the grass blades.” He was wrong. The intellectual revolution caused by Darwin’s theory of natural selection is every bit as powerful as Newton’s gravitational force. Indeed, the movement from the mechanical view of the world to the biological view of the world has been called the “second scientific revolution.” After three hundred years, the Newtonian world, the mechanized world operating in perfect equilibrium, is now the old science. The old science is about a universe of individual parts, rigid laws, and simple forces. The systems are linear: Change is proportional to the inputs. Small changes end in small results, and large changes make for large results. In the old science, the systems are predictable. The new science is connected and entangled. In the new science, the system is nonlinear and unpredictable, with sudden and abrupt changes. Small changes can have large effects while large events may result in small changes. In nonlinear systems, the individual parts interact and exhibit feedback effects that may alter behavior. Complex adaptive systems must be studied as a whole, not in individual parts, because the behavior of the system is greater than the sum of the parts. The old science was concerned with understanding the laws of being. The new science is concerned with the laws of becoming. How ironic it is that biologists, once thought to be the stepchildren of science, are now leading us away from the old science into the new. It seems fair to give Charles Darwin the last word. He was a gifted writer whose scientific observations have become literary masterpieces. One of his best-known passages is the last paragraph in The Origin of Species, and it serves as a fitting end to this chapter.

- It’s unfortunate that Charles Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of the Crowds was not available for Newton. But that masterpiece on crowd psychology was not to be written for another 120 years. Still, Newton could have studied Joseph de la Vega, a successful Jewish merchant and philanthropist who had written the first book on the stock market titled Confusion of Confusions ([1688] 1996). In it, Vega presents the art of speculation as a dialogue between different market participants. It was a brilliant narrative tool, which helped the reader better understand speculation and trading. Vega’s Confusion of Confusions is easily summarized. In the Second Dialogue, Vega lists four basic principles of trading—as relevant today as they were 325 years ago: ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1026))

- The first principle: Never advise anyone to buy or sell shares. Where perspicacity is weakened, the most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly. The second principle: Take every gain without showing remorse about missed profits. It is wise to enjoy what is possible without hoping for the continuance of a favorable conjuncture and the persistence of good luck. The third principle: Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins. At one time they may be carbuncle stones, then coals, then diamonds, then flint-stones, then morning dew, then tears. The fourth principle: Whoever wishes to win in this game must have patience and money, since values are so little constant and the rumors so little founded on truth.

- Granted, this is a complicated perspective from which to investigate humankind. But man is a complex being, and those who would understand human behavior must find a way to work within the complexity. Fortunately, guidance is at hand in the scientific area of inquiry known as complexity theory. In earlier chapters, we have identified economies and stock markets as complex systems. The term complexity is derived etymologically from the Latin word plexus, which means interwoven. When we think about complexity we intuitively understand the difficulty of separating the individual from the whole. Furthermore, separating individuals in order to study them singularly negates the observation, for we know individual behavior is highly influenced by its interactions with other individuals in the collective. We have come to understand that economies and stock markets are adaptive systems. As such, their behavior constantly changes as individuals in the system interact with other individuals and within the system itself. Many social scientists now start with the same assumption. They recognize that human systems, whether economic, political, or social, are complex systems. Furthermore, sociologists now recognize that a universal trait of all social systems is their adaptability. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1116))

- Self-organized systems, explains Johnson, have three distinct characteristics. First, the complex global behavior occurs by simple connected local processors. In a social system, the local processors are individuals. Second, a solution arises from the diversity of the individual inputs. Third, the functionality of the system, its robustness, is far greater than any one of the individual processors. Johnson believes that the symbiotic combination of humans and networks (Internet) will generate, in a collective, far better results that any one individual can do acting alone. He envisions an “unprecedented capability in organizational and societal problem solving will result from increased human activity on smart distributed information systems.”2 One of the great advantages of the Internet is how it helps us manage information; in this, explains Johnson, the Internet has three significant advantages over prior systems. First, it is able to integrate a wide breadth of knowledge compared to other systems whose information was often physically separated. Second, the Internet is able to capture and display depth of information. With digitization, systems are able to produce volumes of data on a single topic without significant additional cost. Third, the Internet is able to process information correctly. As we will learn in the next chapter on psychology, communication missteps between individuals sometimes result in the loss of vital information. Information exchanged via the Internet is delivered accurately, in much the same way that books and documents are able to transmit information. It is Johnson’s belief that these three advantages, along with the interconnectivity of millions of individuals, will greatly enhance the collective problem-solving ability of self-organized systems. To illustrate the phenomenon of emergence, let’s look in on a familiar social system: an ant colony. Because ants are social insects (they live in colonies, and their behavior is directed to the survival of the colony rather than the survival of any one individual ant), social scientists have long been fascinated by their decision-making process. One of the ant’s most interesting behaviors is the process of foraging for food and then determining the shortest path between the food source and the nest.3 While walking between the two, ants lay down a pheromone trail that allows them to trace the path and also show other ants the location of the new food source. At the beginning, the search for food is a random process, with ants starting out in many different directions. Once they locate food, they return to the nest, laying down the pheromone trail as they go. But now comes the very sophisticated aspect to collective problem solving: the colony, acting as a whole, is able to select the shortest path. If one ant randomly finds a shorter path between the food source and the nest, its quicker return to the nest intensifies the concentration of pheromone along the path. Other… ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1191))

- To put this in perspective, Johnson’s research suggests that the stock market, theoretically, is more robust when it is composed of a diverse group of agents—some of average intelligence, some of below-average intelligence, and some very smart—than a market singularly composed of smart agents. At first, this discovery appears counterintuitive. Today, we are quick to blame the amateur behavior of uninformed individual investors and day traders for the volatile nature of the market. But if Johnson is correct, the diverse participation of all investors, traders and speculators—smart and dumb alike—should make the markets stronger, not weaker. Another important insight from Norman Johnson was his discovery that the system, as long as it is adequately diverse, is relatively insensitive to moderate amounts of noise (by which he means any sort of discordant, disruptive activity). To prove the point, Johnson intentionally degraded an individual contribution; he learned his action had no effect on participants’ finding the shortest path out of the maze. Even at the highest levels of disruption, the collective behavior, after a brief postponement, was able to discover the minimal path. Not until the system reached its highest noise level did the collective decision-making process break down. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1234))

- The work of Norman Johnson appears to contradict the classical views of crowd behavior. From Henry David Thoreau to Thomas Carlyle to Friedrich Nietzsche, the nineteenth century’s great intellectuals were highly suspicious of collective judgment. It was Thoreau who said “as a member of a crowd, he at once becomes a blockhead.” Nietzsche tells us “the mass never comes up to the standard of its best member,” and Carlyle wrote, “I do not believe in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.”5 But no one was a more vocal critic of the intellect of crowds than Gustave Le Bon. A French sociologist and psychologist, Le Bon spent his career studying herding behavior and crowd psychology. The culmination of his work was published in 1895 under the title La psychologie des foules (The Psychology of Crowds); the English version was titled The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind. On first reading, it appears Le Bon has foreseen Norman Johnson. He writes that the crowd is an independent organism greater than the sum of its parts. It has the ability to operate independently and as such forms its own identity and will. But whereas Johnson tells us the emergent property of the crowd is superior reasoning, Le Bon reached the opposite conclusion. Like Thoreau, Carlyle, Nietzsche, and Mackay, Le Bon believed that crowds “can never accomplish acts demanding a high degree of intelligence” and “they are always intellectually inferior to the isolated individual.”6 Who is right? The answer lies in an outstanding book titled, The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies, and Nations. Written by James Surowiecki, the business columnist for The New Yorker, it purposefully takes aim at Mackay’s idea of “the madness of crowds” with a simple, powerful thesis: “under the right circumstances [italics mine], groups are remarkably intelligent and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.”7 Surowiecki begins by telling the story of Francis Galton, the English Victorian-era polymath. In a 1907 article in Nature, Galton describes a contest he promoted at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition. In that contest, 787 people paid sixpence for the opportunity to guess the weight of a rather large ox at the exhibition. A few of the guessers were farmers and butchers, people who might be… ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1244))

- Much has been written about social conformity of groups over the years. Perhaps the most famous social psychology experiments were Solomon Asch’s 1940s studies of individual conformity under group pressure, also described by Mauboussin. Asch first assembled several groups of eight individuals. Each group was then asked to complete a very easy task. Several poster boards were divided in half. On the left-hand side was a single line. On the right-hand side were three unequal lines of which one was identical in length to the line on the left. The groups then had to match the length of the single line to one of the three unequal lines. The first few experiments went smoothly. Then on cue, seven of the eight members (who had been told about the experiment beforehand) purposely matched a noticeably shorter line from the right side to the test line on the left side. Asch wanted to gauge the response of the lone true subject. What happened? Although several of the subjects did hold fast to their initial decision—they remained independent—about one-third of the test subjects altered their decisions so they would conform to the group’s decision. What Asch discovered was that group decisions, even noticeably poor ones, have a profound influence over individual decisions.13 ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1332))

- When catastrophes occur, we naturally seek to identify the principal cause so we can avoid another disaster or at least derive some comfort from knowing what happened. We like it best when we can point to one specific, easily identifiable cause, but that is not always possible. Many scientists believe that large-scale events in biology, geology, and economics are not necessarily the result of a single large event but rather of the unfolding of many smaller events that create an avalanche-like effect. Per Bak, a Danish theoretical physicist (1948–2002), developed a holistic theory of how systems behave called “self-organized criticality.” According to Bak, large complex systems composed of millions of interacting parts can break down not only because of a single catastrophic event but also because of a chain reaction of smaller events. To illustrate the concept of self-criticality, Bak often used the metaphor of a sand pile. Imagine an apparatus that drops one single grain of sand on a large flat table. Initially, the sand spreads across the table and then begins to form a slight pile. As one grain rests on top of another grain, the pile of sand rises until it forms a gentle slope on each side. Eventually, the pile of sand cannot grow any higher. At this point, sand trickles down the slope as fast as the grains are added to the top. In Bak’s analogy, the sand pile is self-organized in the sense that it has formed without anyone placing the individual grains. Each grain of sand is interlocked in countless combinations. When the pile has reached its highest level, we can say the sand is in a state of criticality. It is just on the verge of becoming unstable. When one more grain of sand is added to the pile at that point, that single grain of sand can start an avalanche, with sand rolling down the side slope of the pile. Each rolling grain of sand will stop if it happens to fall into a stable position; otherwise, it continues to fall and possibly hits other grains of sand that may also be unstable, knocking even more grains farther down the side. The avalanche ceases when all unstable grains have fallen as far as they are going to fall. If the shape of the pile of sand has flattened from the avalanche, we can say the pile is in a subcritical phase and will remain there until more sand is added, once again raising the sides of the slope. Per Bak’s sand pile metaphor is a powerful tool that helps us understand the behavior of many different systems. In both natural and social systems, we can see the dynamic: the systems become a class of interlocking subsystems that organize themselves to the edge of criticality and, in some cases, break apart violently only to reorganize themselves at a later point. Is the stock market such a system? Absolutely, said Per Bak. In a joint paper written with two colleagues titled, “Price Variations in a Stock Market with Many Agents,” Bak defended his thesis.14 The three scientists constructed a very simple model that… ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1343))

- it will not be because of self-organized criticality but because of some other science yet to be discovered. That in no way diminishes the significance of Bak’s ideas. Indeed, several notable economists have acknowledged Per Bak’s work on self-organized criticality as a credible explanation for how complex adaptive systems behave, including the Nobel physics laureate Phil Anderson and the Santa Fe Institute’s Brian Arthur. Both recognize that self-organizing systems tend to be dominated by unstable fluctuations and that instability has become an unavoidable property of economic systems. Instability in the stock market is, of course, painfully familiar to everyone involved. It is the treacherous threshold upon which we all too often stub our toes. Surely it would ease our frustration if we understood it better. To get a better fix on the dynamics of instability, we will need to venture back into the social sciences. Diana Richards, a political scientist, is investigating what causes a complex system of interacting agents to become unstable. Or, in Per Bak’s terms, she is trying to determine how a complex system of individuals reaches self-organized criticality. According to Richards, a complex system necessarily involves aggregation of a wide number of choices made by the individuals in the system.15 She calls this “collective choice.” Of course, combining all the individuals’ choices does not always result in a straightforward collective choice; nor should we assume the aggregate choice, which is the sum of individual choices, always leads to stable outcomes. Collective choice, says Richards, occurs when all the agents in the system aggregate information in a way that allows the system to reach a single collective decision. To reach this collective decision, it is not necessary that all the agents hold identical information but that they share a common interpretation of the different choices. Richards believes that this common interpretation, which she calls mutual knowledge, plays a critical role in the stability of all complex systems. The lower the level of this mutual knowledge, the greater the likelihood of instability. An obvious question at this point is how people select from a collection of choices. According to Richards, if there is no clear favorite, the tendency of the system is to continually cycle over the possibilities. You might think… ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1383))

- if mutual knowledge fails, the problem may center on how knowledge is transferred in the system. In the next chapter on psychology, we will turn to our attention to those two points: how individuals form belief structures and how information is exchanged in the stock market. At this point, we have a fixed compass on how to analyze social systems. Whether they are economic, political, or social, we can say these systems are complex (they have a large number of individual units), and they are adaptive (the individual units adapt their behavior on the basis of interactions with other units as well as with the overall system). We also recognize that these systems have self-organizing properties and that, once organized, they generate emergent behavior. Finally, we realize that complex adaptive systems are constantly unstable and periodically reach a state of self-organized criticality. We come to these conclusions by studying a large number of complex adaptive systems across a wide variety of fields in both the natural and the social sciences. In all our study, we are currently limited to understanding how the systems have behaved so far. We have not made the scientific leap that will enable us to predict the future behavior, particularly in complex social systems involving the highly unpredictable units known as human beings. But we may be on the track of something even more valuable. What separates the study of complex natural systems from complex social systems is the possibility that in social systems we can alter the behavior of their individual units.

- Psychology studies how the human mind works. At first glance it may seem far removed from the world of investing, a world of impersonal balance sheets and income statements, especially since the very mention of psychology so frequently calls up an image of a tortured soul stretched out on the therapist’s couch. But mental dysfunction is only one small part of what psychology entails. The word itself means “study of the mind,” and thus psychologists are concerned with understanding all workings of the brain—the part that controls cognition (the process of thinking and knowing), as well as the part that controls emotion. This leads them to investigate how we learn, how we think, how we communicate, how we experience emotions, how we process information and make decisions, and how we form the core beliefs that guide our behavior.

In their article, Thaler and Benartzi took loss aversion described in prospect theory and connected it directly to the stock market.

- The title of this groundbreaking article guides us to two related ideas that call for some discussion: First, that the equity risk premium is puzzling, and second, that loss aversion, unequivocally identified by Kahneman and Tversky, is illogical and prevents investors from seeing long term; that is, it makes them myopic. Equity risk premium is a term many investors have heard but few actually understand. It refers to the potential for higher returns represented by the inherently risky stock market compared to the risk-free rate, defined as the rate of a ten-year U.S. Treasury bond in effect at whatever point you’re considering. (It is called the risk-free rate because up until now the government has never defaulted on its loans.) Whatever return an individual stock or the overall stock market earns beyond that rate is the investor’s compensation for taking on the higher risk of the stock market—the equity risk. For example, if the return on a stock is 10 percent and the risk-free rate is 5 percent over the same period, the equity risk premium would be 5 percent. The size of the risk premium will vary based on the perceived riskiness of a particular stock or the stock market as a whole. According to Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, the implied equity risk premium has vacillated between less than 3 percent in 1961 and 6.5 percent in the early 1980s. Thaler and Benartzi were puzzled by two questions. One, why is the equity risk premium so high; and two, why is anyone willing to hold bonds when we know that over the years, stocks have consistently outperformed? The answer, they believed, rested upon two central concepts from Kahneman and Tversky. The first was loss aversion. The second was a behavioral concept called mental accounting. Mental accounting, explains Thaler, refers to the methods people use to code financial outcomes. To help make the connection, Thaler revisited an older problem first proposed by Paul Samuelson. In 1963, Samuelson asked a colleague if he would be willing to accept the following bet: a 50 percent chance of winning $200 or a 50 percent chance of losing $100. The colleague politely turned down the bet but then announced he would be happy to play the game 100 times so long as he did not have to watch each individual outcome. That counterproposal sparked an idea for Thaler and Benartzi. Samuelson’s colleague was willing to accept the wager with two qualifiers: lengthen the time horizon for the game and reduce the frequency in which he was forced to watch the outcomes. Moving that observation into investing, Thaler and Benartzi reasoned the longer the investor holds an asset, the more attractive the asset becomes but only if the investment is not evaluated frequently. If you don’t check your portfolio every day, you will be spared the angst of watching daily price gyrations; the longer you hold off, the less you will be confronted with volatility and therefore… ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1503))

- Benjamin Graham, through two classic texts—Security Analysis (1934) and The Intelligent Investor ([1949] 1973—has taught three generations of investors how to navigate the stock market. His value-investing approach has helped, without exaggeration, hundreds of thousands of people pick stocks. But often overlooked are his ideas on the psychology of investing. Graham devoted much of his teaching and writing to getting people to understand the critical distinction between investment and speculation. But his message went much deeper than one of mere definitions. We must all come to terms, he insisted, with the idea that common stocks have both an investment characteristic and a speculative characteristic. That is, we know the direction of stock prices is ultimately determined by the underlying economics but we must also recognize that “most of the time common stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuations in both directions, as the consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble—i.e., to give way to hope, fear, and greed.”5 Investors must be prepared, he cautioned, for ups and downs in the market. And he meant prepared psychologically as well as financially–not merely knowing intellectually that a downturn will happen, but having the emotional wherewithal to react appropriately when it does. And what is the appropriate reaction? In his view, an investor should do just what a business owner would do when offered an unattractive price—ignore it. “The investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage,” said Graham. “That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by another person’s mistakes of judgment.”6 With his eloquent comment about “mental anguish,” Graham is speaking directly to the debilitating effects of myopic loss aversion. It would be another forty-five years before Thaler and Benartzi would write their paper. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1564))

- In 1997, Terence Odean, a behavioral economist at the University of California, published a paper titled Why Do Investors Trade Too Much? To answer his question, he reviewed the performance of 10,000 anonymous investors. Over a seven-year period (1987–1993), Odean tracked 97,483 trades among ten thousand randomly selected accounts of a major discount brokerage. The first thing he learned was that the investors sold and repurchased almost 80 percent of their portfolio each year (78 percent turnover ratio). Then he compared the portfolios to the market average over three different time periods (4 months, 1 year, and 2 years). In every case, he found two amazing trends: (1) the stocks that the investors bought consistently trailed the market, and (2) the stocks that they sold actually beat the market.7 Odean wanted to look deeper, so he next examined the trading behavior and performance results of 66,465 house holds. In a paper titled “Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth” (2000), Odean, along with Brad Barber, professor of finance at University of California, Davis, compared the records of people who traded frequently versus people who traded less often. They found that, on average, the most active traders had the poorest results, while those who traded the least earned the highest returns.8 The implication here is that people who might have suffered the most from myopic loss aversion and acted… ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1586))

- Investment professionals put strong emphasis on helping investors accurately assess their tolerance for risk. Seeing their clients boldly add stocks to their portfolio when the market rises only to watch helplessly as they sell stocks and buy bonds when the market swoons has frustrated advisors whose primary responsibility is to properly determine asset allocation. This flipping back and forth between aggressive and then conservative has prompted many to rethink how they should approach the study of risk tolerance. Traditionally, calculating risk tolerance was simple and direct. Through a series of interviews and questionnaires, advisors would ask their client how they would feel about their portfolio under different scenarios. For example, if the stock market went down 20 percent and half the portfolio was invested in stocks, how would you feel if there was a temporary loss of 10 percent of your capital? Then they would pose another hypothetical scenario, and then another. The theory is that, by studying different market scenarios and adjusting the asset allocation, we can perfectly construct a portfolio that matches the client’s risk profile. The problem with this approach is no matter how many different scenarios are examined, the estimation of a client’s risk tolerance will be wrong more times than it will be right. How can that be? According to the distinguished social psychologist Dean G. Pruitt, investors are acting out what is called the “Walter Mitty effect.”10 Walter Mitty is a fictional character in James Thurber’s wonderful short story “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.” It was first published in the The New Yorker in 1939 and later made into a movie (1947) starring Danny Kaye. Walter Mitty was a meek fellow totally intimidated by his overbearing wife. He coped by daydreaming he was magically transformed into a courageous hero. One minute he was dreading facing his wife’s sharp tongue; the next, he was a fearless bomber pilot undertaking a dangerous mission alone. Pruitt believes investors react to the stock market the way Walter Mitty reacted to life. When the market is doing well, they become brave in their own eyes and eagerly accept more risk. But when the market goes down, they rush for the door. So when you ask an investor directly to explain their risk tolerance, the answer comes from either a fearless bomber pilot (in a bull market) or a henpecked husband (in a bear market). How do we overcome the Walter Mitty effect? By finding ways to measure risk tolerance indirectly. You have to look below the surface of the standard questions and investigate the underlying psychological issues. Working with Dr. Justin Green at Villanova University, I was able to develop a risk analysis tool that focused on an individual’s personality rather than asking about risk directly. We identified important demographic factors and personality orientations that, taken together, might help people measure their risk tolerance more accurately. Comfort… ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1615))

- In summary, let us look at how all these personality elements work together. Assuming age and gender variables are equal, we can identify risk-tolerant investors with three traits: They set goals, they believe they control their environment and can affect its outcome, and most important, they view the stock market as a contingency dilemma in which information, combined with rational choices, will produce winning results.

- Psychologists tell us that our ability to understand abstract or complex ideas depends on carrying in our mind a working model of the phenomena. These mental models represent a real or hypothetical situation in the same way that an architect’s model represents a planned building and that a colorful doodad made of Tinkertoy pieces can represent a complicated atomic structure.14 To understand inflation, for example, we use mental models that represent what inflation means to us—experiencing higher gasoline or food prices, perhaps, or paying higher wages to our employees. The first person to propose this thesis was the Scottish psychologist Kenneth Craik. In a short but extraordinary work titled The Nature of Explanation ([1943] 1952), Craik wrote that people are processors of information and that they construct mental models of reality to help anticipate events. With a “small-scale model of external reality and of possible actions” in our head, he believed, we are able to “try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and the future, and in every way react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner to the emergencies which [we] face.”15 The great exploration in psychology, said Craik, is to discover how individuals go about constructing these mental models. Tragically, Craik’s life was cut short by a bicycle accident when he was only thirty-one years old. Since then, much of the research on mental models has been led by Philip N. Johnson-Laird, psychology professor at Princeton University. Through a series of controlled experiments examining how people construct mental models, detailed in his book Mental Models (1983), Johnson-Laird observed several ways that people perform systematic errors in their thinking. First, we tend to assume that each model is equiprobable. That is, given a list of mental models, we are more likely to weight all mental models equally in our thoughts than to adjust the potential contribution of each model differently. It can be said that humans are not mentally wired to perform Bayesian inferences. Johnson-Laird also discovered that when people possess a set of mental models about a particular phenomenon, they often focus on only a few, sometimes only one; obviously relying on a limited number of mental models can lead to erroneous conclusions. We also learn from Johnson-Laird that mental models typically represent what is true but not what is false. We find it much easier to construct a model of what inflation is rather than what it is not. Ongoing research has shown that, overall, our use of mental models is frequently flawed. We construct incomplete representations of the phenomena we are trying to explain. Even when they are accurate, we don’t use them properly. We tend to forget details about the models, particularly when some time has passed, and so our models are often unstable.… ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1662))

- What makes these people so gullible? The answer, according to Michael Shermer in How We Believe (2000), lies in the power of the belief system. We must start with the premise, generally accepted by psychologists, that people are pattern-seeking creatures. Indeed, our survival as a species has depended on this ability. Shermer writes, “Those who are best at finding patterns (standing upwind of game animals is bad for the hunt, cow manure is good for the crops) left behind the most offspring [and] we are their descendants.”16 Through the forces of evolution we are hardwired to seek patterns to explain our world, and those patterns form the foundation of our belief systems, even when they are inherently specious. Shermer suggests that we can better appreciate the role of the belief system when we think back to the Middle Ages. During this period, 90 percent of the population was illiterate. What little scientific information was available was possessed by only a few—the intellectual elite. Everyone else relied on black magic, sorcery, and monsters to explain the workings of their world. The Plague was caused by the misalignment of the stars and planets. The death of a child was caused by vampires or ghouls who lived in caves. A man who saw a shooting star or heard the howl of a wolf in the night would be dead by morning. The Newtonian revolution accompanied by the overall rise of literacy worked to reduce outlandish superstition. Chemistry replaced alchemy. Pascal’s math explained bad luck. Social hygiene reduced disease, and improved medicine prolonged life. Overall, we can say the Age of Science worked to reduce the errors in thinking and irrational beliefs. But it did not, Shermer believes, eliminate magical thinking entirely. Many athletes maintain bizarre rituals to keep their winning streak alive. Lottery players rely on astrological signs. Many people are petrified by the number 13, and countless others refuse to break chain letters for fear of dire consequences. Magical thinking invades all people regardless of education, intelligence, race, religion, or nationality. We were not born in the prehistoric period, argues Shermer, but our minds were built there, and we function largely as we have throughout human history. We still succumb to magical thinking because as pattern-seeking animals we need explanations even for the unexplainable. We distrust… ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1694))

- Is there a solution for noise in the market? Can we distinguish between noise prices and fundamental prices? The obvious answer is to know the economic fundamentals of your investment so you can rightly observe when prices have moved above or below your company’s intrinsic value. It is the same lesson preached by Ben Graham and Warren Buffett. But all too often, deep-rooted psychological issues outweigh this commonsensical advice. It is easy to say we should ignore noise in the market but quite another thing to master the psychological effects of that noise. What investors need is a process that allows them to reduce the noise, which then makes it easier to make rational decisions. That process is nothing more—and nothing less—than the accurate communication of information. In July 1948, the mathematician Claude E. Shannon published a groundbreaking paper for The Bell Systems Technical Journal titled “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” “The fundamental problem of communication,” he wrote, “is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately the message selected at another point.”18 In other words, communication theory is very much about getting information, accurately and completely, from point A to point B. It is both an engineering and a psychological challenge. A communication system consists of five parts:       1.  An information source, which produces a message or a sequence of messages.

- 2.  A transmitter, which operates on the message to produce a signal that can be transmitted over the channel.       3.  A channel, the medium used to transmit the signal from the transmitter to the receiver.       4.  The receiver, which reconstructs the message (the inverse operation of the transmitter).       5.  The destination, the person for whom the message is intended. What is the communication system of investing? Our information source is the stock market or the economy; both continually produce messages or sequencing of messages. The transmitters of the information include writers, reporters, company management, brokers, money managers, analysts, and anyone else who is moved to convey information: taxicab drivers, doctors, next-door neighbors. The channel might be television, radio, newspapers, magazines, journals, Web sites, analysts’ reports, and all manner of casual conversations. The receiver is a person’s mind, the place where the information is processed and reconstructed. The final destination is the investor who takes the reconstructed information and acts on it. Shannon cautioned that there are several points at which information from the source can be degraded before it reaches its destination. The biggest danger, he warned, is noise in the system, whether during delivery over the channel or at either the transmitting or receiving terminal. We should not automatically assume that the transmitters have correctly assembled the information from the source (the market) before the information is placed in the channel. Similarly, the receiver can incorrectly process the information, which can lead to errors at the final destination. We also know that the simultaneous delivery of multiple bits of information over the same channel can raise the noise level. To overcome noise in a communication system, Shannon recommended that what he called a “correction device” be placed between the receiver and the destination. This correcting device would take the information from the receiving terminal, separate out the noise, and then reconstruct the messages so the information arrived correctly at its final destination.

- Shannon’s correction system is a perfect metaphor for how investors should process information. We must mentally place a correcting device in our information channel. The first task for this correcting device is to maintain integrity of the information coming from the source. The device must filter out incorrect source information and reconfigure the signal if it has become garbled. The process for doing this is within our control. To do so means improving our ability to gather and analyze information and use it to further our understanding. The other side of our correcting device, the side that faces the receiving terminal, is responsible for verifying that the information is properly passed through and accurately received, without interference of psychological biases. The process for doing this is also within our control, but it is challenging. We must make ourselves… ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1782))

- Charlie Munger, who gave us the concept of mental models, has spent much time thinking about how we accumulate bits of knowledge from various fields to achieve worldly wisdom. In investing, he says, obviously we need to understand basic accounting and finance. And as we will see in our chapter on mathematics, it is equally important to understand statistics and probabilities. But he believes one of the most important fields is psychology, especially what he calls the psychology of misjudgment. Charlie warns us against taking mental shortcuts. He thinks we jump too easily to conclusions, we are easily misled and prone to manipulation. “Personally, I’ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis,” says Charlie. “First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things—which by and large are useful, but often misfunction.”19 In his own way, Charlie has developed the kind of “correcting device” that Claude Shannon recommends. Psychology—the study of what makes us tick—is endlessly fascinating. I’m especially intrigued that it plays such a strong role in investing, an arena generally thought to be made up of cold numbers. When making investment decisions, our behavior is sometimes erratic, often contradictory, occasionally goofy. Sometimes our illogical decisions are consistently illogical, and sometimes no pattern is discernible.

- Strictly for organizational simplicity, we can separate the study of philosophy into three broad categories. First, critical thinking as it applies to the general nature of the world is known as metaphysics. Physics, we have learned, is the study of the physical world, tangible objects and forces in nature. It is the study of tables and chairs and their molecular components, of inclined planes and free-falling balls, and of the laws of motion that control the sun and the moon. Metaphysics means “beyond physics.” When philosophers discuss metaphysical questions, they are describing ideas that exist independently from our own space and time. Examples include the concepts of God and the afterlife. These are not tangible events like tables and chairs but rather abstract ideas that exist apart from our natural world. Philosophers who debate metaphysical questions readily concede the existence of the world that surrounds us but disagree about the essential nature and the meaning of that world. The second body of philosophical inquiry is the investigation of three related areas: aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Aesthetics is the theory of beauty. Philosophers who engage in aesthetic discussions are trying to ascertain what it is that people find beautiful, whether it be in the objects they observe or in the state of mind they achieve. This study of the beautiful should not be thought of as a superficial inquiry, because how we conceive beauty can affect our judgments of what is good and bad. Ethics is the philosophical branch that studies the issues of right and wrong. It asks what is moral and what is immoral, what behavior is appropriate and what behavior is inappropriate. Ethics makes inquiries into the activities people undertake, the judgments they make, the values they hold, and the character they aspire to achieve. Closely connected to the idea of ethics is the philosophy of politics. Whereas ethics investigates what is right or wrong at the societal level, political philosophy is a debate over how societies should be organized, what laws should be passed, and what connections peoples should have to these societal organizations. Epistemology, the third body of inquiry, is the branch of philosophy that seeks to understand the limits and nature of knowledge. The term itself comes from the Greek words epiteme, meaning “knowledge,” and logos, which literally means “discourse” and more broadly refers to any kind of study or intellectual investigation. Epistemology then is the study of the theory of knowledge. To put it simply, when we make an epistemological inquiry, we are thinking about thinking.

- Thinking is much more than just acquiring knowledge, and the process of thinking can be done badly or well. By learning to think well, we can better avoid confusion, noise, and ambiguities. Not only will we become more aware of possible alternatives, we will be more capable of making reliable arguments. How we think about investing ultimately determines how we do it. If we can consciously adopt an epistemological framework, always considering at some level whether our thinking process is rigorous and cohesive, we can go a long way toward improving our investment results.

- “Failure to explain is caused by failure to describe!” His voice was so loud it exploded, booming throughout the room. There was no mistaking its intent. Someone was angry and frustrated. Stunned, we all sat frozen in our seats. The audience went silent. Slowly a few turned around to see who had the fired the vocal bazooka—it was Benoit Mandelbrot. The topic that night was a big one: is the stock market efficient—or not? It was part of a three-day seminar at the Santa Fe Institute titled “Beyond Equilibrium and Efficiency,” organized by J. Doyne Farmer, a research professor at the institute, and John Geanakoplos of the Cowles Foundation at Yale. In attendance was a diverse group of physicists, economists, mathematicians, finance professors, and money managers, including some of the best investment minds in the world.

- Benoit Mandelbrot (1924–2010) was a maverick mathematician. He spent thirty-five years at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center before moving to Yale, where, at the age of seventy-five, he became the oldest professor in the university’s history to receive tenure. Along the way he received more than fifteen honorary doctorates. Mandelbrot developed the field of fractal geometry (he coined the term) and applied it to physics, biology, and finance. A fractal is defined as a rough or fragmented shape that can split into parts, each of which is at the least a close approximation of its original self. This is a property called self-similarity. About now you might be thinking, “I wouldn’t know a fractal if one hit me in the head.” But you may be surprised to learn that fractals are easily found in nature; they surround us, and we observe them every day. Examples include clouds, mountains, trees, ferns, river networks, cauliflower, and broccoli. The recursive nature of each of these is somewhat obvious. The branch from a tree or a frond from a fern is a miniature of its whole. Below the surface we have discovered that blood vessels and pulmonary vessels are a fractal system. And from thirty thousand feet looking down, we can see that a coastline, once thought to be impossible to measure, is one of nature’s fractals. For those who are now intrigued, Mandelbrot’s The Fractal Geometry of Nature (1982) is considered the seminal book that brought fractals into the mainstream of professional mathematics. What I find fascinating about Mandelbrot is not the mathematical rigor of fractals (which is obviously impressive) but the realization that he looked at nature’s constituents, as we all have, but saw something different. “Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.”4 Because his description of clouds and lightning is different from ours, it should not be surprising his explanation differed. Now we can better appreciate his late-night pronouncement that “failure to explain is caused by failure to describe.” Are descriptions important in investing? You bet they are. But our study of descriptions will not take us to the mathematics department; that part will come later. Rather, we will stay with the philosophy curriculum and next meet someone who is arguably the most distinguished philosopher of the twentieth century. Bertrand Russell described him as “the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.” ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=1930))

- To help us better understand how this new philosophy of meaning actually worked, Wittgenstein drew a very simple three-sided figure. He then writes, “Take as an example the aspects of a triangle. This triangle can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical drawing, as standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a mountain, as a wedge, as an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object, which is meant to stand on the shorter side of the right angle, as a half parallelogram, and as various other things…. You can think now of this now of this as you look at it, can regard it now as this now as this, and then you will see it now this way, now this.” It is a compelling, even poetic way to describe his belief that reality is shaped by the words we select. Words give meaning.8 How does this relate to investing? As we will see, stocks have a lot in common with Wittgenstein’s triangle. On May 15, 1997, Amazon.com (Amazon) became a publicly traded company.9 The target price set by the underwriters was $18 per share. It finished its first full day of trading at $23—a 28 percent one-day gain. By December 1999, in the midst of the technology bubble, the stock traded over $100 per share. Unfazed, a few analysts predicted Amazon.com would soon be a $300 stock. The company was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. One year later, Amazon went live on the Internet as an online bookstore. During the technology bubble and the collapse afterwards, so many Internet companies were born and soon buried that it was hard to keep track. But Amazon made it through to the other side. When the NASDAQ Composite, home for many of the Internet newborns, finally bottomed on October 9, 2002, down 78 percent from its 1999 high, Amazon was still standing. You might think investors would have congratulated the company for surviving the tech crash. But soon analysts were claiming Amazon was still massively overpriced. Although the company had sidestepped the guillotine, they said, its days were numbered. By year-end 2002, Amazon was trading ninety times cash flow and posted a $2.4 million earnings loss. The bear case rested on the fact that as a book retailer, Amazon appeared massively overpriced relative to brick-and-mortar bookstores. Even when the company diversified into DVDs, CDs, computer software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, toys, and food, the brick-and-mortar description stuck. The bears first compared Amazon to Barnes & Noble then later to Wal-Mart. In both cases, Amazon’s price to earnings and price to cash flow were significantly higher than the traditional retailers. Conversely, the Amazon bulls looked at the company and saw something different. To them Amazon did not look like Barnes & Noble or Wal-Mart but instead resembled Dell Computer (Dell). Initially, the bears were shocked by the comparison. Dell was a direct distributor of personal computers and computer products. It was one of the best-performing stocks during the 1990s.

- The words we choose give meaning (description) to what we observe. In order to further explain and/or defend our description, we in turn develop a story about what we believe is true. There is nothing wrong with storytelling. In fact, it is a very effective way of transferring ideas. If you stop and think, the way we communicate with each other is basically through a series of stories. Stories are open-ended and metaphorical rather than determinate. Think back to our first chapter where Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors We Live By) remind us that we fundamentally think and act metaphorically. Today, scientists and philosophers have dropped the word “storytelling” and instead use the word “narrative.” Indeed, it appears that “narrative” has now slipped into the mainstream. Philosophers, doctors, and scientists speak of “narrative knowledge” as “what one uses to understand the meaning and significance of stories through cognitive, symbolic, and effective means.”11 Journalists and politicians also use the word. During elections we are told about a candidate’s “narrative” or the need for the candidates to “change their narrative.” And yes, investors use narratives. There is a narrative about the economic recovery following the financial… ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2022))

- An individual who has given this subject a great deal of thought is John Allen Paulos, professor of mathematics at Temple University. Paulos is a best-selling author, best known for Innumeracy (1988) and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper (1995). Both books are enjoyable reads, but it was his 1998 book, Once Upon a Number: The Hidden Mathematical Logic of Stories, that is best connected to our philosophy chapter. Paulos tells us people are very good at storytelling. They are also decent at statistics. But rarely does the storyteller import a statistical defense for the story. Likewise, people are capable of citing good statistics but rarely can they put the statistical revelation into proper context. “Unfortunately, people generally ignore the connections between the formal notions of statistics and the informal understanding and stories from which they grow,” says Paulos. “They consider numbers as coming from a different realm than narratives and not as distillations, complements, or summaries of them. People often cite statistics in bald form, without the supporting story and context needed to give them meaning.” ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2050))

- When we listen to stories we have the tendency to suspend disbelief in order to be entertained, says Paulos. But when we evaluate statistics, we are less willing to suspend disbelief in order that we are not duped. Paulos goes on to describe the two types of errors in formal statistics. Type I error occurs when we observe something that is not really there. A Type II error occurs when we fail to observe something that is actually there. According to Paulos, those who like to be entertained and wish to avoid making a Type II error are more likely to prefer stories over statistics. Those who do not necessarily yearn for entertainment but are desperate to avoid Type I errors are apt to prefer statistics to stories.14 For investors it is important to realize the slippery slope of narratives. Storytelling inadvertently increases our confidence in propositions as the story itself becomes its own proof. “The focus of stories is on the individual rather than the averages, on motives rather than movements, on context rather than raw data,” explains Paulos.15 Because investors primarily use storytelling to explain… ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2060))

Even so, we go to great lengths to defend our chosen description, constructing elaborate and entertaining stories in order to make our point despite the risk of statistical inconsistencies.

- In investing, no one is perfect. Some of our mistakes will be minor and easy to overcome. Others will be intransigent. It is difficult to navigate our faults, particularly if they are steadfast and deeply held beliefs. To be a successful investor we must be prepared for redescriptions. Fortunately there is a philosophical guidepost that will make our journey easier and more sensible. We find such a guidepost in the philosophy of pragmatism. As a formal branch of philosophy, pragmatism is only about one hundred years old; it was first brought to public attention by William James in an 1898 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley. In his lecture, “Philosophical Conceptions and Practical… ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2079))

- Through lively discussions at the Metaphysical Club, Peirce refined his theories and eventually came to this proposition: It is through thinking that people resolve doubts and form their beliefs, and their subsequent actions follow from those beliefs and become habits. Therefore anyone who seeks to determine the true definition of a belief should look not at the belief itself but at the actions that result from it. He called this proposition “pragmatism,” a term, he pointed out, with the same root as practice or practical, thus cementing his view that the meaning of an idea is the same as its practical results. “Our idea of anything,” he explained, “is our idea of its sensible effects.” In his classic 1878 paper, “How to Make Our Ideas Clear,” Peirce continued: “The whole function of thought is to produce habits of action. To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habit it involves.”17 When originally published, “How to Make Our Ideas Clear” caused few ripples outside Peirce’s small circle. But another club member, William James, was profoundly influenced by Peirce’s ideas, and twenty years later brought them to the attention of the general public, beginning with the Berkeley lecture in 1898. Peirce, we should point out, was concerned with developing a logical way of solving philosophical problems—specifically, a method for establishing the meaning of things. He intended this concept to be applied principally to scientific inquiry. James, for his part, took Peirce’s method and applied it to thinking in general. He moved away from the narrow question of both meaning and truth. A belief is true, James said, not because it can stand up to logical scrutiny but rather because holding it puts a person into more useful relations with the world. Like Peirce, James concluded that philosophers had wasted far too much time debating abstract principles (metaphysical issues) and trying to prove or disprove various philosophical tenets. Instead, he argued, they should ask what practical effects come from holding one philosophical view over another. More bluntly, James asks, in his famous statement, “what is the cash-value” of the belief in terms of a person’s practical experience? James, a popular and charismatic lecturer, soon became much better known than Peirce as the chief proponent of pragmatism. Eventually, Peirce distanced himself from James’s work and even gave his own theory a slightly different name: pragmaticism, a term he called “too ugly to be kidnapped.” In his later years Peirce became an eccentric, poverty-stricken recluse. William James contributed to his financial support and never failed to acknowledge Peirce as the founder of the philosophical movement for which he, James, became famous.

- To state the matter as simply as possible, pragmatism holds that truth (in statements) and rightness (in actions) are defined by their practical outcomes. An idea or an action is true, and real, and good, if it makes a meaningful difference. To understand something, then, we must ask what difference it makes, what its consequences are. “Truth,” James wrote, “is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief.”18 If truth and value are determined by their practical applications in the world, then it follows that truth will change as circumstances change and as new discoveries about the world are made. Our understanding of truth evolves. Darwin smiles. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2131))

- The great use of beliefs, James pointed out, is to help summarize old facts and then lead the way to new ones. After all, he reminded the audience, all our beliefs are man-made. They are a conceptual language we use to write down our observations of nature, and as such, they become the choice of our experience. Thus, he summarized, “ideas (which themselves are but parts of our experience) become true just in so far as they help us get into satisfactory relation with other parts of our experience.” ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2153))

- An individual has a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new experience that puts them to strain. Somebody contradicts them; or in a reflective moment he discovers that they contradict each other; or he hears of facts with which they are incompatible; or desires arise in him which they cease to satisfy. The result is inward trouble to which his mind till then had been a stranger and from which he seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions. He saves as many of them as he can, for in this matter of belief we are all extreme conservatives. So he tries to change first that opinion and then that (for they resist change very variously), until at least some idea comes up that he can graft upon the ancient stock with a minimum of disturbances of the latter, some idea that mediates between the stock and the new experience and runs them into one another most felicitously and expediently.21 ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2160))

- What happens, to summarize James, is that the new idea is adopted while the older truths are preserved with as little disruption as possible. The new truths are simply go-betweens, transition-smoothers, that help us get from one point to the next. “Our thoughts become true,” says James, “as they successfully exert their go-between function.”22 A belief is true and has “cash-value” if it helps us get from one place to another. Truth then becomes a verb, not a noun. ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2170))

- We learn by trying new things, by being open to new ideas, by thinking differently. This is how knowledge progresses.

- What is the best measure of value? Most believe John Burr Williams’s theory of discounted cash flow (DCF) is the best model for determining economic value. We should think of Williams’s DCF model as being a “first-order model.” However, many investors shy away from its inherent difficulties.24 Instead, they drop down one level of explanation and select one of the second-order models—perhaps low price-to-earnings ratios or some other accounting factor-based measure—which they rigidly hold up as the only correct approach. The stock market is a giant discounting mechanism that is constantly repricing stocks. There are occasions when the stocks that offer the greatest discount to the company’s cash flows (the DCF model) are stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios; at other times the greatest discounts can be found in those stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios. No one metric is absolute; none is always right. Pragmatic investors can, and should, apply any second-order model that is fruitful and discard any that are worthless, all without violating the first order. Remember, James tells us that even “the most violent revolutions in an individual’s beliefs leave most of his old order standing.” Even when we adopt a new idea, we can still preserve the older ones with minimum modification. From a pragmatist’s point of view, it is permissible, even advisable, to search for those explanations that work. “Stretch them enough to make them admit the novelty,” James said, “but conceiving in ways as familiar as the case leaves possible.”25 The philosophic foundation of successful investors is twofold. First, they quickly recognize the difference between first- and second-order models, and as such they never become a prisoner of the second-order absolutes. Second, they carry their pragmatic investigations far from the field of finance and economics. It can be best thought of as a Rubik’s Cube approach to investing. The successful investor should enthusiastically examine every issue from every possible angle, from every possible discipline, to get the best possible description—or redescription—of what is going on. Only then is an investor in a position to accurately explain. The only way to do better than someone else, or more importantly, to outperform the stock market, is to have a way of interpreting the data that is different from other people’s interpretations. To that I would add the need to have sources of information and experiences that are different.26 In studying the great minds in investing, the one trait that stands out is the broad reach of their interests. Once your field of vision is widened, you are able to understand more fully what you observe, and then you use those insights for greater investment success. We live and work in a world in which the pace of change is staggering; just when you think things can’t possibly move any faster, the pace once again accelerates. In such a world, successful performance demands flexible thinking. In an… ([Location 2205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2205))

- Charlie Munger, whose concept of a latticework of mental models inspired this book, is sometimes asked, when he describes his concept to audiences, how a person goes about learning those models. They may use different words to frame their question, but essentially those in the audience are asking, “I certainly understand the value of knowing key ideas from different disciplines and building my own latticework, but I didn’t learn any of that in school, and I’d be starting from ground zero. Frankly, it seems overwhelming. How do I cultivate the kind of depth and breadth of knowledge that leads to worldly wisdom?” Charlie is not known for pulling his punches; his answer is blunt. Most people didn’t get the right kind of education, he says; too many academic departments are too narrow, too territorial, too self-absorbed with parochial issues to focus on what they should be about, which is helping students become truly educated people. Even earning a degree from a prestigious university is no guarantee that we have acquired what he calls worldly wisdom or even started on the path toward it.

In electronic communications systems, the correcting device is a literal, tangible piece of equipment.

- In addition to the complete reading list of Great Books over a four-year period, nearly every St. John’s student becomes intimately familiar with one book that is not on the list: How to Read a Book, by Mortimer J. Adler.4 Scores of dog-eared, highlighted, margin-scribbled copies circulate among the students, many of whom consider it an indispensable tool for getting the most from their reading. A surprise bestseller when first published in 1940, this remarkable book was revised in 1972 and is still in print, still carefully passed around at St. John’s.5 ([Location 2345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2345))

- when you come across a work that makes you stop, think, and reread for clarification, chances are this process is increasing your understanding. Using this as a litmus test, think about how much of the reading you have done over the past year was for information and how much was for increased understanding. The process of moving from understanding less to understanding more is a critical journey for anyone who wishes to gain wisdom. It is not a simple matter of reading one book, setting it aside, and reaching for the next one. Achieving real understanding requires you to work, to think. To the degree that your reading involves subjects that are new to you, you as a reader start out on unequal footing with the writer—the writer knows more about the subject than you do. The more unfamiliar you are with the material, the more effort you will need to overcome this inequality. Also, some writers are, by their style of writing, simply more difficult to grasp; their works, too, take more effort on our part. Adler compares it to the relationship between a pitcher and a catcher in baseball. Pitchers, like some writers, can be wild and out of control, which requires the catcher (the reader) to work harder. Therefore, if you are going to become a good reader, you will sometimes have to make an extra effort to catch a loosely pitched idea. Adler proposes that all active readers need to keep four fundamental questions in mind:6 ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2365))

- 1.  What is the book about as a whole?       2.  What is being said in detail?       3.  Is the book true, in whole or part?       4.  What of it? No matter how long the material, its format (fiction or nonfiction), or the immediate purpose for reading it (to gain information, to enhance broader knowledge, or for sheer pleasure), you should always be evaluating the material from the perspective of these four fundamental questions if you want to read intelligently. To determine, as quickly as possible, what the book is about (question 1), Adler suggests a fast review. First, read the preface. Here the author typically gives a brief explanation of the book, the rationale for writing it, and perhaps an outline of what to expect. Next, look carefully at the table of contents; it will give you a good overview of what the book is about. Then turn to the back and run through the index, looking for familiar as well as unfamiliar terms. This will give you a sense of the book’s major topics. You can also learn much about the book from its bibliography. Do you recognize the names of the authors… ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2379))

- This entire exercise, from reading the preface, table of contents, index, and bibliography to systematically skimming, should take at most thirty minutes to an hour. You can do this standing in a brick-and-mortar bookstore or online, taking advantage of the “peek inside” benefit available from many online booksellers. At the end, you should know what the book is about as a whole, and that will tell you whether you wish to take your valuable time to read it. If you do, Adler suggests you start with a complete but somewhat superficial reading. Here you will begin to answer the second fundamental question: What is the book about in detail? That will tell you whether you want to invest the time for a serious, analytical read. The goal now is to get through the book without getting bogged down in small distractions such as unfamiliar vocabulary. Pay attention to what you understand, and skip over the parts that are difficult. Caution: This requires concentration. Even though you are skimming the book, you should not let yourself daydream. Stay alert and focus on what you are reading so that you can comprehend the basics of the material.

- (what the book is about as a whole and in detail), and you will begin to answer the third question: Is the book true? Analytical reading has three goals: (1) to develop a detailed sense of what the book contains, (2) to interpret the contents by examining the author’s own particular point of view on the subject, and (3) to analyze the author’s success in presenting that point of view convincingly. You may find it helpful at first to approach analytical reading the way you would approach assigned reading in a college class. Have a notepad at hand, and make your own outline of the key topics, chapter by chapter. Write down, in your own words, what you deduce is the author’s main purpose in writing the book. List what you think are the author’s main primary arguments, and then compare that list against the outline of contents. Decide for yourself whether the author has fulfilled the original goals, defended the arguments, and convinced you of the main thesis. Ask yourself whether the author seems illogical or presents material that you know from other sources is inaccurate. If something seems incomplete or unsatisfactory, does the author candidly acknowledge that a full answer was not possible, rather than trying to bluff the readers? After you have read several books in this detailed way, you will very likely find that your analytical skills are improving and that you can proceed without the notepad by your side. You will, however, always be concerned with answering these fundamental questions: What is the book about in detail, and is it true? The detailed examination of the book that you perform with analytical reading will also begin to answer the fourth fundamental question: What of it? That is to say, what is the significance of this material? A full answer to that question, however, comes only at a still-deeper level of reading, what Adler calls synoptical reading, or comparative reading. (We’ll use the latter term here, for I believe it is more descriptive.) In this level of reading, we are interested in learning about a certain subject, and to do so we compare and contrast the work of several authors rather than focusing on just one work by one author. Adler considers this the most demanding and most complex level of reading. It involves two challenges: first, searching for other possible books on the subject and then deciding, after finding them,… ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2404))

- analysis of each book individually but finding the important parts of each separate book that relate to what you need to know. This is a fundamentally different approach from analyzing a book in its entirety. In analytical reading, you accept information from the author as it is given; in comparative reading, your investigation must serve your own needs. Develop your list of questions, expressed in your own language, and analyze how well the selected books answer those questions. Do not be dismayed if the authors give different answers to your questions, but do take the time to determine the context for each author’s answer. The final step in comparative reading is analyzing the discussion among all the authors. Be careful not to take sides but to let the debate between authors unfold with some objectivity. Of course, perfect objectivity is rarely possible, but the more you can resist jumping to conclusions, the better will be your overall understanding. At the end, you will have answered the last of Adler’s fundamental questions: What of it?

- Let’s take a moment to put into perspective what we have been learning in this chapter. We start with this irrefutable point: The mental skill of critical analysis is fundamental to success in investing. Perfecting that skill—developing the mind-set of thoughtful, careful analysis—is intimately connected to the skill of thoughtful, careful reading. Each one reinforces the other in a kind of double feedback loop. Good readers are good thinkers; good thinkers tend to be great readers and in the process learn to be even better thinkers. So the very act of reading critically improves your analytical skills. At the same time, the content of what you read adds to your compendium of knowledge, and this is enormously valuable. If you decide to expand your knowledge base by reading in areas outside finance, including some of the other disciplines presented in this book, you are assembling the individual elements to construct your own latticework of mental models. Or, to put the matter more directly, learning to be a careful reader has two enormous benefits to investors: it makes you smarter in an overall sense, and it makes you see the value of developing a critical mind-set, not necessarily taking information at face value. This critical mind-set, in turn, has two aspects that relate to the reading process: (1) evaluate the facts, and (2) separate fact from opinion. To see the process at work, let us briefly consider an analyst’s report. I chose this as a specific example because we all spend so much time reading them, but of course the general approach can be, and should be, used universally.

- So far we have been learning about doing careful reading of expository works, but knowledge, insight, and wisdom are not limited to works of nonfiction. Novels, poetry, essays, plays, short stories, even so-called popular fiction can nurture and replenish our understanding of the world we live in. Noting that they appeal more to our imagination than to our intellect, Adler puts all these types of books under the all-inclusive label of imaginative literature. Although in a very real sense the four fundamental questions apply with equal significance to all kinds of books, reading imaginative material is, Adler believes, far more difficult than reading expository books. Expository books convey knowledge, he explains. When we are reading them, our goal is to determine their truth. Imaginative books, on the other hand, convey an experience. The beauty of a book relates to that experience. However, this experience is highly subjective and therefore impossible to analyze. Our challenge as readers is to welcome this experience, to open wide our senses and our imagination. “Don’t try to resist the effect that a work of imaginative literature has on you,” says Adler. “Let it do whatever work it wants to do.” ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2532))

- In other ways, however, critically reading fiction is like critically reading nonfiction. You must still attend to the content by understanding the characters and their relationships. You must still find the author’s main points by fully inhabiting the imaginary world of the novel. You must still follow the author’s “argument” by allowing yourself to experience what the characters experience. In the end, however, the basic question is not whether you agree or disagree with the book but whether you do or do not like it—and why.

- The more practical-minded among you may be wondering what investors can learn from imaginative literature. If it doesn’t add any new insights about investing, why allocate your valuable time to it? My answer is simple: because we learn from experiences—and not only from our own. Just as we learn from our daily experiences how to become better mates, parents, citizens, and investors, so too can we learn from the fictional experiences that fine writers place in our imagination. One individual who passionately believes in the power of imaginative literature is Benjamin Doty, senior investment director at Koss Olinger in Gainesville, Florida. He is one of those rare individuals in our business who, while making his living as an investment professional, can see the benefits of reading great literature. In addition to the informational tabloids we are all required to read, Doty’s reading list includes William Shakespeare, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Joseph Conrad, William Dean Howells, and Philip Roth. Doty’s ability to connect investing to literature is a direct result of his combined graduate education in business and English. This would explain why, at the height of the dot-com bubble, he was reading Theodore Dreiser’s The Financier, which follows the rise and fall of a gifted banker who made and lost several fortunes in the nineteenth century. According to Doty, the lesson of The Financier is very much about unchecked greed and extreme ambition. He remembers at the time thinking the moral of the story, which is an indictment of excess capitalism, was the perfect antidote to the philosophy of objectivism, a late twentieth-century idea developed by Ayn Rand and largely made popular by Alan Greenspan, who believed unfettered laissez-faire capitalism was the right moral compass for financial order. Years later, Doty read Robert Shiller’s The Subprime Solution, which examines the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008. It started him thinking about the “human factor,” the way the financial crisis permanently harmed so many people up and down the social strata. Doty believed the time was right to change the zeitgeist—the moral trend of our investing culture. The following year, as adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, Benjamin Doty was teaching a new class called “The American Novel, Business and Financial Crisis.” In his class, Doty begins with Shiller’s analysis of the financial crisis and then introduces Macbeth, Richard III, The Great Gatsby, Oil!, The Heart of Darkness, The Rise of Silas Lapham, American Pastoral, and of course his favorite, The Financier. Doty believes that in writing The Financier, Dreiser was in effect trying to change the zeitgeist. “We shouldn’t underestimate the power of literature in a world where most of the business reading consists of corporate profiles, technical manuals and self-help guides,” says Doty. Literature adds what most business nonfiction cannot—it dramatizes the complexity of events.… ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2559))

- To this day, whenever I start a new detective story I construct a mental list of the suspects and search intensely for clues. For me, the ultimate pleasure of reading a mystery is the chance to solve the crime before the detective does. Looking back, I have often wondered whether my fascination with detective fiction led to my interest in investing. In a fundamental way, solving a mystery is similar to figuring out whether a security is priced accurately. Both are puzzles. The detective gathers clues to determine whether a suspect is guilty or innocent. A security analyst gathers financial data and industry facts to determine whether the market is accurately assessing a company’s value, in the form of its stock price, that particular day.

- But it doesn’t have to be this way. Alan Jacobs, professor of English at Wheaton College in Illinois and author of The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction, argues, “The cause of reading is not a lost one.” In his mind, reading ought to be a pleasurable activity. “We should be reading for the sake of reading,” he exclaims, “rather than reading for the sake of having read.”13 Reading is good for the mind. Even if you were fortunate enough to have the sort of broad education advocated by Benjamin Franklin and pursued at institutions like St. John’s College, you will want to continue reading throughout your life. Exploring challenging ideas keeps your mind stimulated, open, and alive. And if your education gave you specific and “practical” knowledge but not broad understanding, then it is up to you to do the rest—to fill in the knowledge your education did not provide. In either case, the process is easier, and more fruitful, if you learn the skills of an intelligent, analytical reader. I wish I could guarantee that this approach to reading will automatically give you Charlie Munger’s worldly wisdom. It will not. By itself, reading is insufficient. You must put yourself—your own good brain and some of your soul—into the process, by reflecting on what you read. Indeed, the harder you work to understand and absorb the material, the more deeply embedded it becomes. As Charlie himself puts it, “Good literature makes [you] reach a little. Then it works better. If you’ve reached for it, the idea’s pounded in better.”14 But if you are still skeptical about all of this and worried about taking on even more reading than you already have, especially reading that you fear will be too difficult, listen once more to Charlie: I believe in … mastering the best that other people have figured out [rather than] sitting down and trying to dream it up yourself…. You won’t find it that hard if you go at it Darwinlike, step by step with curious persistence. You’ll be amazed at how good you can get…. It’s a huge mistake not to absorb elementary worldly wisdom…. Your life will be enriched—not only financially but in a host of other ways—if you do.15 ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2667))

- Nightingale, perched upon an oak, was seen by Hawk, who swooped down and snatched him. Nightingale, begging earnestly, besought Hawk to let him go, insisting he wasn’t big enough to satisfy the hunger of Hawk, who ought instead to pursue larger birds. Hawk replied, “I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready to my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are not even seen within sight.” Undoubtedly you recognize the fable of “The Hawk and the Nightingale,” and you already know the moral of the story: “A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.” ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2692))

- comes from Warren Buffett: “A girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.” I am quite sure that when Aesop wrote “The Hawk and the Nightingale” 2,600 years ago, he had no idea he was laying down one of the definitive laws of investing. Listen to Buffett: “The formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical. Indeed, the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C.E. The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, insight was ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’ To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush—and the maximum number of birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don’t literally think birds. Think dollars.”1 Buffett goes on to say that Aesop’s investment axiom is immutable. And it matters not whether you apply the fable to stocks, bonds, manufacturing plants, farms, oil royalties, or lottery tickets. Buffett also points out that Aesop’s “formula” survived the advent of the steam engine, electricity, automobiles, airplanes, and the Internet. All you need to do, Buffett says, is insert the correct numbers and the attractiveness of all investment opportunities will be rank-ordered.

- Buffett gives a great deal of thought about the company he is going to invest with as well as the industry the company operates within. He also closely examines the behavior of management, particularly how management thinks about allocating capital.2 These are all important variables, but they are largely subjective measurements. As such, they do not easily lend themselves to mathematical computation. In contrast, Buffett’s mathematical principles of investing are straightforward. He has often said he can do most business-value calculations on the back of an envelope. First, tabulate the cash. Second, estimate the growth probabilities of the cash coming and going over the life of the business. Then, discount the cash flows to present value.

- You may be asking yourself, if the discounted present value of future cash flows is the immutable law for determining value, why do investors rely on relative valuation factors, second-order models? Because predicting a company’s future cash flows is so very difficult. We can calculate the future cash flows of a bond with near certainty—it’s a contractual obligation. But a business does not have a contractual obligation to generate a fixed rate of return. A business does the best it can, but many forces—the vagaries of the economy, the intensity of competitors, and innovators who have the ability to disrupt an industry—combine to make predictions about future cash flows less than precise. That doesn’t excuse us from making the effort, for as Buffett often quips, “I would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.” ([Location 2769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2769))

- Pascal and Fermat exchanged a series of letters, which ultimately formed the basis of what today is called probability theory. In Against the Gods, the brilliant treatise on risk, Peter Bernstein writes that this correspondence “signaled an epochal event in the history of mathematics and the theory of probability.”3 Although they attacked the problem differently—Fermat used algebra whereas Pascal turned to geometry—each was able to construct a system for determining the probability of several possible but not yet realized outcomes. Indeed, Pascal’s geometric triangle of numbers can be used today to solve many problems, including the probability that your favorite baseball team will win the World Series after losing the first game. The contributions of Pascal and Fermat mark the beginning of what we now call decision theory—the process by which we can make optimal decisions even in the face of an uncertain future. “Making that decision,” wrote Bernstein, “is the essential first step in any effort to manage risk.”4 We now know probability theory is a potent instrument for forecasting. But, as we also know, the devil is in the details. In our case, the details are the quality of information, which forms the basis for the probability estimate. The first person to think scientifically about probabilities and information quality was Jacob ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2791))

- Bernoulli, a member of the famed Dutch-Swiss family of mathematicians that also included both Johann and Daniel Bernoulli. Jacob Bernoulli recognized the differences between establishing odds for a game of chance and odds for answering life’s dilemmas. As he pointed out, you do not need to actually spin the roulette wheel to figure out the odds of the ball landing on the number seventeen. However, in real life, relevant information is essential in understanding the probability of an outcome. As Bernoulli explained, nature’s patterns are only partly established, so probabilities in nature should be thought of as degrees of certainty, not as absolute certainty. Although Pascal, Fermat, and Bernoulli are credited with developing the theory of probability, it was another mathematician, Thomas Bayes, who laid the groundwork for putting the theory into practical action. Thomas Bayes (1701–1761) was both a Presbyterian minister and a talented mathematician. Born one hundred years after Fermat and seventy-eight years after Pascal, Bayes lived an unremarkable life in the British county of Kent, south of London. He was elected to membership in the Royal Society in 1742 on the basis of his treatise, published anonymously, about Sir Isaac Newton’s calculus. During his lifetime, he published nothing else in mathematics. However, he stipulated in his will that at his death a draft of an essay he had written and one hundred pounds sterling was to be given to Richard Price, a preacher in neighboring Newington Green. Two years after Bayes’s death, Price sent a copy of the paper, “Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances,” to John Canton, a member of the Royal Society. In his paper, Bayes laid down the foundation for the method of statistical inference—the issue first proposed by Jacob Bernoulli. In 1764, the Royal Society published Bayes’s essay in its journal, Philosophical Transactions. According to Peter Bernstein, it was a “strikingly original piece of work that immortalized Bayes among statisticians, economists, and other social scientists.”5 Bayes’s theorem is strikingly simple: When we update our initial belief with new information, we get a new and improved belief. In Sharon Bertsch McGrayne’s thoughtful book on Bayes, The Theory That Would Not Die, she succinctly lays out the Bayesian process. “We modify our opinions with objective information: Initial Beliefs + Recent Objective Data = A New and Improved Belief.” Later mathematicians assigned terms to each part of the method. Priori is the probability of the initial belief; likelihood for the probability of a new hypothesis based on recent objective data; and posterior for the probability of a newly revised belief. McGrayne tells us “each time the system is recalculated, the posterior becomes the prior of the new iteration. It was an evolving system, with each bit of new information pushed closer and closer to certitude.”6 Darwin smiles. Bayes’s theorem gives us a mathematical… ([Location 2804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2804))

- There are two broad categories of probability interpretations. The first is called physical probabilities, more commonly referred to as frequency probabilities. They are commonly associated with systems that can generate tons of data over very long periods. Think roulette wheels, flipping coins, and card and dice games. But frequency probabilities can also include probability estimates for automobile accidents and life expectancy. Yes, cars and drivers are different, but there are enough similarities among people driving in a particular area that tons of data can be generated over a multiyear period that in turn will give you frequency-like interpretations. When a sufficient frequency of events, along with an extended time period to analyze the results, is not available, we must turn to evidential probabilities, commonly referred to as subjective probabilities. It is important to remember, a subjective probability can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent the “subjective” plausibility. According to the textbooks on Bayesian analysis, “if you believe your assumptions are reasonable, it is perfectly acceptable to make your subjective probability of a certain event equal to a frequency probability.”8 What you have to do is to sift out the unreasonable and illogical in favor of reasonable. A subjective probability, then, is not based on precise computations but is often a reasonable assessment made by a knowledgeable person. Unfortunately, when it comes to money, people are not consistently reasonable or knowledgeable. We also know that subjective probabilities can contain a high degree of personal bias. Any time subjective probabilities are in use, it is important to remember the behavioral finance missteps we are prone to make and the personal biases to which we are susceptible. A decision tree is only as good as its inputs, and static probabilities—those that haven’t been updated—have little value. It is only through the process of continually updating probabilities with objective information that the decision tree will work. Whether or not they recognize it, virtually all decisions investors make are exercises in probability. To succeed, it is critical that their probability statements combine the historical record with the most recent data available. That is Bayesian analysis in action. Eight years after Claude Shannon wrote “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” (Chapter 5), a young scientist at Bell Labs, James Larry Kelly Jr., took Shannon’s celebrated paper and distilled from its findings a new probability theory.9 Kelly worked alongside Shannon at Bell Labs and thus had a close look at Shannon’s mathematics. Inside Shannon’s paper was a mathematical formula for the optimal amount of information that, considering ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2857))

- the possibilities of success, can be pushed through copper wire. Kelly pointed out that Shannon’s various transmission rates and the possible outcomes of a chance event are essentially the same thing—probabilities—and the same formula could optimize both. He presented his ideas in a paper called “A New Interpretation of Information Rate.” Published in The Bell System Technical Journal in 1956, it opened a mathematical doorway that could help investors make portfolio decisions.10 The Kelly criterion, as applied to investing, is also known as the Kelly Optimization Model, which in turn is called the optimal growth strategy. It provides a way to determine, mathematically, the optimal size of a series of bets that would maximize the growth rate of a portfolio over time, and it’s based on the simple idea that if you know the probability of success, you bet the fraction of your bankroll that maximizes the growth rate. It is expressed as a formula: 2p − 1 = x; where 2 times the probability of winning minus 1 equals the percentage of one’s bankroll that should be bet. For example, if the probability of beating the house is 55 percent, you should bet 10 percent of your bankroll to achieve maximum growth of your winnings. If the probability is 70 percent, bet 40 percent. And if you know the odds of winning are 100 percent, the model would say, bet your entire bankroll.

- Ed Oakley Thorp, a mathematics professor, blackjack player, hedge fund manager, and author, was the pioneer in applying the Kelly criterion to gambling halls as well as to the stock market. Thorp worked at MIT from 1959 to 1961. There he met Claude Shannon and read Kelly’s paper. He immediately set forth to prove to himself whether or not the Kelly criterion would actually work. Thorp learned Fortran so he could program the university’s computer to run countless equations on the probabilities of winning at blackjack using the Kelly criterion. Thorp’s strategy was based on a simple concept. When the deck is rich with tens, face cards, and aces, the player has a statistical advantage over the dealer. If you assign a −1 for the high cards and +1 for the low cards, it’s quite easy to keep track of the cards dealt; just keep a running tally in your head, adding or subtracting as… ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2894))

- to modify the Kelly approach. Again, the solution is mathematical in the form of simple arithmetic. To avoid “gambler’s ruin,” you minimize the risk by underbetting—using a half-Kelly or fractional Kelly. For example, if the Kelly model were to tell you to bet 10 percent of your capital (reflecting a 55 percent probability of success), you might choose to invest only 5 percent (half-Kelly) or 2 percent (fractional Kelly). That underbet provides a margin of safety in portfolio management; and that, together with the margin of safety we apply to selecting individual stocks, provides a double layer of protection and a very real psychological level of comfort.

- At age 40, Stephen Jay Gould, the famous American paleontologist and evolutionary biologist, was diagnosed with abdominal mesothelioma, a rare and fatal form of cancer, and was rushed into surgery. After the operation Gould asked his doctor what he could read to learn more about the disease. She told him there was “not much to be learned from the literature.”12 Undeterred, Gould headed to Harvard’s Countway medical library and punched “mesothelioma” into the computer. After spending an hour reading a few of the latest articles, Gould understood why his doctor was not so forthcoming. The information was brutally straightforward: mesothelioma was incurable, with a median life expectancy of only eight months. Gould sat stunned until his mind began working again. Then he smiled. What exactly did an eight-month median mortality signify? The median, etymologically speaking, is the halfway point between a string of values. In any grouping, half the members of the group will be below the median and half above it. In Gould’s case, half of those diagnosed with mesothelioma would die in less than eight months and half would die sometime after eight months. (For the record, the other two measures of central tendency are mean and mode. Mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of cases—a simple average. Mode refers to the most common value. For ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2941))

- example, in the string of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7, 9, 12, the number 4 is the mode.) Most people look on averages as basic reality, giving little thought to the possible variances. Seen this way, “eight months’ median mortality” meant he would be dead in eight months. But Gould was an evolutionary biologist and evolutionary biologists live in a world of variation. What interests them is not the average of what happened but the variation in the system over time. To them, means and medians are abstractions. Most of us have a tendency to see the world along the bell shape curve with two equal sides, where mean, median, and mode are all the same value. But as we have learned, nature does not always fit so neatly along a normal, symmetrical distribution but sometimes skews asymmetrically to one side or the other. These distributions are called either right or left skewed depending on the direction of the elongation. Gould the biologist did not see himself as the average patient of all mesothelioma patients but as one individual inside a population set of mesothelioma patients. With further investigation, he discovered that the life expectancy of patients was strongly right skewed, meaning that those on the plus side of the eight-month mark lived significantly longer than eight months. What causes a distribution to skew either left or right? In a word, variation. As variation on one or the other side of the median ([Location 2952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2952))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- increases, the sides of the bell curve are pulled either right or left. Continuing with our example, in Gould’s case, those patients who lived past the eight-month mark showed high variance (many of them lived not just more months but years), and that pulled the curve to form a right skew. In a right-skewed distribution, the measures of central tendency do not coincide; the median lies to the right of the mode and the mean lies to the right of the median. Gould began to think about the characteristics of those patients who populated the right skew of the distribution, who exceeded the median distribution of life expectancy. Not surprisingly, they were young, generally in good health, and had benefited from early diagnosis. This was Gould’s own profile, and so he reasoned there was a good chance he would live well beyond the eight-month mark. Indeed, Gould lived for another twenty years. “Our culture encodes a strong bias either to neglect or ignore variation,” Gould said. “We tend to focus instead on measures of central tendency, and as a result we make some terrible mistakes, often with considerable practical import.”13 The most important lesson investors can learn from Gould’s experience is to appreciate the differences between the trend of the system and trends in the system. Put differently, investors need to understand the difference between the average return of the stock market and the performance variation of individual stocks. One of the easiest ways for investors to appreciate the differences is to study sideways markets. Most investors have experienced two types of stock markets—bull and bear—that go either up or down over time. But there is a third, less familiar type of market.… ([Location 2964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2964))

- the trailing price-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 was almost 12 times. By the fall of 1982, it had declined to nearly 7 times. Some stock market forecasters are drawing analogies to what happened then to what may be happening today. There are concerns about the rate of corporate profit growth against the backdrop of a weak global economic recovery. Others fear the massive stimulation provided by the monetary authorities will cause a rise in commodity prices, inflation, and decline in the dollar. This will, in turn, feed back into the stock market, causing price-earnings multiples to fall. Ultimately, investors could face a prolonged period when the market barely budges—and when they are best advised to avoid stocks. When I first heard that argument—that we might be facing a sideways market similar to the late 1970s and it was best to avoid stocks—I was puzzled. Was it really true that sideways markets are unprofitable for long-term investors? Warren Buffett, for one, had generated excellent returns during the period; so did his friend and Columbia University classmate Bill Ruane. From 1975 through 1982, Buffett generated a cumulative total return of 676 percent at Berkshire Hathaway; Ruane and his Sequoia Fund partner Rick Cunniff posted a 415 percent cumulative return. How did they manage these outstanding returns in a market that went nowhere? I decided to dig a little. First, I examined the return performance of the 500 largest stocks in the market between 1975 and 1982. I was specifically looking for stocks that had produced outsized gains for shareholders. Over the 8-year period, only 3 percent of the 500 stocks went up in price by at least 100 percent in any one year. When I extended the holding period to 3 years, the results were more encouraging: Over rolling 3-year periods, 18.6 percent of the stocks, on average, doubled. That equals 93 out of 500. Then I extended the holding period to 5 years. Here the returns were eye-popping. On average, an astonishing 38 percent of the stocks went up 100 percent or more; that’s 190 out of 500.14 Putting it in Gould’s terms, investors who observed the stock market between 1975 and 1982 and focused on the market average came to the wrong conclusion. They wrongly assumed that the direction of the market was sideways, when in fact the variation within the market was dramatic and led to plenty of opportunities to earn high excess returns. Gould tells us “the old Platonic strategy of abstracting the full house as a single figure (an average) and then tracing the pathway of this single figure through time, usually leads to error and confusion.” Because investors have a “strong desire to identify trends,” it ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=2983))

- often leads them “to detect a directionality that doesn’t exist.” As a result, they completely “misread the expanding or contracting variation within a system. “In Darwin’s world,” said Gould, “variation stands as the fundamental reality and calculated averages become abstractions.”15 ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00APDG114&location=3005))

Whenever you hear someone say, “It all averages out,” that’s a colloquial rendition of regression to the mean—a statistical phenomenon that, in essence, describes the tendency of unusually high or unusually low values to eventually drift back toward the middle.
