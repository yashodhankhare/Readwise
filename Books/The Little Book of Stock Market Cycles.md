- Humans are creatures of habit. Knowing the habits of your fellow traders and investors will make market events, once dismissed as chance, unfold before you with apparent outcomes. Even in today’s world of “high frequency” trading ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=230))
- and 4G smart phone communication, old-time daily regimens prevail and shape the intraday moments of the stock market in much the same manner as they have for decades. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=232))

- knowing how it performed in the past will give you an edge in future times of crisis. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=236))
- Market cycles and patterns do not repeat exactly what they have done in the past, but like the rest of the natural ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=246))
- phenomena in the universe, they surely rhyme. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=247))
- Always remember that stock market cycles are not exact, they are as much an art form as a science. Be contrary to the crowd. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=251))
- When ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=252))
- everyone is in agreement and dead sure a particular cycle, level, or future outcome is in play, the market will likely wobble off course and do what the least number of market participants expect. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=252))

- Let’s start with a couple of important definitions: secular and cyclical. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=278))
- Remember that these markets are run by imperfect human beings. Even though much trading is computer generated now, those computers and the software they run were designed and created by emotional creatures with needs, wants, desires, impatience, envy, vengeance, love, ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=283))

- The distinguished team at Ned Davis Research (NDR) classifies a bull market as a 30 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13 percent rise after 155 calendar days. Similarly a bear market requires a 30 percent drop in the ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=290))
- Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or 13 percent decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals of 30 percent in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=291))

- Most people who know something about the stock market have heard the phrase “Sell in May and go away.” It comes from an old British saw, “Sell in May and go away, come back on St. Leger day.” Established in 1776, the St. Leger Stakes is the last flat ([Location 2325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=2325))

- seasonality, it does coincide with the end of the worst months of the year for stocks. We have proven over the years that most of the markets gains occur in the six-month period from November to April. If you don’t buy in October or November what do you have to sell in May or better ([Location 2329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=2329))
- yet April? My Best Months Switching Strategy will not make you an instant millionaire as other strategies claim they can do. What it will do is steadily build wealth over time with half the risk (or less) of a buy-and-hold approach.

- So what’s an exponential moving average? A simple moving average is calculated by totaling the closing prices of a stock over a prescribed period (say, 30 days) and dividing that total by the number of days in the period (i.e., 30). ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=2374))
- The resulting number is the average. In order for the average to move, the most recent closing price is added to the previous total and the oldest closing price used in that total is subtracted. The new total is then divided by the number of days of the moving average, and the ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=2376))

- simple moving average approach is that it will allow an extreme high or extreme low to distort the true value of the stock, possibly giving false buy or sell signals or rapid whipsaws. To overcome the distortion caused by extreme highs or ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007OWRCHQ&location=2383))
- lows, the exponential moving average weights recent closing prices more heavily than earlier closing prices.
