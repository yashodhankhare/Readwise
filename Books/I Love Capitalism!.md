## Highlights
- My mother said to me one night, “You know, you’re going to be very successful.” I said, “How is that, Mom?” She said, “Because money skips generations. Your father’s father was very successful. Your father and his brothers did the best they could, but not much came of it. Now it’s your turn.” ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=358))

- When I say I had the most wonderful childhood in the world, I mean every word. My parents gave me the one thing that a kid needs more than everything else: unconditional love. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=388))

- Anyway, Joe helped me enormously. And there’s one very important point I want to make right at the beginning of this book: the thing I can’t say and never will say is that I’m self-made. I’m not. To say that would be an injustice to all those people who brought me to the party. I’m grateful to every one of them, and Joe Spector was one of them. He’s passed on, and I miss him. He was a good man. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=825))

- A meeting with Shorty Mahanna was a very high-level one, and I was nervous. And in the cab on the way uptown, Jack said to me, “Listen to me. You’re going to walk in there, and the first thing you’re going to do is tell Shorty all the negatives—all the reasons why he shouldn’t buy Harbison-Walker Refractories. What’s wrong, what could go wrong, what needs to be fixed but can’t be fixed.” “What the hell are you talking about?” I said. “I’m ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=1173))

- going up there to tell him to buy it.” Jack looked me in the eye. “You just remember,” he said. “Give him all the negatives first.” “Why am I doing this?” I asked. “You just do it, and I’ll tell you after we leave.” “Okay,” I thought. “This is my boss. I’m not going to screw around.” We got to GE and were shown into Mahanna’s office. I was immediately intimidated: the only thing on his desk was a telephone. And when he stood to greet us, he really was short! We sat down. And I said, “Mr. Mahanna, I’m here to sell you on a stock, but let me tell you all the reasons why you shouldn’t buy it.” “What do you mean?” he said.

- “Well,” I said, “nothing is perfect.” And I proceeded to go through a list of every downside to Harbison-Walker. The company had a very limited product line, I told him, and faced strong competition in a limited market. A recession could impact it badly. And there were a couple of problems with its current management. Mahanna looked thoughtful. “Now,” I said. “Let me tell you why I like it.” I said that because the economy was picking up, demand for steel looked like it was going to take off. I told him that Harbison-Walker was the Cadillac of the industry; everybody respected the quality of what they did, and they were also the ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=1182))

- lowest-cost producer of their product. And the company was based in Pittsburgh and had deep and strong relationships in the steel industry. “Well,” he finally said, “do you like it more than you don’t like it?” “Yeah, a whole lot more,” I said. “I think this is a great stock.” “Okay,” he said. “Let me think about it.” And Jack and I left. In the cab downtown, I said, “Jack, why did I just do that?” “I’m going to tell you why you did it. This afternoon he’s going to call up all of his buddies on Wall Street, and he’s going to ask them, ‘What do you think of Harbison-Walker Refractories?’ He’s going to have a checklist on that nice clean desk of his.

- And if his pals tell him anything negative about the company, he’s going to tick off the list. He’ll say, ‘Well, Ken told me that, Ken told me that, Ken told me that.’ Your trust is going to go through the roof with him.” And sure enough, that’s exactly how it happened. Shorty Mahanna bought Harbison-Walker through me, and then he bought a lot more. Lesson learned. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=1192))

- The first big lesson Bindy taught me was one he taught by example. I’d begun encountering some of the big, big guys on Wall Street, legendary guys, men I’d read about in Fortune. These men were gods to me, and I saw right away that Bindy simply wasn’t in awe of them. In short order, he taught me to understand that a man’s public persona usually has very little to do with his private persona. Without that lesson, I would have felt subservient toward these muckety-mucks, but with that lesson under my belt I felt completely equal to anyone I dealt with.

- So everybody—the bond guys, the stock guys—did what they had to do. But the guy who ran the stock desk came to me and said, “Ken, I’ve got a kid working for us. I told him we’ve got to terminate him because we can’t afford him; nothing to do with his performance. In fact, I told him we thought he had a great future in ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=1785))

And Alan Schwartz says to me, “I understand what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, but I don’t want to leave. I’m learning so much here.” “I’m sorry, Alan,” I said. “We just can’t afford to pay you anymore.” “Can you afford minimum wage?” he asked. Minimum wage in 1970 was $1.45 an hour. “You can’t afford to live on that,” I said. “That’s my problem, not yours,” he said. My problem, not yours—those had been my exact words to Jack Cullen when I convinced him Pressprich should hire me for ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=1787))

And Alan Schwartz (he was single at the time) got a job there as a busboy and waiter at night so he could stay at Pressprich. He turned out to be one of the most talented and able men I’ve ever known in this business: he went on to become CEO of Bear Stearns and is now executive chairman of Guggenheim Partners.

Do you think it doesn’t give me a little glow every time I see “NYU Langone” here, there, and everywhere?

My driver, Alvaro, was taking me down to Mass at St. Pat’s the other morning. Alvaro has been working for me for twenty-six years, and he’s done very well. Dresses like a banker. People compliment me about him all the time. “What an amazing driver you have,” they say. I say, “Guess what? Alvaro is on the team, and he knows it.” Alvaro has bought and sold two apartments in Florida and made enough that he now owns an apartment on the sixteenth floor of a high-rise on Singer Island.

To me, that’s what capitalism should be all about. As we were heading downtown, I said, “You know, Alvaro, I’m really lucky to have had you with me all these years.” “Well, I’m lucky to work for you,” he said. And then: “There’s nobody like you, Mr. Langone.” “Well, there’s nobody like you, Alvaro,” I said. And I meant every word.

So even though some people around me seemed excited about how rich I was, I thought, “I ain’t counting.” I’m still not. I’m not counting until I leave the table, and I’m not leaving the table until I have to. Still, my success has given me all kinds of freedom I didn’t have before.

What happened? Mostly good ideas poorly executed. They couldn’t compete. Capitalism is brutal, but it’s rarely a zero-sum game. Both sides of any transaction should get something out of the deal.

And he told me. “Fine,” I said. “Now do we have a deal?” “We sure do,” he said. “Memorialize it,” I said. “Get your lawyers; I’ll get my lawyers. You got your deal.

Back in the 1960s and early 1970s, there was a group of large-cap stocks called the Nifty Fifty. Anheuser-Busch. Black & Decker. Bristol-Myers. The Coca-Cola Company. Dow Chemical. Eastman Kodak. Eli Lilly. General Electric. IBM. Johnson & Johnson. 3M. Xerox.

Kodak was a money machine: they made so damn much on those little yellow film boxes. Then one day an engineer walks into their R&D department and says, “Hey, look what I can do. I can take a picture digitally.” “What happens?” the R&D guy asks. “Well, it goes through the electronics, and it comes up on a screen,” the engineer… ([Location 3693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3693))

- “No, you don’t use film. If you want to print it out on a piece of paper, you can, but this is just digital—nothing but pixels.” You know what happened next. Kodak was reluctant to give up the cash cow it had in film, the kids out in Silicon Valley figured digital photography out for themselves, and Kodak was gone. Xerox. In 1959, Xerox’s stock used to literally double every six months. They had what they called the 914 machine, the original dry print. Then the patents ran out, and all of a sudden Minolta and all the rest of them show up with the same technology. Xerox is a shadow of its former self today. What a tech company needs to do during the precious period when it has product exclusivity is spend a lot of money to obsolete itself. That’s what IBM used to be the best at, but it lost its way through sheer arrogance. IBM stopped obsoleting itself, and other people obsoleted it. IBM thought it could keep producing hardware when the rest of the world—Cisco, Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft—went to software. Especially Microsoft. IBM gave Bill Gates that… ([Location 3699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3699))

- The Nifty Fifty dwindled down to Not So Nifty through arrogance, rigidity, myopia. Companies lose their way the same way people do—and with people at the top who lack vision. IBM focused on the wrong things. Avon is gone. Procter & Gamble has leaned itself way down: they’ve shed product lines right and left. Now they’re looking for inspiration to GE, which Jeff Immelt, before he retired, began trying to recast as the industrial software company of the future. Good luck on that one. That’s like trying to get an ocean liner to do a 180. The one company on that list that’s morphed really successfully is Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing—3M. They’ve made significant investments in new technologies, in new products. They have an abiding belief that they must bring out so many new products every single year. Just think of how much money they made on Post-it notes alone! 3M has been magnificent in innovation. ([Location 3713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3713))

So Pam made the appointment, and the guy came in and sat down across from me ([Location 3782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3782))

- in my office. I’ll call him Phil Morelli. Phil told me he started with us about nineteen years ago as an hourly associate, at a couple of bucks an hour more than minimum wage. He was a lot boy—helping people load their carts and pushing the carts back in from the parking lot. Today he’s a district manager, in charge of eight stores; he makes about $250,000 a year. “But I’ll tell you why I had to come see you today,” he said. He looked at me. “I want you to know, last spring, I paid off my parents’ mortgage. In December, I paid mine off. And yesterday afternoon I got a call from my Merrill Lynch broker telling me that my account is now worth over a million dollars, so I’m a ([Location 3783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3783))

- millionaire.” This is a kid who couldn’t afford to go to college. Maybe he wasn’t college material. Doesn’t matter—today he’s a millionaire. And he’s not alone. We’ve got three thousand people at Home Depot who started out as hourly employees and are multimillionaires today. When capitalism works the way it should, it works for everybody. It’s like the tide: all boats get lifted. Do I expect credit? I don’t need credit; I’ve done very well. But beyond that, I got a huge sense of satisfaction. Here I am, a guy who flew around the… ([Location 3788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3788))

- who’d just filed for business and personal bankruptcy, and when I finally put the money together, I went to them and said, “Let’s start a company.” We started a company, and bang, here’s Home Depot. Which, by my calculation, has impacted at least a million and a half lives. How do I figure that? Home Depot has 400,000 employees across twenty-three hundred stores. The majority of those employees have wives, husbands, kids to feed. Then think of the number of jobs we’ve created at the companies that make the goods… ([Location 3793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3793))

- those 400,000 employees, 200,000 of them were working in hardware stores that we wiped out, so that’s not really a net gain. And there is some merit to that argument. But those 200,000 weren’t being paid like we pay them, and they weren’t being taken care of like we take care of them, and they weren’t getting benefits like those we give them. For example, we’ve never paid anybody minimum wage at Home Depot. We had a simple belief: minimum wage, minimum talent. We always wanted to have good kids who… ([Location 3798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3798))

- them every six months. And from the beginning we were growing like a weed, so we created enormous upside mobility. Income inequality is a terrible problem in this country, and I don’t have a magic solution. I don’t know about mandating a higher minimum wage. I do know that nobody can live on $20,000 a year. But I worry that mandating a higher minimum might hurt the people you want to try to help: the more you increase the costs of any factor of production, the more incentive you give owners to figure out a way to change that factor of production… ([Location 3803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076GMVSF1&location=3803))

- wealthy like to brag about being self-made men. I can’t imagine they’re not leaving somebody out of that equation. The thing I can’t say and never will say is that I’m self-made. To make that claim would be to commit a grave sin against all the many, many people who helped me get to where I am; you could fill Yankee Stadium with them, and then some.

- I could pass along to kids today, it’s this: the opportunities in America today are the very best they’ve ever been. You might have to look harder for them than in my day, but they’re there. Boy, do I wish I were twenty-one again and just starting out. On the other hand, I have to admit that when I was twenty-one, I was looking at the world one-eyed. Like so many college kids today, I wanted to go to Wall Street and get rich. That’s a good way to make a lot of money; it’s also a way to fail big. Not to mention burn out fast. I learned early how essential it was to love the work I was doing. Sometimes I look back and wonder, how did all this happen?

- comes. Shit, I know how it happened: I was at a place where I was having the time of my life! I still remember what Hudson Whitenight said to me sixty years ago: “If you really love your work as much as I think you’re going to, you’re going to be a big success.” So I’m saying to a kid, I learned that ex post facto; you should learn it in front! Yes, I’ve been lucky, incredibly lucky, and you can’t learn good luck. My old man used to say to me, “You could fall in a bucket of shit and come up with a gold watch and chain.” But we all fall in that bucket from time to time. What distinguishes the winners from the losers is the ability to turn adversity around: resilience and creativity.
