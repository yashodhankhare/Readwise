## Highlights
- The key, as the authors illustrate with their marvelous collection of case studies, is to develop two practices. First, systematically build pockets of solitude into your life. We all have no more than twenty-four hours in a day, and they will be chewed up unless you deliberately structure time for solitude, inserting some “white space” in your calendar. White space does not mean vacation; it simply means nothing scheduled. Think of it as like putting down rocks in the river; if you wait for the river to stop flowing before you walk out and put a rock down, you’ll never get one out there. Instead, better to drop a rock in the flow and make the river go around it. This is the idea of white space, time scheduled with yourself, honored as you would any other vital appointment. The second discipline is to recognize unexpected opportunities for solitude and seize them. It might come in the form of an unexpected life change that pulls you out of the fray, or it might come in a more pedestrian form. What do you do when stuck in traffic or with an unexpected flight delay? What do you do when you’ve been gifted an unexpected twenty minutes before a meeting? What do you do when you wake up earlier than others in the morning or find yourself awake late at night? Do you capture the opportunity for quiet solitude, or do you run from it?

- To lead others, you must first lead yourself. That, ultimately, is the theme of this book. Leadership, as Dwight Eisenhower defined it, is “the art of getting someone else to do something that you want done because he wants to do it.” ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=275))

- To develop that clarity and conviction of purpose, and the moral courage to sustain it through adversity, requires something that one might not associate with leadership. That something is solitude. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=280))

- It is, simply, a subjective state of mind, in which the mind, isolated from input from other minds, works through a problem on its own. That isolation can be sustained, as it was for Thoreau or is for a long-distance runner. Or it can be intermittent, as it might be for a person who reads a book—which of course is a collection of someone else’s thoughts—and then pauses occasionally to think through ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=284))

- For solitude in this sense—the leadership sense—is hard work. Not the phony work of a clattering keyboard in response to an e-mailed lunch invitation, or a furrowed brow while surfing the Net. Instead, leadership solitude is productive solitude, which means to use solitude purposely, with a particular end in mind. Productive solitude involves working your mind—not passively, but actively, as you would a large muscle—as you break down and sort and synthesize what is already there. When that process of work and isolation is successful—and when done honestly, it usually is—the result is an insight, or even a broader vision, that brings mind and soul together in clear-eyed, inspired conviction. And that kind of conviction is the foundation of leadership. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=288))

- Another problem concerns not the means by which we communicate today, but the manner. It is commonplace now to yell rather than speak, to talk over each other rather than listen, to answer criticism without pausing to consider whether it has merit.

- From there both climbers surged upward with new energy. “Without the phone, I was able to sit and contemplate,” he says. “Each day there are only a handful of hours that are good for climbing. When I wasn’t climbing, I sat there looking out at the mountains from two thousand feet up. Reflecting on what the climb meant. Solitude is such a powerful force. It’s spiritual to me.” ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=670))

- Intuition and analytical clarity both involve processing information, but with intuition the processing is already done for you. The challenge with intuition is to access it. Usually our minds are caught up in a cycle of stimulus and response, sometimes about things worth thinking about, other times about trivialities. This cycle creates a mental dialogue of its own, which during times of constant inputs or stress is more like a din. So long as the dialogue continues, our attention is consumed by it. Intuition, by contrast, forms beneath the surface of conscious thought. Intuition (or instinct, as it is sometimes called) is not focused solely on what one is experiencing now, but instead draws upon all of one’s experiences, past and present. Intuition makes connections between all those experiences. Frequently those connections are based on patterns: when one has perceived certain things in the past, certain other things were also present, or soon followed. That a person glances to the side as he speaks, for example, might give rise to an intuition that he is lying—for one has encountered that sort of side-glance before. That a longtime city-dweller perceives another person following her on a city street, at a certain distance and with a certain gait, might give rise to an intuition of danger. And that a senior executive’s office walls are covered with photographs of himself and various celebrities might give rise, to a middle manager meeting him for the first time, to an intuition that the executive is susceptible to flattery. The mechanics of intuition and analytical thinking are opposites of one another. Analysis requires focus, which is to say that one’s attention is concentrated on a single point. But intuition works best from a panoramic view, where one takes in all the surrounding circumstances—including details, like office décor, that at first might seem irrelevant. For those details give rise to patterns, which, when processed by the subconscious mind, give rise to intuition. Intuition’s critics are mistaken, therefore, to say that it is unreasoned. Reasoning based on patterns is a form of inductive reasoning (i.e., reasoning “from many specific observations to a general principle”; for example, that senior executives who cover their office walls with photos of themselves are generally narcissists), which in the case of intuition takes place subconsciously. (Analytical thinking is more commonly deductive, i.e., reasoning “from a general principle to a specific conclusion.”) And because intuition is based on more information—in many cases vastly more—than analysis is, intuition provides an important check on analytical thinking. A particular analysis might be entirely coherent and yet entirely wrong—because it assumes a nonexistent fact or overlooks an existing one. Intuition will often catch the mistake. Of course, subconscious inductive reasoning based on circumstances one has encountered earlier in life has its limits, and thus so… ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=957))

- “The first step on the road to experiencing true awareness,” she wrote, “is the cessation of noise from within.” In the stillness of intuition, and with “aloneness” now “a way of life,” Jane found herself “getting closer to animals and nature, and as a result, getting closer to myself and more and more in tune with the spiritual power I felt all around.” She perceived with new clarity the forest world around her. “The feel of rough sun-warmed bark of an ancient forest giant, or the cool, smooth skin of a young and eager sapling, gave me a ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1079))

- strange, intuitive sense of the sap as it was sucked up by unseen roots and drawn up to the very tips of the branches.” Her perceptions became even clearer when she focused simply on perceiving them. “Words are part of our rational selves, and to abandon them for a while is to give freer rein to our intuitive selves.” Thus, she wrote, “it is all but impossible to describe the new awareness that comes when words are abandoned.” ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1083))

- That awareness for Goodall was often spiritual. “No words of mine could ever convey, even in part, the almost mystical awareness of beauty and eternity that accompanies certain treasured moments.” In Through a Window, she describes one such moment after a rainstorm in the forest: The air was filled with a feathered symphony, the evensong of birds. I heard new frequencies in their music and, too, in the singing of insect voices, notes so high and sweet that I was amazed. I was intensely aware of the shape, the colour, of individual leaves, the varied patterns of the veins that made each one unique. Scents were clear, easily identifiable—fermenting, over-ripe fruit; water-logged earth; cold, wet bark; the damp odour of chimpanzee hair, and, yes, my own too. And the aromatic scent of young, crushed leaves was almost overpowering. I sensed the presence of a bushbuck, then saw him, quietly browsing upwind, his spiraled horns dark with rain. And I was utterly filled with that peace “which passeth all understanding.” In moments like these—moments she could experience only in absolute solitude—Goodall came to realize that, even as a human being, she was… ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1087))

- Although Marie Curie conducted much of her research jointly with her husband, Pierre, one of her most far-reaching discoveries came while working alone. In March 1897, in Paris, she began research for a doctorate in science, something no woman in Europe had obtained before. The year before, another scientist working in France, Henri Becquerel, had wrapped several photographic plates in black cloth and covered them with a sheet of aluminum, on top of which he placed some crystals containing uranium. Then he placed the whole package in a drawer and closed the door. Removing the plates several days later, he was astounded to find that they were intensely fogged where the crystals had lain above them. Becquerel’s discovery was that uranium salts emit rays that—like X-rays, which had been discovered in late 1895—penetrate matter. Now Marie Curie sought to answer a question raised by Becquerel’s discovery: from where did the uranium compound get the energy that darkened the plates? Working in a small room with borrowed instruments and scavenged mineral samples, Curie put different substances on a metal plate and then measured the energy—in the form of electric current—that passed between the substance on the plate… ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1105))

- to the amount of energy emitted. And Curie’s compounds appeared completely unchanged as they emitted their electrical current. The results seemed to violate the first law of thermodynamics: that energy can be converted from one form to another—as with an ordinary chemical reaction that gives off heat or light—but cannot be created or destroyed. What Curie had discovered was that the energy emitted by uranium came not from any chemical reaction but from the uranium atom itself. This new form of energy Marie Curie called “… ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1116))

- As with clarity, there is an intuitive path to creativity, on which much of the work is already done for the leader, if only he will pause to listen.

- Chip went on to attend Yale Divinity School, from which he holds a master’s degree. While he was there, he had an existential crisis. “I wasn’t using my time well, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life.” One day a friend invited Chip to a prayer service at five thirty A.M. the next day. Chip walked across a snowy campus that dark morning to a small stone chapel. “I figured there would be people praying aloud, that sort of thing. But there weren’t. People were sitting there in candlelight, in stone silence.” At first it was uncomfortable. “Sitting there in silence, I discovered how noisy my world was. Thoughts and emotions were constantly running through me.” Chip likens his frame of mind then to a story about a Burmese monk. “One day a man came to the monk for advice. He started talking about all the problems in his life. The monk started pouring a cup of tea. The man kept talking, the monk kept pouring. The tea overflowed out of the cup, onto the table, onto the ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1291))

- “Viktor Frankl wrote about how between every stimulus and response, there is a space. Silence and solitude creates a sacred space, an elongated space. The space gives you time to develop a creative response to what you’re feeling.

- Chip has refined his practice to include journaling. “I do journaling every single day,” he says. His process itself is creative. “I have a stream of consciousness in my mind, thought streams. That gets a process going in my brain, which has an effect somewhere in my body or soul. It has a power over you. So the first thing I do is write down my thought streams. I name what I’m feeling. Then I engage it. I’m not judging it. I’m trying to understand it, why I’m feeling this way. Then I ask whether this feeling is something I want to bring back to my relationships. Anger and anxiety are not going to be part of a creative solution. Then I construct a response based on my values rather than on these feelings. And then I engage others with that response. It’s a process of personal leadership.” ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1306))

- Yet Chip had stopped his practice of silence and solitude during this period. “That was one of the first things to go out the window when I started hyperfunctioning,” Chip says. “Finally I went to see one of the monks I knew from my seminary days. He told me, ‘Nothing can happen through you, until it happens inside you.’ He told me to reconnect with silence and solitude.” Chip began his practice again. “Silence and solitude is most important in times like these. You need creativity. When you’re being chased by a bear, it’s hard to stop and invent the wheel, to find a better way to solve the problem. But you need to turn around and look at the bear—because it might not be a bear.” ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1322))

- Intuition can give rise to not only clarity but creativity. For intuition can make connections not only between certain facts that usually come bundled together, but also between things that at first seem unrelated or even antagonistic. The fall of an apple, to cite a famous example from history, might seem to have nothing to do with astrophysics; but from such a fall, Sir Isaac Newton intuited an idea—the law of gravity—by which he explained the movement of planets in their orbits. (It seems no coincidence that Newton was resting quietly under a tree at the time.) And in the medical field, researchers have used various kinds of snake and spider venom—which normally bring certain bodily processes to a halt—to create medicines that slow those processes (cell growth or circulation, for example) when they spiral out of control. Intuition, in these instances, unlocks creativity by making connections no one has made before. Intuition can also serve creativity in another way. Just as intuition can alert us that circumstances fit a certain pattern, so too it can alert us that a pattern that should be present is not. A simple example is that, if we encounter absolute stillness upon entering a room where normally ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1354))

- there is a hum of background noise, we know that something is wrong. More to the point, conventional thinking rests on certain assumptions, namely that certain facts exist. Those facts themselves form a pattern; and based on those assumed facts, certain rules of decision follow. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1363))

- Excess emotion—emotion beyond a leader’s own limits to control—has to go somewhere. A leader can bottle up the emotion for a while, as Ulysses S. Grant sometimes did. But the leader who thinks he can cram it down indefinitely is only deluding himself; the emotion will either distort his judgment or eventually paralyze him altogether, as it did Hooker.

- A more effective leader is honest with himself about the source of his excess emotion and about the need to dissipate it in a benign way. He will, of course, be careful about doing that publicly: in a crisis his subordinates are likely to be emotional too, and the sight of their leader’s fear may act as an accelerant to their own. Or they might lose faith in a leader who appears overmatched by events. The solution, then, is to do what successful leaders have done in crises throughout history: make a choice to go somewhere and break down in private. Productive solitude, in this instance, is simply a pressure-relief valve for leaders who are willing to acknowledge their own limitations. But in these situations productive solitude can do more than that for a leader. In leadership, as in other areas of life, one’s anxiety about an event is sometimes out of proportion to the event itself. When adversity is viewed close-up, as it breaks ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1784))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- upon the scene, it often seems larger and more overwhelming than it truly is. In those moments neither the leader nor anyone else can see past it. When adversity fills the windshield, it is time to change one’s perspective. Productive solitude allows a leader to make that change. By removing herself from the clamor around her, the leader can step outside events, to see them in a larger context—and thereby see their limitations. By cutting the problem down to size intellectually, the leader does the same thing emotionally. Then she can shift her focus away from fear and recrimination, and toward the real tasks of positive leadership: action, goals, and the preparation of plans to meet them. The point reaches back to the first sentence of the introduction to this book: to lead others, you must first lead yourself. The leader who encounters a serious crisis and successfully manages his emotional balance throughout it does precisely that.

- Cleaning up the wreckage after a storm is one thing; living through the storm as it happens, with its fury still a living force and its damage still uncertain, is another. Leadership during a crisis presents different challenges than leadership after its consequences have already arrived. During a crisis, a leader faces not distress about what has already happened, but fear about what might. Much of that fear will be his own, but even more will be around him, in his subordinates, some of whom might urge the leader to be more fearful than he already is. The leader will also feel the shocks and jolts of the crisis itself as it unfolds; and as he navigates his way through it, the weight of his responsibility will feel heavier than at any other time. Moments like these are among the loneliest for a leader. Yet they are also the most difficult in which to find solitude. When a gale strikes, a leader’s place is not belowdecks, but at the helm. He should strive to maintain a measure of detachment, both from the emotion of others around him and from the crisis itself, observing it clinically, dispassionately. And he must focus his thinking strictly on the decisions he needs to make, rather than on the consequences that might follow if his decisions are wrong. This detachment and focus will afford him as much isolation as circumstances allow, and they will make him ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1898))

- resistant to the emotional tumult around him. From there, the leader must draw upon his inner strength. Every crisis must eventually come to an end. And even a leader who maintains her emotional balance throughout a crisis is likely to pay a price for doing so. Where previously she had reserves of strength, now she has a mass of unresolved tension built up during the course of the crisis. Left unresolved, the tension will make her first priority simply to avoid going through anything like that again. That sentiment is healthy to the extent the crisis should have been avoided in the first place. But crises are a part of leadership, and a leader who seeks always to avoid them will distort her judgment in doing so. Hence the leader must release the tension; and that means she must find solitude. ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=1908))

- Anger can distort a leader’s judgment as much as fear can. Indeed for leaders, as for anyone else, fear converts into anger quite easily. The stress and strain of leadership—the fear that one is nearly, if not actually, overmatched by one’s responsibilities—are emotional tinder for the leader who encounters adversity he does not expect. The adversity might give rise to a spark of irritation, as for a leader whose subordinates sometimes make the same mistake twice, or fail to anticipate something the leader is rather obviously going to need, or are careless in a way that adds to the leader’s burdens unnecessarily. Or the adversity might bring a fire of its own, as when some crisis erupts unexpectedly or the leader personally is subjected to serious injustice. Leadership, like fertilizer, contains elements that can be volatile or nurturing, depending on how one handles them. An unreflective leader is prone to volatility: he does not realize that his own anxieties are part of the fuel for his anger about some external event, and thus his response—berating employees, torching a meeting—is disproportionate to the event itself. A leader of this type finds himself apologizing frequently if he is decent, or embittering his followers if he is not. A more reflective leader can see these same events in a more constructive way. She will pause ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2111))

- before reacting to adversity, because she knows she might overreact if she does not. And she will reflect on what caused the adversity in the first place. Subordinates make mistakes like everyone else, and in her day the leader might have made mistakes that were even worse. Rather than lash out whenever she has the chance, she will forgive the trespasses of others, as others have forgiven hers. And she will help her followers to learn from their mistakes—by describing the mistakes clearly and matter-of-factly, by explaining how to avoid them in the future, and then, if the occasion allows, by reassuring the person that the leader herself has made that kind of mistake too. Such is the difference between leading one’s followers and scalding them while blowing off steam. Reflection can also help the leader manage her response to injustice directed at her personally. Political-operator types might scheme to get ahead of her for a promotion; empire-builders might seek to arrogate power that is rightfully hers; a colleague to whom she was generous when that person was vulnerable might, when the tables are turned, treat her with spite. The leader might or might not need to defend herself against such actions, but how she reacts to them emotionally is another matter. Rather than let such actions upset her own emotional balance, she can reflect on the reasons that drove the person to them—fear, narcissism, or simply that the person is miserable in general. And having reflected on those reasons, the leader will take the action less personally, because those reasons are usually not about her. Indeed, she will often feel a degree of sympathy for the person: people who are miserable often have reasons to be, though perhaps they could have handled them better. Where otherwise one might feel anger, reflection helps to bring peace. ([Location 2121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2121))

- “I will begin, therefore, by saying the most unpopular and most unwelcome thing.” —WINSTON CHURCHILL, OCTOBER 5, 1938 To have moral courage, a leader must be willing to sacrifice. Sometimes the sacrifices are modest: a diminished reputation in some quarters, questions about one’s priorities in others, awkwardness in relations that before were agreeable. Other times the sacrifices are more serious: ostracism where once there was popularity, widespread anger among certain groups, criticism of not only one’s judgment but one’s character. Still other times the sacrifices are severe: the loss of a job, severance of important relationships, threats of physical harm. Consequences like these—even the modest ones—will turn many people away from doing what they know is right. Yet there are times when such consequences are worth bearing, because the alternatives—misplaced priorities, harm to the organization, compromised integrity—are worse. A leader connected with her first principles can recognize those times and thus see that the stakes are larger than popularity or relationships or career success. A reflective leader will also realize she is not alone in her struggles. The leader might compare her situation to that of a past leader who faced equal or more difficult challenges, and then seek ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2459))

- to emulate that leader. Or she might recall the example of an admired relative or friend, or of a person who suffers from disability or hardship the likes of which the leader herself has never had to face. These sources can fuse mind and soul together into a determination that transcends whatever the critics might say.

- Churchill’s solitude was central to the Munich speech itself. The process of writing a complex document—for most writers, the most solitary of tasks—forces one to think much harder about its subject than does editing a document written by someone else. Churchill’s Munich speech reflects ([Location 2585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2585))

- this kind of clarity throughout, describing in crisp, lucid detail the calamity visited upon the Western democracies as a result of the agreement, the straightforward manner in which the calamity could have been avoided, and the consequences likely to follow. Regarding those consequences, Churchill predicted: “I venture to think that in the future the Czechoslovak state cannot be maintained as an independent entity. I think you will find that in a period of time which may be measured by years, but may be measured only by months, Czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the Nazi regime.” His prediction was prophecy: Hitler’s panzers rolled into Prague less than six months later, on March 15, 1939. That night Hitler declared: “Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.” Just as the process of writing makes one think more deeply, so too can it make the writer feel more deeply. That was certainly true for Churchill. Again Manchester describes it best: “Frequently, as he dictates passages which will stir his listeners, he weeps; his voice becomes thick with emotion, tears run down his cheeks (and his secretary’s).” Churchill’s Munich speech was surely one of those speeches. The papers Churchill used in preparation of his speech include a memorandum dated October 1, in which he underscored the following passage: “… nothing can detract from the courage and dignity [the Czechs] have displayed during the past three months.” This sentiment found timeless expression in the speech itself: “All is over. Silent, mournful, abandoned, broken, Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness.” And Churchill expressed the injustice in human terms: “This particular block of land, this mass of human beings to be handed over, has never expressed the desire to go into Nazi rule.” ([Location 2587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2587))

- They should know that there has been gross neglect and deficiency in our defences; they should know that we have sustained a defeat without a war, the consequences of which will travel far with us along our road; they should know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history, when the whole equilibrium of Europe has been deranged, and that the terrible words have for the time being been pronounced against the Western democracies: “Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting.” And do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless, by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.

- There are sources of moral courage that lie latent within us. The source might be one’s bond with a friend or mentor to whom one has not spoken in years—but still could call upon now. It might be an important life event whose implications one has not fully explored. It might be a relationship with a respected colleague, which, if one merely asked, could be a source of strength. When clarity about the reasons for his actions is no longer enough to sustain a leader, he can seek out these sources. What he seeks, usually, is not still more clarity about the reasons for his actions, but simply reassurance—reassurance that what he is doing is right, that he is doing his best, that he is a good person notwithstanding what the moral critics say. To sustain moral courage, a leader must tend to the soul as well as the mind. He can seek sources of reassurance by quiet reflection upon his life as a whole—the relationships that have been important to him, the things he would have done differently, the experiences that affected him most. (The second movement of Beethoven’s Emperor concerto captures the mood of this kind of reflection.) In that quietude, and with that broader perspective, an intuition will often surface about where he can find reassurance. Martin Luther King Jr. had the utmost clarity about the reasons for his actions as leader of the ([Location 2631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2631))

- Montgomery bus boycott of 1955–56, though that role came to him unsought. And yet after two months, worn down by moral criticism and an increasing flow of hostile phone calls and death threats, King contemplated abandoning his leadership role altogether. But late one night in January 1956, when he was ready to give up, King sat down at his kitchen table and reflected on his life. Then he realized there was one relationship he could draw upon more deeply—his relationship with God, which even as a pastor he had not yet fully developed. After King stood up from that table, his courage would never leave him again. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2641))

- At that point King realized that he needed to draw more deeply on his faith than ever before: And I discovered then that religion had become real to me, and I had to know God for myself.

- we represent is right. But Lord, I must confess that I’m weak now. I’m faltering. I’m losing my courage. And I can’t let the people see me like this because if they see me weak and losing my courage, they will begin to get weak.” Then King received his answer: And it seemed at that moment that I could hear an inner voice saying to me, “Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness. Stand up for justice. Stand up for truth. And lo I will be with you, even until the end of the world” … I heard the voice of Jesus saying still to fight on. He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone. No never alone. No never alone. He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone.

- “The real danger to both sides—for the Church and the other side, call it what you will—is the man who does not … listen to his deepest convictions, to his inner truth, but who wants only to fit, to float in conformity … The future of Poland will depend on how many people are mature enough to be nonconformist.” —POPE JOHN PAUL II, JUNE 1979 In times of shared sacrifice, a leader must inspire moral courage in his followers as well as in himself. In such times the leader’s responsibilities are especially great, for a leader’s first obligation is to take care of his people. If he cannot provide for them in material ways, he must provide for their spirit. To do so requires humility: although the leader has more power than his followers, he must recognize that as to the things that govern human worth—dignity, character, decency—his station counts for nothing. He must hold the conviction that, as to these things, he is not above his followers, but among them. For only then can he speak to these things in ways that inspire his followers. Yet for many leaders humility is difficult to come by. Like most people, leaders are prone to self-admiration. And a leader might hear every day—sometimes directly, sometimes in ways more oblique—that his ideas are insightful, his jokes funny, even that he is virtuous. Sometimes the praise is sincere, sometimes not; but in either case the leader who takes it seriously will allow ([Location 2837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y1K2G5N&location=2837))

- himself to be convinced, though he might not say it aloud, that his admirers indeed have a point. And then he will begin to set himself above his followers. Honest reflection can deflate these pretensions. A leader who is connected with her first principles can reflect on the ways she has fallen short of meeting them. And she can reflect on the ways that many of the people she encounters in daily life—the people who work for her, especially in more modest positions: the waiter who does his work cheerfully, even though the people he serves are not always cheerful in return; the maid who cleaned her hotel room that morning, and who gets up early each morning to clean other rooms all day—are at least her equals as measured by those same principles. A leader who demonstrates this kind of respect for her followers can speak to them with credibility about their common values. She will also have a deeper understanding of what those common values mean. And thus she can inspire them. Such were the practices of Pope John Paul II, as he inspired his people to resist the oppressions of communism.

- What made Wojtyla so dangerous was the genuinely profound thought that he had given to the premises underlying the regime. Wojtyla made a point to set aside time for that kind of thinking in his daily routine. As archbishop, every morning after Mass and then breakfast, Wojtyla closed the door behind him in his chapel and spent two hours thinking and writing at a small desk alone. During those hours, “writing in the solitude of his chapel,” Wojtyla produced “numerous philosophical essays and three books, as well as a stream of pastoral letters, sermons, poems, and a play.” And from those works, and the thinking that lay behind them, Wojtyla developed a thorough critique that would ultimately break apart the foundations of the communist regime.
