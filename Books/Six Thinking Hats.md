## Highlights
- The Six Hats Method Thinking is the ultimate human resource. Yet we can never be satisfied with our most important skill. No matter how good we become, we should always want to be better. Usually, the only people who are very satisfied with their thinking skill are those poor thinkers who believe that the purpose of thinking is to prove yourself right – to your own satisfaction. If we have only a limited view of what thinking can do, we may be smug about our excellence in this area, but not otherwise. The main difficulty of thinking is confusion. We try to do too much at once. Emotions, information, logic, hope and creativity all crowd in on us. It is like juggling with too many balls. What I am putting forward in this book is a very simple concept which allows a thinker to do one thing at a time. He or she becomes able to separate emotion from logic, creativity from information, and so on. The concept is that of the six thinking hats. Putting on any one of these hats defines a certain type of thinking. In the book I describe the nature and contribution of each type of thinking. The six thinking hats allow us to conduct our thinking as a conductor might lead an orchestra. We can call forth what we will. Similarly, in any meeting it is very useful to ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=121))

- With the Six Hats method the emphasis is on ‘what can be’ rather than just on ‘what is’, and on how we design a way forward – not on who is right and who is wrong. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=147))

- An antelope grazing in Africa hears a sound in the grass. Immediately all the neuronal clusters concerned with danger are activated so that the lion is recognized as soon as it emerges from the grass, and the antelope is able to escape. Such sensitization is a key part of how the brain works and why it is so efficient. It is not possible to be sensitized in different directions at the same time just as it would not be possible to design a golf club that was the best club for driving and at the same time the best club for putting. That is why the Six Hats method is essential. It allows the brain to maximize its sensitivity in different directions at different times. It is simply not possible to have that maximum sensitization in different directions all at the same time. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=150))

- Plato used this analogy to point out that as we go through life we can see only the ‘shadows’ of the truth. Aristotle systematized inclusion/exclusion logic. From past experience we would put together ‘boxes’, definitions, categories or principles. When we came across something, we judged into which box it fell. Something could be in the box or not in the box. It could not be half in and half out – nor could it be anywhere else. As a result, Western thinking is concerned with ‘what is’, which is determined by analysis, judgement and argument. That is a fine and useful system. But there is another whole aspect of thinking that is concerned with ‘what can ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=163))

- be’, which involves constructive thinking, creative thinking and ‘designing a way forward’. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=168))

- A thinking system based on argument is excellent just as the front left wheel of a car is excellent. There is nothing wrong with it at all. But it is not sufficient. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=176))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- From the past we create standard situations. We judge into which ‘standard situation box’ a new situation falls. Once we have made this judgement, our course of action is clear. Such a system works very well in a stable world. In a stable world the standard situations of the past still apply. But in a changing world the standard situations may no longer apply. Instead of judging our way forward, we need to design our way forward. We need to be thinking about ‘what can be’, not just about ‘what is’. Yet the basic tradition of Western thinking (or any other thinking) has not provided a simple model of constructive thinking. That is precisely what the Six Hats method (parallel thinking) is all about. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=181))

- Directions and Hats The essence of parallel thinking is that at any moment everyone is looking in the same direction – but the direction can be changed. An explorer might be asked to look north or to look east. Those are standard direction labels. So we need some direction labels for thinking. What are the different directions in which thinkers can be invited to look? This is where the hats come in. In many cultures there is already a strong association between thinking and ‘thinking hats’ or ‘thinking caps’. The value of a hat as a symbol is that it indicates a role. People are said to be wearing a certain hat. Another advantage is that a hat can be put on or taken off with ease. A hat is also visible to everyone around. For those reasons I chose hats as the symbols for the directions of thinking. Although physical hats are sometimes used, the hats are usually imaginary. Posters of the hats on the walls of meeting rooms often are used, however, as a reminder of the directions. There are six coloured hats corresponding to the six directions of thinking: white, red, black, yellow, green, blue. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=198))

- Directions Not Descriptions It is very important to note that the hats are directions and not descriptions of what has happened. It is not a matter of everyone saying what they like and then the hats being used to describe what has been said. It is a matter of setting out to think in that direction. ‘Let’s have some white hat thinking here’ means a deliberate focus on information. Everyone now tries to think of information that is available, information that is needed, questions to be asked, other ways of getting information, and so on. ‘I want your red hat on this’ is a specific request for feelings, intuition and emotions on a particular issue. ‘That is good black hat thinking; now let us switch to some yellow hat thinking …’ In this case the term black hat describes thinking that seems to be cautious and seems to point out possible difficulties, but the main intention is to ask for a switch to the yellow hat direction (benefits, values, and so forth). It is extremely important to appreciate the difference between description and direction. A description is concerned with what has happened. A direction is concerned with what is about to happen. ‘I want you to look to the east’ is very different from ‘You have been looking to the east.’ ‘I want you to cook some scrambled eggs’ is very different from ‘I see that you have cooked some scrambled eggs.’ Not Categories of People It is possible to create tests to determine whether a person is type A or type B, or any similar descriptive discriminations. Psychologists do that all the time. The difficulty is that once people have been put into ‘boxes’ they tend to stay there. Again, that is an example of ‘what is’ instead of ‘what can be’. In a race a thin man would usually beat a fat man (‘what is’). But if the fat man learns to ride a bicycle, then the fat man will beat the thin man (‘what can be’). There is a huge temptation to use the hats to describe and categorize people, such as… ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=207))

- If you drive a car with manual gears, you use all the gears. In the engine of your car all the cylinders are firing. The hats are directions of thinking. Every person must be able, and skilled, to look in all the directions. For those reasons the use of the hats as labels is dangerous because it destroys the… ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=228))

- Note on Using the Thinking Hats When people tell me that they have been using the Six Hats method, I often ask how they have been using it, and discover that sometimes they have been using it incorrectly. In a meeting, someone has been chosen as the black hat thinker, someone else as the white hat thinker, and so on. The people then keep those roles for the whole meeting. That is almost exactly the opposite of how the system should be used. The whole point of parallel thinking is that the experience and intelligence of everyone should be used in each direction. So everyone present wears the black hat at the… ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=231))

- Showing Off Many people tell me that they enjoy argument because they can show off how clever they are. They can win arguments and demolish opponents. None of that is very constructive but there may be a human need to show off. Thus showing off is not excluded from parallel thinking and the Six Hats method. A thinker now shows off by showing how many considerations he or she can put forward under the yellow hat, how many under the black hat, and so forth. You show off by performing well as a thinker. You show off by performing better as a… ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=237))

- Playing the Game There are all sorts of attempts made to change the personalities of people. It is believed that if you point out a personality type or a weakness, the person will seek to compensate for that weakness. Such methods are generally slow, ineffective and do not work. Once people are put into a certain ‘box’ or category they may try to compensate. But the effort of compensation reminds them of ‘what they are’, so they sink even deeper into that category. Ever since Freud, the emphasis has been on analysis: find out the deep truths and motivations for action. Confucius’s approach was almost the exact opposite. Instead of focusing on personality he chose to focus directly on behaviour. He urged you to use the right behaviour with your colleagues, your subordinates, your superiors and your family. Confucius was not the least bit interested… ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=243))

- one is going to try to make you less aggressive. But if the yellow hat is in use, then you are to use your aggression in that direction. By going straight to behaviour, the Six Hats method is much more acceptable and effective and quick than methods that set out to change personalities. The ‘game’ aspect of the Six Hats is very important. If a game is being played, then anyone who does not obey the rules of the game is considered uncooperative. If there is a switch from the black hat (caution) to the yellow hat (possible benefits) and a person continues to lay out the potential… ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=251))

- With the Six Hats method, we try to do only one thing at a time. There is a time when we look for danger (black hat). There is a time when we seek new ideas (green hat). There is a time when we focus on information (white hat). We do not try to do everything at the same time. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=292))

- Aeroplanes coming in to land often fly over car parks. If you tell yourself to notice the yellow cars, then suddenly the yellow cars stand out and make themselves visible. That is an example of sensitization. You cannot be sensitized in different directions at the same time, so when we set out to do all aspects of thinking in the same moment, we are going to be suboptimal on all of them. All the points mentioned in this section may seem obvious and logical. In fact, there is no mystery about them. When the Six Hats method is used, the advantages soon become clear. Instead of rambling, ego-driven meetings, meetings are now constructive, productive and much faster. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=298))

- Each of the six thinking hats has a colour: white, red, black, yellow, green, blue. The colour provides the name for the hat. I could have chosen clever Greek names to indicate the type of thinking required by each hat. That would have been impressive and would have pleased some people. But it would be of little practical value since the names would be difficult to remember. I want thinkers to visualize and to imagine the hats as actual hats. For this to happen colour is important. How else could you distinguish between the hats? Different shapes would again be difficult to learn and would be confusing. Colour makes the imaging easier. The colour of each hat is also related to its function. White Hat White is neutral and objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures. Red Hat Red suggests anger (seeing red), rage and emotions. The red hat gives the emotional view. Black Hat Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea. Yellow Hat Yellow is sunny and positive. The yellow hat is optimistic and covers hope and positive thinking. Green Hat Green is grass, vegetation and abundant, fertile growth. The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas. Blue Hat Blue is cool, and it is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organization of the thinking process and the use of the other hats. If you remember the colour and the associations of each hat, remembering the function of the hat will then follow. You may also think of three pairs of hats: White and red Black and yellow Green and blue In practice the hats are always referred to by their colour and never by their function. There is a good reason for this. If you ask someone to give his or her emotional reaction to something, you are unlikely to get an honest answer because people think it is wrong to be emotional. But the term red hat is neutral. You can ask someone to ‘take off the black hat for a moment’ more easily than you can ask that person to stop being cautious. The neutrality of the colours allows the hats to be used without embarrassment. Thinking becomes a game with defined rules rather than a matter of exhortation and condemnation. The hats are referred to directly: … I want you to take off your black hat. …… ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=307))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is not necessary to specify a hat every time you open your mouth. The hats are there for you to use at your discretion as a formal means to ask for a certain type of thinking. Once people have been trained in the use of the hats, they know exactly how to respond. Instead of the general and vague request to ‘think about this’, there is now a precise way to ask for a particular mode of thinking. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=356))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Discipline Discipline is very important. Members of the group must stay with the hat that is indicated at that moment. A member of the group is not permitted to say: ‘I want to put on my black hat here.’ That would mean going back to the usual argument mode. Only the group leader, chairperson or facilitator can indicate a change of hat. The hats cannot be used to describe what you want to say. The hats indicate the direction in which to think. It is very important that this discipline be maintained. After using the method for a while, people find it much easier to stay with the specified hat. Timing How much time should be allowed under each hat? I prefer to set a short time. That forces people to concentrate on what they are trying to do and reduces aimless waffle. I would normally allow one minute per person present. So if there are four people in the meeting, then four minutes would be allowed under each hat. If genuine ideas are still being put forward after that time, I would extend the time. So if under the black hat ‘concern’ points were being raised, there is no need to say: ‘Sorry, time’s up.’ You can extend the time as long as genuine points are being made. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=369))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is much better to set a short time and to extend it rather than set a long time and have people sitting around wondering what to say. The red hat is different from the other hats with regard to timing. Only a short time is needed to get the red hat feeling from each of those present since there should not be explanations or qualifications. The expression of feeling should be brisk and definite. Often as little as one minute is enough for everyone present to express his or her feelings. Guidelines There is no one right sequence to follow. Any sequence of hats that makes sense to you will work. Some sequences are appropriate for exploration, some for problem solving, for dispute settlement, for decision making, and so forth. Just as a carpenter has to get used to the feel and use of tools, so it is important to get used to setting up sequences and using them. A blue hat should always be used both at the beginning and at the end of the session – like two bookends. The first blue hat indicates why we are here, what we are thinking about, the definition of the situation (or problem), alternative definitions, what we want to achieve, ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=379))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- where we want to end up, the background to the thinking and a plan for the sequence of hats to be used. The final blue hat indicates what we have achieved, outcome, conclusion, design, solution, and next steps. What follows the first blue hat depends on the nature of the thinking. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=392))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Sometimes you may want to put a red hat after the final blue hat. This final red hat reflects back on the ‘thinking performance’: What do we feel about our thinking? Are we happy with the outcome? Did we do a good job? These are only some of the guidelines. There is a fuller set of guidelines with specific sequences for different situations in the formal training sessions given by authorized trainers, where there is an opportunity to select and practise sequences. In general, any sequence that makes sense as a ‘thinking strategy’ is valid and will work. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=410))

- Think of paper. Think of a computer printout. The white hat is about information. When the white hat is in use, everyone focuses directly and exclusively on information. What information do we have? What information do we need? What information is missing? What questions do we need to ask? How are we going to get the information we need? The information can range from hard facts and figures that can be checked to soft information like opinions and feelings. If you express your own feeling, that is red hat, but if you report on someone else expressing a feeling, that is white hat. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=436))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When two offered pieces of information disagree, there is no argument on that point. Both pieces of information are put down in parallel. Only if it becomes essential to choose between them will the choice be made. The white hat is usually used towards the beginning of a thinking session as a background for the thinking that is going to take place. The white hat also can be used towards the end of the session as a sort of assessment: Do our proposals fit in with the existing information? The white hat is neutral. The white hat reports on the world. The white hat is not for generating ideas though it is permissible to report on ideas that are in use or have been suggested. A very important part of the white hat is to define the information that is missing and needed. The white hat defines the questions that should be asked. The white hat lays out the means (such as surveys and questionnaires) for obtaining the needed information. White hat energy is directed at seeking out and laying out information. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=441))

- Can you role-play being a computer? Just give the facts in a neutral and objective manner. Never mind the interpretation: just the facts, please. What are the facts in this matter? Computers are not yet emotional (though we shall probably have to make them emotional if they are to think intelligently). We expect a computer to show us the facts and figures on demand. We do not expect a computer to argue with us and to use its facts and figures only in support of its argument. Too often the facts and figures are embedded in an argument. The facts are used for some purpose rather than presented as facts. Facts and figures can never be treated objectively when put forward as part of an argument. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=452))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So we badly need a switch that says: ‘Just the facts please – without the argument.’ Unfortunately, Western thinking, with its argument habits, prefers to give a conclusion first and then to bring in the facts to support that conclusion. In contrast, in the map-making type of thinking that I am advocating, we have to make the map first and then choose the route. That means that we have to have the facts and figures first. So white hat thinking is a convenient way of asking for the facts and figures to be put forward in a neutral and objective manner.

- The white hat gives a sort of direction to aim towards in dealing with information. We can aim to play the white hat role as well as possible. This means aiming to get the pure facts. It is obvious that the white hat role involves some skill – perhaps more than the other hats. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=499))

- which encourages the thinker to separate quite clearly in his or her own mind what is fact and what is extrapolation or interpretation. It might be imagined that politicians would have considerable difficulty with white hat thinking. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=513))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is it a fact or a likelihood? Is it a fact or is it a belief? Are there any facts? Much of what passes for fact is simply a comment made in good faith or is a matter of personal belief at the moment. Life has to proceed. It is not possible to check out everything with the rigour demanded of a scientific experiment. So in practice we establish a sort of two-tier system: believed facts and checked facts. We are certainly allowed to put forward believed facts under white hat thinking, but we must make it absolutely clear that these are second-class facts. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=517))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The important point is the use to which the facts are to be put. Before we act upon a fact or make it the basis for a decision, we do need to check it. So we assess which of the believed facts could be useful and then proceed to try to verify it. For example, if the believed quietness of the Boeing 757 is vital to the siting of an airport, then we certainly need to take that from the ‘believed’ status to the ‘checked’ status. The key rule for white hat thinking is that something should not be put forward at a higher level than is actually ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=530))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the case. When the statement is properly framed as a belief, then the input is permissible. Keep in mind the two-tier system. Let me repeat that we do definitely need the belief tier because the tentative, the hypothetical and the provocative are essential for thinking. They provide the frameworks which move ahead of the facts. We come now to a rather difficult point. When does ‘belief’ become ‘opinion’? I can ‘believe’ that the Boeing 757 is quieter. I can also ‘believe’ (opinion) that women smoke more because they are now under more stress. Let me say at once that your own opinion is never permissible under white hat thinking. That would destroy the whole purpose of the white hat. You can, of course, report the actual opinion of someone else. … It is Professor Schmidt’s opinion that man-powered flight will never be possible. Note very carefully that the belief level of fact simply means something which you believe to be a fact but have not yet checked out thoroughly. You might prefer to have the two tiers as 1 checked fact, and 2 unchecked fact (belief). ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=534))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The purpose of white hat thinking is to be practical. So we must be able to put forward all sorts of information. The key point is to frame it properly. … All the experts predict that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year. … I talked to four experts and each of them predicted that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year. … I talked to Mr Flint, Mr Ziegler, Ms Cagliatto and Mr Suarez and all of them predicted that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year. Here we see three levels of precision. Even the third level may not be good enough. I may want to know when you talked to these experts. There is nothing absolute about white hat thinking. It is a direction in which we strive to get better. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=631))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is clear that white hat thinking excludes such valuable things as hunch, intuition, judgement based on experience, feeling, impression and opinion. That is, of course, the purpose of having the white hat: to have a way of asking only for information. … You have asked for my white hat thinking on why I am changing jobs. The salary is no better. The perks are no better. The distance from home is no different. The career prospects are the same. The type of job is identical. That is all I can say under the white hat.

- Chapter 9 Summary of White Hat Thinking Imagine a computer that gives the facts and figures for which it is asked. The computer is neutral and objective. It does not offer interpretations or opinions. When wearing the white thinking hat, the thinker should imitate the computer. The person requesting the information should use focusing questions in order to obtain information or to fill in information gaps. In practice there is a two-tier system of information. The first tier contains checked and proven facts – first-class facts. The second tier contains facts that are believed to be true but have not yet been fully checked – second-class facts. There is a spectrum of likelihood ranging from ‘always true’ to ‘never true’. In between there are usable levels such as ‘by and large’, ‘sometimes’, and ‘occasionally’. Information of this sort can be put out under the white hat, ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=661))

- Do emotions muck up thinking, or are they part of it? At what point do emotions come in? Can emotional people be good thinkers? The traditional view is that emotions muck up thinking. The good thinker is supposed to be cool and detached and not influenced by emotion. The good thinker is supposed to be objective and to consider the facts in their own right and not for their relevance to his or her emotional needs. It is even claimed, from time to time, that women are much too emotional to make good thinkers. It is said that women lack the detachment that is needed for good decisions. Yet any good decision must be emotional in the end. I place the emphasis on that phrase in the end. When we have used thinking to make the map, our choice of route is ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=724))

They are a necessary part of the operation of the brain, not an intrusion or some relic of the age of animal survival. There are three points at which emotion can affect thinking. There may be a strong background emotion such as fear, anger, hatred, suspicion, jealousy or love. This background limits and colours all perception. The purpose of red hat thinking is to make visible this background so that its subsequent influence can be observed. The whole of thinking may be dominated by such a background emotion. The background emotion may be attached to a person or a situation or it may be in place for other reasons. In the second instance the emotion is triggered by the initial perception. You perceive yourself to have been insulted by someone and thereafter your whole thinking about that person is coloured by this feeling. You perceive (perhaps falsely) that someone is saying something out of… ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=731))

- opportunity to bring such feelings directly to the surface as soon as they arise. … If I were to put on my red hat, I would say that your offer could be seen as furthering your own interests rather than that of the company. … My red hat thinking tells me you want to oppose the merger in order to preserve your job rather than to benefit the shareholders. The third point at which emotions can come in is after a map of the situation has been put together. Such a map should also include the emotions turned up by red hat thinking. Emotions – including a great deal of self-interest – are then brought in to choose the route on the map. Every decision has a value base. We react emotionally to values. Our reaction to the value of freedom is emotional (especially if we have been deprived of freedom). … Now that we have as clear a picture of the situation as we… ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=742))

- negotiation. Neither side has been hurt enough to want to give up anything. For those who see the value of expressing the emotions involved in thinking about a certain matter, the red hat idiom provides a useful means of legitimizing those emotions so that they can take their place on the final map. But could red hat thinking ever draw out those emotions which must be kept hidden? … I am opposing her appointment because I am jealous of her and her quick rise to power. Would anyone ever really reveal such jealousy? Probably not. But the red hat idiom allows a way around this. … I am going to put on my red hat and I am then going to say that I feel that opposition to the promotion of Anne may be based, in part, on jealousy. Alternatively: … I am going to take cover under my red hat… ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=751))

- Wearing the red hat allows the thinker to say: ‘This is how I feel about the matter.’ The red hat legitimizes emotions and feelings as an important part of thinking. The red hat makes feelings visible so that they can become part of the thinking map and also part of the value system that chooses the route on the map. The red hat provides a convenient method for a thinker to switch in and out of the feeling mode in a way that is not possible without such a device. The red hat allows a thinker to explore the feelings of others by asking for a red hat view. When a thinker is using the red hat, there should never be any attempt to justify the feelings or to provide a logical basis for them. The red hat covers two broad types of feeling. First, there are the ordinary emotions such as fear and dislike to the ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=925))

- more subtle ones such as suspicion. Second, there are the complex judgements that go into such types of feeling as hunch, intuition, sense, taste, aesthetic feeling and other not visibly justified types of feeling. Where an opinion has a large measure of this type of feeling, it can also fit under the red hat. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=931))

- Black hat thinking is concerned with caution. At some stage we need to consider risks, dangers, obstacles, potential problems and the downside of a suggestion. It would be extremely foolish to proceed with any suggestion unless full consideration has been given to the caution aspect. The black hat is about being careful. The black hat seeks to avoid dangers and difficulties. The black hat points out matters that need attention because they may be weak or harmful. The black hat draws us to matters that need our attention. The black hat can be used as part of assessment: should we proceed with this suggestion? The black hat is used in the design process: what are the weaknesses that we need to overcome? ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=1090))

- The black hat seeks to lay out the risks and potential problems in the future: what may go wrong if we implement this suggestion? The black hat is very much about ‘fit’. Does this suggestion fit our past experiences? Does this suggestion fit our policy and strategy? Does this suggestion fit our ethics and values? Does this suggestion fit our resources? Does this suggestion fit the known facts and the experience of others? Under the black hat we focus directly on the ‘caution’ aspects. This is the basis of survival, of success and of civilization. Black hat thinking may point out procedural errors in the thinking itself. But black hat thinking is not argument and must not be allowed to degenerate into argument. The purpose of black hat thinking is to put the caution points on the map. Black hat thinking can be abused and overused if it is the only mode of thinking. This abuse in no way diminishes the value of the black hat, just as the dangerous and reckless driving of a car does not mean that cars are dangerous.

- Yellow hat thinking is positive and constructive. The yellow colour symbolizes sunshine, brightness and optimism. Yellow hat thinking is concerned with positive assessment, just as black hat thinking is concerned with negative assessment. Yellow hat thinking covers a positive spectrum ranging from the logical and practical at one end to dreams, visions and hopes at the other end. Yellow hat thinking probes and explores for value and benefit. Yellow hat thinking then strives to find logical support for this value and benefit. Yellow hat thinking seeks to put forward soundly based optimism but is not restricted to this – provided other types of optimism are appropriately labelled. Yellow hat thinking is constructive and generative. From yellow hat thinking come concrete proposals and suggestions. Yellow hat thinking is concerned with operacy and with making things happen. Effectiveness is the aim of yellow hat constructive thinking. Yellow hat thinking can be speculative and opportunity seeking. Yellow hat thinking also permits visions and dreams. Yellow hat thinking is not concerned with mere positive euphoria (red hat) nor directly with creating new ideas (green hat).

- The green hat is for creative thinking. The person who puts on the green hat is going to use the idioms of creative thinking. Those around are required to treat the output as a creative output. Ideally both thinker and listener should be wearing green hats. The green colour symbolizes fertility, growth and the value of seeds. The search for alternatives is a fundamental aspect of green hat thinking. There is a need to go beyond the known and the obvious and the satisfactory. The green hat thinker uses the creative pause to consider, at any point, whether there might be alternative ideas. There need be no reason for this pause. In green hat thinking the idiom of movement replaces that of judgement. The thinker seeks to move forward from an idea in order to reach a new idea.

- The blue hat is the control hat. The blue hat thinker organizes the thinking itself. Blue hat thinking is thinking about the thinking needed to explore the subject. The blue hat thinker is like the conductor of the orchestra. The blue hat thinker calls for the use of the other hats. The blue hat thinker defines the subjects towards which the thinking is to be directed. Blue hat thinking sets the focus. Blue hat thinking defines the problems and shapes the questions. Blue hat thinking determines the thinking tasks that are to be carried through. Blue hat thinking is responsible for summaries, overviews and conclusions. These can take place from time to time in the course of the thinking, and also at the end. Blue hat thinking monitors the thinking and ensures that the rules of the game are observed. Blue hat thinking stops argument and insists on the map type of thinking. Blue hat thinking enforces the discipline.

- Chapter 43 Benefits of the Six Hats Method In practice, one of the most striking things about the use of the Six Hats method is that decisions seem to make themselves. When you come to the final blue hat, the decision is often obvious to everyone present. This seems hard to believe in theory, but happens very often in practice. The week following a short write-up of the method in the Financial Times (London), I had a letter from a man who had been house hunting with his wife. They could not decide whether or not to buy a large house in the country. They had discussed the matter for some hours. The man finally suggested they use the Hats, which he had read about briefly in the newspaper. He wrote to tell me that within ten minutes they had their decision – which… ([Location 1995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=1995))

- misses the point that certain hats – the red, yellow and black – are used for assessment, not just information. If you have to drive to a certain destination and the people involved know the roads only vaguely, there will be a lot of argument about which road to take. If, however, there is a road map laying out the roads, the traffic densities, and the nature of the road surface, then it is easy to choose the best road. The choice has become obvious to all. Exactly the same thing happens with the Six Hats method. If it is not possible to make a decision, then the final blue hat should lay out why it is not possible. There may be a need for more information at a certain point. There may be different values that cannot be reconciled. So the final blue hat can define a new thinking focus. That new focus can then become the task of a new thinking session. Special Techniques Under the final blue hat, it is always possible to bring in special decision-making techniques if these seem required. Such processes are… ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=2003))

- It is not really surprising that with the Six Hats method the decision seems to make itself. After all, when we make decisions on our own, we go through more or less the same process (pros, cons, feelings, facts). The Six Hats method does all that very thoroughly. So what was hitherto carried out in an individual’s mind is now done systematically and in the open. Just as in any other decision-making process, the final decision may be difficult or even impossible to make. It may require balancing two conflicting values. It may depend on speculation about the future – and there is no way of removing the uncertainty about the future. At this point, there is a need to design a way forward that may cover both choices. If that is not… ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=2014))

- Conclusion The biggest enemy of thinking is complexity, for that leads to confusion. When thinking is clear and simple, it becomes more enjoyable and more effective. The Six Thinking Hats concept is very simple to understand. It is also very simple to use. There are two main purposes to the Six Thinking Hats concept. The first purpose is to simplify thinking by allowing a thinker to deal with one thing at a time. Instead of having to take care of emotions, logic, information, hope and creativity all at the same time, the thinker is able to deal with them separately. Instead of using logic to support a half-disguised emotion, the thinker can bring the emotion to the surface with the red thinking hat without any need to justify it. The black thinking hat can then deal with the logic aspect. The second main purpose of… ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=2022))

- that he or she is being persistently negative. The person may also be asked to put on the yellow thinking hat. That is a direct request to be positive. In this way the six hats provide an idiom that is definite without being offensive. What is most important is that the idiom does not threaten a person’s ego or personality. By turning it into role-playing or even a game, the concept of the hats makes it possible to request certain types of thinking. The hats become a sort of shorthand of instruction. I am not suggesting that at every moment in our thinking we should consciously be using one hat or another. This is quite unnecessary. Occasionally we may want to go through the hats in a formal structured sequence and in such cases we would lay out the structure beforehand. More often we would want to put on one or other hat with some formality in the course of a discussion. Or we may want to request someone else at the discussion to put on a particular hat. At first this may seem a bit awkward but in time it will seem quite natural to make such a request. It is obvious that the framework will be most… ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=2029))
