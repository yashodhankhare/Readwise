## Highlights
- I did not know it but I was already coming up against one of the great pitfalls of the small operator—the almost insoluble problem of when to enter the market. These sudden drops immediately after he has invested his money are one ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=160))
- of the most mystifying phenomena facing the amateur. It took me years to realize that when these financial tipsters advise the small operator to buy a stock, those professionals who have bought the stock much earlier on inside information are selling.

- Besides, whenever a trade was successful I praised myself; when I lost, I blamed it on the broker. I continued to trade constantly. I telephoned my broker sometimes twenty times a day. If I did not conduct at least one transaction a ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=254))
- day I did not feel I was fulfilling my role in the market. If I saw a new stock I wanted to have it. I reached out for fresh stocks like a child for new toys. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=256))
- But these losses were more than offset by the great pride I felt in being part of Wall Street, and I constantly searched for new approaches. One ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=389))

- whenever they bought or sold stocks of their own company. Now, that was something! Here was a way for me to know what the real "insiders" were doing. All I had to do was to follow them. If they were buying, I would buy. If they were selling, I would sell… ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=393))

They can be wrong. I should ignore… ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=401))

The fundamental approach… ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=405))

I had bought it and forgotten it, simply because I was too busy on the telephone jumping in and out of dozens of… ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=410))

- How to find it by myself? I decided to have a look at VIRGINIAN RAILWAY. What had caused its steady rise while other stocks were jumping about? I asked my broker for information. He told me that the company paid a good dividend and had a… ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=420))
- knew the reason for the steady rise. It was a fundamental reason. This convinced me of the Tightness of my fundamental approach. I made up my mind to refine this approach. I read, studied, analyzed. I set out to find the ideal… ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=422))
- I could find out all about a stock and decide whether it was a good investment. I began to learn all about balance sheets and income accounts. Words like "assets," "liabilities," "capitalization," and "write-offs" became commonplace… ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=425))

I compared their assets, their liabilities, their profit margins, their price-earnings ratios.

When things looked perfect on paper, when balance sheets seemed right, the… ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=432))

- advanced in price while my two selections did not. I found this pattern repeatedly in other industry groups. Baffled and a little disconcerted, I wondered whether it would not be wiser to adopt the judgment of a higher authority about the merits of a company. I asked my broker whether there was such an authority. He recommended a widely used, serious, very reliable monthly service, which gives the vital data on several thousand stocks—the nature of their business, their price ranges for at least twenty years, their dividend payments, their financial structure and their per-share annual earnings. It also rates each stock… ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=437))

- need for me to analyze balance sheets and income accounts. It was all spelled out for me here, I had only to compare: A is better than B, C is better than D. I was absorbed and happy with this new approach. To me it had the charm of cold science. No longer was I the plaything of frantic, worrying rumor. I was becoming the cool, detached financier. I was sure I was laying the foundation of my fortune. I now felt competent and confident. I listened to no one, I asked no one for advice. I decided everything I had done before was as slaphappy as my Canadian gambling period.… ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=452))
- From my reading I knew that stocks —like herds, indeed—form groups according to the industry they represent and that stocks belonging to the same industry have the tendency to move together in the market, either up or down. It seemed only logical to me that I should try to find through fundamental analysis: The strongest industry group; The strongest company within that industry group.… ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=462))

- When I read the quotations of GENERAL MOTORS I automatically looked at those of CHRYSLER, STUDEBAKER and AMERICAN MOTORS. If I looked at KAISER ALUMINUM, my eye automatically glanced afterwards at REYNOLDS METALS, ALCOA, and ALUMINIUM LTD. Instead of reading the stock tables in A.. B.. C.. order, I always read them in industry groups. Whenever a stock started to behave better than the market generally I immediately looked at the behavior of its brothers— stocks of the same industry group. If I found that its brothers also behaved well, I looked for the head of the… ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=469))
- And so I started. First I examined my past experiences. On one hand, using the fundamental approach, I was wrong. On the ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=560))
- other hand, using the technical approach, I was right. Obviously the best method was to try to repeat the successful approach I had used with TEXAS GULF PRODUCING. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=561))
- I was happy and excited—not so much because of the money but simply because I had bought M & M WOOD WORKING, as I had bought TEXAS GULF PRODUCING , purely on the basis of its action in the market. I knew nothing about it nor could I find out very much. Yet I assumed from its continuing rise and high volume that some people knew a lot more about it than I did. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=571))
- This proved to be correct. After I had sold it, I found out from the newspaper that the steady rise had been due to a merger, which was being secretly negotiated. It was eventually revealed that another company planned to take over M & M WOOD WORKING for $35 a share, and this offer was accepted. This also meant that although I was ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=574))
- in complete ignorance about the behind- the-scene deal, I had only sold out 2 points under the high. I was fascinated to realize that my buying, based purely on the stock's behavior, enabled me to profit from a proposed merger without knowing anything about it. I was an insider without actually being one. This experience did more than anything to convince me that the purely technical approach to the market was sound. It meant that if I studied price action and volume, discarding all other factors, I could get positive results. I now began to try to work from this point of view. I concentrated on a close study of price and volume and tried to ignore all rumors, tips or fundamental information. I decided not to concern myself with… ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=577))
- because many people are anxious to buy it. If I could train my eyes to spot this upward change in its early stages, as in the case of M & M WOOD WORKING, I could participate in the stock's rise without knowing the reason for it. The problem was: How to detect this change? After much thinking I found one criterion—that was to compare stocks with people. This is how I began to work it out: If a tempestuous beauty were to jump on a table and do a wild dance, no one would be particularly astonished. That is the sort of characteristic behavior people have come to expect from her. But if a dignified matron were suddenly to do the same, this would be unusual and… ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=584))
- I would consider this unusual, and if it also advanced in price I would buy it. I would assume that somewhere behind the out-of-the-ordinary movement there was a group who had some good information. By buying the stock I would become their silent partner.   I tried this approach. Sometimes I was successful, sometimes not. What I did not realize was that my eyes were not sufficiently trained yet, and exactly when I started to feel confident I could operate on my theory, I was in for a rude awakening. In May 19561 noticed a stock called PITTSBURGH METALLURGICAL, which at that time was quoted at 67, It was a fast-moving, dynamic stock and I thought… ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=591))
- all caution overboard and when the stock—contrary to my expectation—began to weaken, I thought this was just a small reaction. I was sure that after the slight drop it was set for another big upward move. The move was there all right—but it was in the wrong direction. Ten days later PITTSBURGH METALLURGICAL stood at 57¾. I sold it. My loss was $2,023.32. Something was obviously wrong. Everything clearly pointed to the stock as the best in the market at that time and still, no sooner had I bought it, than it dropped. And what was more disillusioning, no sooner did I sell it than it started to move up. Trying to find an explanation, I examined the stock's previous movements and discovered that I had bought it at the top of an… ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=599))
- bought the right stock at the wrong time. Looking back I could see this very clearly. I could see exactly why the stock had performed the way it did—afterwards. The question, however, was: How to judge a movement at the time it happens? It was a simple, straightforward problem, but it was complex in its enormity. I already knew that book systems did not help, balance sheets were useless information was suspect and wrong. Clutching at a straw, I decided to make an extensive study of individual stock movements. How do they act? What are the characteristics of their behavior? Is there any pattern in their fluctuations? I read… ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=606))
- started to realize that stock movements were not completely haphazard. Stocks did not fly like balloons in any direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or downward trend, which, once established, tended to continue. Within this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call "boxes".   They would oscillate fairly consistently between a low and a high point. The area, which enclosed this up-and- down movement, represented the box or frame. These boxes began to exist very clearly for me.  This was the beginning of my box theory, which was to lead to a fortune. This is how I… ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=614))
- to watch it. It could bounce between the top and the bottom of the box and I was perfectly satisfied. Once I had decided on the dimensions of the box, the stock could do what it liked, but only within that frame. In fact, if it did not bounce up and down inside that box I was worried. No bouncing, no movement, meant it was not a lively stock. And if it were not a lively stock I was not interested in it because that meant it would probably not rise dynamically. Take a stock, which was within the 45/50 box. It could bounce between those figures as often as it liked and I would still consider buying it. If, however, it fell to 44½ , I eliminated it as… ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=621))
- I found that a stock sometimes stayed for weeks in one box. I did not care how long it stayed in its box as long as it did and did not fall below the lower frame figure. I observed, for instance, that when a stock was in the 45/50 box it might read like this: 45. 47 - 49. 50 - 45 - 47 This meant that, after reaching a high at 50, it could react to a low at 45 then close every day at 46 or 47 and I was quite happy. It was still within its box. But, of course, the movement I was constantly watching for was an upward thrust toward the next box. If this occurred I bought the stock. I did not find any fixed rule as to how this takes place. It just has to be observed and… ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=630))
- another, upper box. Then its movement began to read something like this: 48 - 52 - 50 - 55 - 51 - 50 - 53 - 52   It was now quite clearly establishing itself in its next box—the 50/55 box.    Do not misunderstand me on this. These are only examples. What I had to decide was the range of the box. This, of course, varied with different stocks. For instance, some stocks moved in a very small frame, perhaps not more than 10% each way. Other wide-swinging stocks moved in a frame between 15% and 20%. The task was to define the frame exactly and be sure the stock did not move decisively below the lower edge… ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=638))
- normal. It did not mean to me that the stock was going to fall back. Just the contrary. Before a dancer leaps into the air he goes into a crouch to set himself for the spring. I found it was the same with stocks. They usually did not suddenly shoot up from 50 to 70. In other words, I considered that a stock in upward trend that reacted to 45 after reaching 50 was like a dancer crouching, ready for the spring-up. Later when I had more experience I also learned that this 45 position in a stock after a 50 high point has another important benefit. It shakes out the weak and frightened stockholders who mistake this reaction for a drop, and enables the stock to advance more rapidly. I came to see that when a stock was on a… ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=646))
- the right rhythm. It might have gone like this: 50 - 52 - 57 - 58 - 60 - 55 - 52 - 56 That meant it was in the 52/60 box. After this, on an upward swing, it might have gone: 58 - 61 - 66 - 70 - 66 - 63 - 66   This meant it was well inside the 63/70 box. I also considered that it was still edging towards higher spheres. The major problem still remained; what was the right time to buy into it? Logically, it was the moment when it… ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=654))
- For weeks I watched the behavior of this stock and… ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=662))
- pyramiding boxes. When the upper frame of its last box was 59¾ I felt I had assessed it correctly. I told the broker to telephone me when it reached 61, which I considered the door of its new box. He did, but I was not in my hotel room when the call came. It took him two hours to reach me. By the time he did, the stock was quoted at 63. I was disappointed. I felt I had been deprived of a great opportunity.    I was angry at the way it had passed me at 61 and when it went to 63 in such a short time I was certain I had missed a very good thing. Good reason deserted me in my excitement. I would have paid any price for this stock in my enthusiasm. I… ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=662))
- could not wait any longer. I bought 100 shares at 65—at the top of its new box—because I had missed it at the bottom. Although I was improving in my selection and method, I was still somewhat of a baby in the mechanics of Wall Street, so I placed my problem before the broker. We discussed the 61-point telephone call, which had unfortunately missed me. He told me I should have put in an automatic "on stop" buy order. This meant the stock would have been bought when it rose to 61. He suggested that whenever I made a decision about a stock I should put in a buy order at a named figure. Then the stock would be bought for me without further consultation if the market reached this figure. This I agreed to do. My problem of buying… ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=670))
- successfully. I bought ALLEGHENY LUDLUM STEEL when it appeared to me to be going into the 45/50 box. I bought 200 shares at 45¾ and sold them three weeks later at 51. I also bought 300 shares of DRESSER INDUSTRIES when it seemed to be entering the 84/92 box. I bought at 84, but as it did not seem to be making the right progress through the box, I sold at 86½. Then I bought 300 shares of COOPER-BESSEMER at the bottom edge of the 40/45 box at 40¾ and sold at 45½•   My profit on these three transactions was $2,442.36. This gave me a great deal of… ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=678))
- NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION at 94⅜ because I was sure it was about to establish itself in a new box over 100. It did not. Almost immediately it turned around and started to fall back. I could have sold it when it gave up a point. I could have done the same when it lost another point. But I decided against it and stubbornly held on. My pride did not let me act. The prestige of my theory was at stake. I just kept saying this stock cannot go down any further. I did not know what I learned later, that there is no such thing as cannot in the market. Any stock can do anything. By the end of the next week, the profit from my three previous operations was gone. I was back where I had started. This experience, as I see it, was an important turning point of my stock-market career. It was at this point that I finally realized that there is no sure thing in the market - I was bound to be wrong half of the time. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=687))
- I must accept this fact and readjust myself accordingly - my pride and ego would have to be subdued. I must become an impartial diagnostician, who does not identify himself with any theory or stock. I cannot merely take chances. First, I have to reduce my risks as far as humanly possible. The first step I took in that direction was to adopt what I called my quick -loss weapon. I already knew that I would be wrong half of the time. Why not accept my mistakes realistically and sell immediately at a small loss? If I bought a stock at 25, why not at the same time order the stock to be sold if it returned below 24? I decided to give "on-stop" orders to buy at a certain figure with an automatic "stop-loss" order on them in case the stock went down. This way, I figured, I would never sleep with a loss. If any of my stocks went below the ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=695))
- price I thought they should, I would not own them when I went to bed that night. I knew that many times I would be "stopped out" for the sake of a point just to see my stock climb up immediately after. But I realized that this was not so important as stopping the big losses. Besides, I could always buy back the stock—by paying a higher price. Then I took the second equally important step. I knew that being right half of the time was not the answer to success. I began to understand how I could break even and still go broke. If I invested about $10,000 and I operated in a medium-priced stock, each operation would cost me approximately $125 in commission every time I bought a stock, and another $125 every time I… ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=703))
- commissions. This is how the commission-mice would nibble away at each operation and would finally eat up my money:   Bought 500 shares at $20   PAID (including commission) $10,125.00   Sold 500 shares at $20   RECEIVED (deducting commission) $ 9,875.00   LOSS $ 250.00   40 transactions at $250 = $10,000   There was only one answer to this… ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=711))
- most difficult problem was to discipline myself not to sell a rising stock too quickly. I always sold too quickly because I am a coward. Whenever I bought a stock at 25 and it rose to 30, I became so worried it might go back that I sold it. I knew the right thing to do but I invariably did the opposite. I decided that since I could not train myself not to get scared every time, it was better to adopt another method. This was to hold on to a rising stock but, at the same time, keep raising my stop-loss order parallel with its rise. I would keep it at such a distance that a meaningless swing in the price would not touch it off. If, however, the stock really turned around and began… ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=720))
- I realized that I would not be able to sell at the top. Anyone who claims he can consistently do this is lying. If I sold while the stock was rising, it would be a pure guess, because I could not know how far an advance might carry. This would be no cleverer a guess than anticipating that "My Fair Lady" would end its run after 200 performances. You could also guess it would go off after 300 or 400 performances. Why did it not go off at any of these figures? Because the producer would be a fool to close the show when he sees the theater full every night. It is only when he starts to notice empty seats that he considers closing the show. I carried the Broadway comparison through to the problem of selling. I would be a fool to sell a stock as long… ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=727))
- trailing stop-loss, which I moved up behind the rising price of the stock, should take care of this automatically. Having made these decisions, I then sat back and re-defined my objectives in the stock market:  Right stocks Right timing Small losses Big profits I examined my weapons: Price and volume Box theory Automatic buy-order Stop-loss sell-order   As to my basic strategy, I decided I would always do this: I would just jog along with an upward trend, trailing my… ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=734))
- I realized that there were a great many snags. There was bound to be a lot of guesswork in the operation. My estimate that I would be right half of the time could be optimistic. But at last I saw my problem more clearly than ever. I knew that I had to adopt a cold, unemotional attitude toward stocks; that I must not fall in love with them when they rose and I must not get angry when they fell; that there are no such animals as good or bad stocks.

- It was only later, as I gradually gained experience in trading through cables, that I came to see the advantages of it. No phone calls, no confusion, no contradictory rumors—these factors combined gave me a much more detached view. As I only handled five to eight stocks at a time, I automatically separated them from the confusing, jungle-like movement of the hundreds of stocks, which surrounded them. I was ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=827))

It was like a poker game in which I could not hear the betting, but I could see all the cards. I did not know it at the time, but later, as I became more experienced in the market, I realized how invaluable this was to me. Of course, the poker players would try to mislead me with words, and they would not show me their cards. But if I did not listen to their words, and constantly watched their cards, I could guess what they were doing. At first I tried to practice on paper without investing any money. But I soon discovered that working on paper was quite different from actual investing. It was like playing cards without any dollars in the pot.

With no money involved I could easily control my feelings, but as soon as I put dollars into a stock my emotions came floating quickly up to the surface. As my cables continued to arrive day after day, I slowly became accustomed to this new type of operation and started to feel more and more confident. Only one particular fact bothered me. Sometimes some of my stocks made… ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=837))

I was completely alone with my daily telegrams and my weekly issues of Barton's. They were my only contact with Wall Street, many thousands of miles away. If I wanted an explanation, I could only turn to them. So I plunged avidly into Barron's. I turned its pages until they turned to shreds before I finally discovered this: the inexplicable moves in my stocks usually coincided with some violent move in the general market. As I only received the quotes of my own stocks, I was completely disregarding the possible influence of the… ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=844))

My telegrams now read like this: "B 32½ (34½-32⅜) L 57 (58⅝-57) U 89½ (91½-89) A 120¼ (121½-120¼) F 132¼ (134⅞-132¼) 482.31" When I received the first cables with this added information, I was like a child with a new toy. I thought I had discovered a completely new formula. As I tried to relate the Dow-Jones Industrial Average to the movements of my own stocks, I reasoned that if the Average was going up, so would my stocks. Soon after, I found out that this was not… ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=852))

It simply mirrors the day -to-day behavior of 3 0 selected stocks. Other stocks are influenced by it but do not mechanically follow its pattern. I also began to appreciate that the Dow-Jones Company is not a fortune -telling organization. It does not attempt to tell you when individual stocks will rise or fall.

In the same way I found that the relationship between the Average and my individual stocks were confined within certain principles, but they could not be measured exactly. From then on, I made up my mind to keep watching the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, but only in order to determine whether I was in a strong or a weak market. This I did because I realized that a general market cycle influences almost every stock. The main cycles like a bear or a bull market usually creep into the majority of them. Now that I was armed with a finishing touch to my theory, I felt… ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=868))

But to a physician, it often contains all the information he wants to know. He relates its findings to the nature and duration of the illness, the age of the patient, etc., and only then does he draw his conclusions. Looking at my telegrams, I did something similar. I compared the prices of my stocks first with each other, then with the Dow-Jones Average, and after I weighed their trading range, I evaluated whether I should buy, sell or hold. I did this automatically without deeper analysis. I could not fully explain this to myself until I realized that I… ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=874))

I did the same when I sold it. Whenever a trade ended with a loss, I wrote down the reason I thought caused it. Then I tried not to repeat the same mistake. This is how one of my tables looked:   These cause-of-error tables helped me immeasurably. As I drew them up one after the other I was learning something from each trading.

They were consistent in their moves, logical in their behavior. They were like dependable friends. And some of them I could not handle. Each time I bought them they did me an injury. There was something almost human in their behavior. They did not seem to want me. They reminded me of a man to whom you try to be friendly but who thinks you have insulted him and so he slaps you.

I began to see that it is like driving a car. The driver can be taught how to use the accelerator, the steering wheel and the brakes, but he still has to develop his own feeling for driving. No one can tell him how to judge whether he is too close to the car in front of him or when he should slow down.

My educated guesses, no matter how cautious they were, many times turned out to be wrong. But this did not upset me any more. After all, I thought, who was I to say what a stock should or should not do? Even my mistakes did not make me unhappy. If I was right, so much the better. If I was wrong—I was sold out. This happened automatically as something apart from me. I was no longer proud if the stock went up, nor did I feel wounded if it fell.

I thought it was in the 56/61 box and it would advance. But it started reaching down, and I sold it at 55. Then I tried DOBECKMUN. I judged it was in a 44/49 box, so I bought it at 45. It began to sag and I sold it at 41. I bought DAYSTROM at 44 because I thought it was rising into the 45/50 box. I sold out at 42¼.

I had bought it at prices ranging from 23¼ to 27⅝. I watched it climb towards 30 and waited for the 31/35 box to evolve. It did not happen that way. I was stopped out of AEROQUIP at 27½.   Finally, on August 26, 1957, I found myself without a single stock. My automatic stop-loss had sold me out of everything. In two months every one of my stocks had slowly turned around, and one by one had sagged through the bottom of their boxes. And one by one, even if it was only a question of half a point, they were sold. I did not like it, but there was nothing I could ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=934))

Eager and anxious, I watched from the sidelines with not a dollar invested, while prices continued to drop. But no opportunity seemed to appear. What I did not know was that we were at the end of one phase of the great bull market. It was several months before this became evident and it was declared a bear market.

Nobody knew while the battle of Stalingrad was being fought that it was the turning point in the war. For a very long time, few people realized it. Even when the German armies were halfway back, it was still talked about as strategic withdrawal. It was, in fact, the end of Hitler. The Nazi war bull market ended the day Hitler attacked Stalingrad. In the same way, I realized that it was impossible for me to assess great historical turning points in the market when they began to happen.

The bull market I saw as a sunny summer camp filled with powerful athletes. But I had to remember that some stocks were stronger than others. The bear market? The summer camp had changed to a hospital. The great majority of stocks were sick— but some were more sick than others. When the break came almost all of the stocks had been hurt or fractured. It was now a question of estimating how sick the stocks were and how long their sickness would last.

There was no doubt in my mind now that I could not make money by buying a stock and then trying to cheer it on. JONES & LAUGHLIN had convinced me of that. I could remember how I almost felt myself willing and pushing that stock upwards. It was a very human feeling, but it had no effect upon its market any more than spectators have on a horse race. If one horse is going to win, it will win, even if thousands of onlookers are cheering for another one. It was the same now. I knew that if I bought a stock and turned out to be wrong, all the cheering and pushing in the world would not alter the price half a point.

Week after week, while I did not have any stock and the market was in a steady downtrend, I followed the quotations in Barron's. I tried to detect those stocks that resisted the decline.

The conclusion was obvious: capital was flowing into these stocks, even in a bad market. This capital was following earning improvements as a dog follows a scent.

Consequently, I decided that while there may be many reasons behind any stock movement, I would look only for one: improving earning power or… ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1034))

Yet in a converted stable in Oregon two men are working on an invention, which will far outclass the flying car. Once that is ready for the market, and a company has been formed to handle it, the original flying car will be superseded. Its stock will start to slide. It will become old-fashioned.

What I had to do was to find stocks that would be hoisted up because they stirred people's imagination for the future. On the basis of this thinking, I carefully watched stock-market quotations in this general bracket of expanding stocks in tune with the jet age. I was not interested in the company's individual products, whether it was metals for rockets, solid fuel, or advanced electronic equipment. In fact, I did not want to know what they made—that information might only inhibit me. I did not care what the company's products were, any more than I was influenced by the fact that the board chairman had a beautiful wife. But I ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1067))

This, of course, was directly against the advice of many financial writers with conservative backgrounds who have been pounding into investors for generations that they must study company reports and balance sheets, find out all they can about a stock's background, in order to make a wise investment. I decided that was not for me. All a company report and balance sheet can tell you is the past and the present. They cannot tell the future. And it was for this I had to project my plans. I also humbly realized that that was only my attitude. I was looking for capital gain. A widow looking for dividend income had to think otherwise.

I felt calm and confident waiting for the market-tide to turn. After a few months, what I was waiting for began to happen. Reading Barton's, I noticed that, while the averages were still showing a decline as they had for several months, a few stocks were beginning to peep up, almost as unnoticeable as primrose buds on a winter's day. It was still a question whether these tender shoots would survive or be killed by frost. But when I noticed this slow awakening, I began to sense the end of this baby-bear market —at least for certain stocks.

No matter how well built your house is, you would not think of forgetting to insure it against fire. Within a few days, I received confirmation that I had bought 200 LORILLARD at 27½. I was well satisfied with my purchase, and braced myself for a big rise. This came, but not the way I had assessed it. My first experience was disheartening. On Tuesday, November 26th, the stock dropped back exactly to my stop-loss of 26 and I was sold out. To add insult to injury, seconds after I was stopped out, it started to ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1172))

Again I fixed my stop-loss at 26. But this time, LORILLARD 'S behavior was perfect. As the days went by, I was satisfied to see that the quotations never came close to my stop-loss. This was a firm indication that I was on the right track, and that my theory applied to this stock. I happened to be right. In December 1957, LORILLARD rose over 30 and made a new 31/35 box. My experiences with similar stock movements in the past told me that it was being accumulated. I felt I had the right stock. Now it was a question of getting into it with more money at the right time. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1178))
- I carefully watched my daily quotes. I looked for the right moment as a fighter looks for an opening to land his blow. Towards the end of January, after a false move, the big surge-through which I had been expecting occurred, LORILLARD started to move decisively out of its box. This seemed to be the ideal moment. Everything was encouraging— the technical action, the fundamentals, the pattern. Also, the New York Stock Exchange had just lowered its margin requirements from 70% to 50%. This meant that my limited capital now had much more purchasing power. Every $1,000 could buy $ 2,000 worth of stock. This was important to me, because I needed my funds for another stock I was watching at that time.   I was flying from ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1185))

In the weeks that followed, the stock's behavior continued to be exemplary. It was exciting to watch my theory being vindicated in practice. While I was traveling around the world dancing, LORILLARD was steadily dancing about in its box. It would do this for a short time and then, with an impeccable, almost predictable thrust, move into the box above, LORILLARD boxes began piling on top of each other like a beautifully constructed pyramid. I watched them fascinated. I had never seen a stock behave so perfectly as this. It was acting as though my theory had been built around it. On February 17, 1958, LORILLARD bounced up to ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1191))

In one single day my stock had dropped to a low of 36¾ and closed at 37¾. I was baffled. This move was completely unexpected. I did not know how to explain it. I rapidly cabled New York and raised my stop -loss to 36, less than 2 points below the day's closing price. I felt if it dropped there, I would be sold out and still make a nice profit on my first purchase. As I was in Tokyo, I could not know the Wall Street rumors which had driven the stock down that day. All I knew was that it acted badly. Later I found out there had been a report saying that filter-tips were not so efficacious against lung cancer as they were claimed to be and this had ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1197))

This convinced me of the stock's power and I decided to buy an additional 400 shares. I paid 38⅝. Almost immediately we left this price behind. The quotes came in: 39¾-40¼-42. I was very happy.

A year later I met him at a party in New York, LORILLARD was then above 80. "What's your latest stock market advice?" he asked me. "Advice?" I said. I was astonished. "Wasn't that… ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1219))

- entered on an even more definite upward-thrust. It jumped 4 1/8 points in one week, its volume increased to an astounding 316,600 and it established itself decisively in the 50/54 box. In the second week of April LORILLARD left its new box. It pushed through to a new high of 55¼ but immediately dropped back to its former 50/54 box. As I did not contemplate a further purchase this did not upset me unduly. However, I cautiously raised my stop-loss to 49.   I also wavered for a moment, on the verge of selling, but I decided against it. By now I had trained myself to be… ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1226))
- During all the time that I spent with LORIIXARD and DINERS' CLUB, I never neglected to follow the quotations of other stocks in Barron's. This began to show me that there was a great interest springing up in a stock called E. L. BRUCE, a small Memphis firm. The stock was quoted on the American Stock Exchange. On closer ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1273))
- examination, I learned that the company made hardwood flooring. This most certainly did not fit my fundamental requirements, but the technical pattern was so compelling that I could not take my eyes off it. What amazed me was the movement of E. L. BRUCE on Street. It usually traded below 5,000 shares a week. Then it suddenly woke up and started to move. In the second week of April 1958, its volume rose to an astonishing 19,100 shares. Thereafter the weekly volume climbed to 41,500—54,200—76,500 shares, with the price jumping 5 to 8 points weekly without any sign of downward reaction. BRUCE went from 18 in February to 50 at the beginning of May. Only then came its first reaction, which carried it back to 43J4. I could not be sure, of course, but this reaction seemed to me only a ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1276))
- temporary halt, a refueling. I felt it would continue to rise. I tried to find a fundamental reason, but I could not. Still, the volume was there, the price action was there, the rhythm of the advance was there. I began to feel like a man sitting in a darkened theatre, waiting for the curtain to go up on a thriller. As I flew from Tokyo to Calcutta, I puzzled over the BRUCE quotations every hour of the way. It had a wider, freer range than most stocks, and I could not place a definite frame around it. Flying over the Indian Ocean, I made up my mind to make an exception. Fundamentals or no fundamentals, if it went over 50, I… ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1282))
- my savings, but after the JONES & LAUGHLIN disaster I had decided never again to risk more money than I could afford to lose without ruining myself. Consequently I have never again added to my market funds from my show-business income. The only possible thing to do was to take a close look at my old friend LORILLARD. Was it still behaving well? It was not. Its penetrations were not decisive, its reactions were deeper. I decided to take my money out of LORILLARD and be ready to invest it in BRUCE. I sold my 1,000 shares the second week in May for an average price of 57⅜. The… ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1289))
- months I had nearly doubled my capital. I felt pleased and proud and ready, like a giant-killer, to deal with a powerful and erratic stock like BRUCE. I made special preparation for this fight. I had concluded after the LORILLARD deal that my system was working so well that I did not want to entrust it into the hands of one firm. I felt if anyone were to follow my operations, this might make it difficult for me. I called New York and opened accounts with two other brokerage firms. In the third week of May 1958, I cabled New York to buy 500 BRUCE at 50¾ with my automatic on-stop buy… ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1297))

I figured that, should I be stopped out, I would only lose my DINERS' CLUB profit. These are the details of my purchases:   500 shares at 50¾ ($25,510.95) 500 shares at 51⅛ (25,698.90) 500 shares at 51¾ (26,012.20) 500 shares at 52¾ (26,513.45) 500 shares at 53⅝ (26,952.05)   Total 2,500 shares ($130,687.55)   My… ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1303))

- It was obvious even in faraway India that something fantastic was happening on the American Stock Exchange. I had to fight a hard battle with myself not to phone New York and find out what was going on. No, I said to myself as I felt like calling my brokers, that will only mean rumors and you may do something silly.

- A few days later my nail-gnawing impatience was changed to terror by a call from New York. It was one of my brokers, and he nearly stopped my heartbeat. He said: "They have suspended trading in BRUCE on the American Stock Exchange." I nearly dropped the phone as I listened. I was terrified.

With my emotions running amok, it took me a long time to understand that far from being broke, I now could sell BRUCE for $100 a share in the over-the-counter market. I was completely confused. $100 a share! What was this? I was trembling while he told me the story over the telephone from New York to Calcutta. Certain traders on Wall Street, basing their views on a purely fundamental approach, had decided that BRUCE'S book value and earnings indicated… ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1321))
- able to fulfill their bargains by buying it back at a price much nearer 30. They made a grave mistake, because there was one factor they did not know about. A New York manufacturer named Edward Gilbert was trying to oust the Bruce family from control of the company. He and his associates were trying to obtain a majority of the 314,600 shares outstanding which the Bruce family owned. It was this move that had rocketed the price. The volume was terrific, and more than 275,000 Bruce shares were traded during a period of ten weeks. The short-sellers who had so misjudged the market… ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1327))
- upward surge of the stock and they could not buy the shares at any price to fulfill their obligations. Finally, as it was impossible to assure an orderly market because of the frenzied dealings, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading. But this made no difference to the desperate short sellers. They still had to deliver the stock. Now they were willing to pay anything over-the-counter for BRUCE. I listened in a daze to all this. My broker asked me whether, since the over-the-counter price per share was now 100, I would instruct him to sell at this price. I thought back to my daily cables, and how they had begun to paint an amazing… ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1334))
- heading of "rumors" which I had sworn never to listen to again. I recalled how I held on while my daily quotes revealed to me BRUCE'S sensational upward progress, and I did not know what to do. Should I still hold on? I was faced with a very hard decision. I was offered a big, tempting profit. As I listened to my broker, I felt strongly urged to sell the stock. After all, selling at 100 meant I would make a fortune. I thought hard while I listened. Then I made one of the most momentous decisions of my life. I said: "No, I will not sell at 100. I have no reason to sell an advancing stock. I will hold onto it.… ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N3YA3AM&location=1340))
