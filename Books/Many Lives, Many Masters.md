## Highlights
- Hypnosis is an excellent tool to help a patient remember long-forgotten incidents. There is nothing mysterious about it. It is just a state of focused concentration. Under the instruction of a trained hypnotist, the patient’s body relaxes, causing the memory to sharpen. I had hypnotized hundreds of patients and had found it helpful in reducing anxiety, eliminating phobias, changing bad habits, and aiding in the recall of repressed material. On occasion, I had been successful in regressing patients back to their early childhoods, even to when they were two or three years old, thus eliciting the memories of long-forgotten traumas ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=166))

- A constantly criticized child can lose as much confidence and self-esteem as one who remembers being humiliated on one particular, horrifying day. A child whose family is impoverished and has very little food available on a day-to-day basis might eventually suffer from the same psychological problems as a child who experienced one major episode of accidental near-starvation. I would soon realize that the ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=344))

- day-in and day-out pounding of negative forces had to be recognized and resolved with as much attention as that paid to the single, overwhelmingly traumatic event. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=347))

- According to most writers, groups of souls tend to reincarnate together again and again, working out their karma (debts owed to others and to the self, lessons to be learned) over the span of many lifetimes. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=362))

- “Our task is to learn, to become God-like through knowledge. We know so little. You are here to be my teacher. I have so much to learn. By knowledge we approach God, and then we can rest. Then we come back to teach and help others.” ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=400))

- I paused before progressing her in time. I was fascinated by the way her conceptions of death and the afterlife changed so much from lifetime to lifetime. And yet her experience of death itself was so uniform, so similar, every time. A conscious part of her would leave the body around the moment of death, floating above and then being drawn to a wonderful, energizing light. She would then wait for someone to come and help her. The soul automatically passed on. Embalming, burial rituals, or any other procedure after death had nothing to do with it. It was automatic, no preparation necessary, like walking through a just-opened door. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=449))

- “They tell me there are many gods, for God is in each of us.” I recognized the voice from the in-between-lives state by its huskiness as well as by the decidedly spiritual tone of the message. What she said next left me breathless, pulling the air from my lungs. “Your father is here, and your son, who is a small child. Your father says you will know him because his name is Avrom, and your daughter is named after him. Also, his death was due to his heart. Your son’s heart was also important, for it was backward, like a chicken’s. He made a great sacrifice for you out of his ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=458))

- love. His soul is very advanced…. His death satisfied his parents’ debts. Also he wanted to show you that medicine could only go so far, that its scope is very limited.” ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=462))

- The thousands of cases recorded in the scientific literature, especially those of children speaking foreign languages to which they had never been exposed, of having birthmarks at the site of previous mortal wounds, of these same children knowing where treasured objects were hidden or buried thousands of miles away and decades or centuries earlier, all echoed Catherine’s message.

- At first, I was not aware of why I was changing so much. I knew I was more calm and patient, and others were telling me how peaceful I looked, how I seemed more rested and happier. I felt more hope, more joy, more purpose, and more satisfaction in my life. It dawned on me that I was losing the fear of death. I wasn’t afraid of my own death or of nonexistence. I was less afraid of losing others, even though I would certainly miss them. How powerful the fear of death is. People go to such great lengths to avoid the fear: mid-life crises, affairs with younger people, cosmetic surgeries, exercise obsessions, accumulating material possessions, procreating to carry on a name, striving to be more and more youthful, and so on. We are frightfully concerned with our own deaths, sometimes so much so that we forget the real purpose of our lives. I was also becoming less obsessive. I didn’t need to be in control all the time. Although I was trying to ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=513))

- We were still in the middle of the session. Catherine ended her rest and began talking about green statues in front of a temple. I roused myself from my reverie and listened. She was in an ancient lifetime, somewhere in Asia, but I was still with the Masters. Incredible, I thought to myself. She’s talking about previous lifetimes, about reincarnation, and yet compared to hearing messages from the Masters, it feels anti-climactic. I was already realizing, however, that she had to go through a lifetime before she could leave her body and reach the in-between state. She could not reach this state directly. And it was only there that she could reach the Masters. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=529))

- “I feel free … free,” Catherine gently whispered. “I’m just floating in darkness … just floating. There is a light around … and spirits, other people.” I asked if she had any thoughts about the lifetime that had just ended, her life as Christian. “I should have been more forgiving, but I wasn’t. I did not forgive the wrongs that people did to me, and I should have. I didn’t forgive the wrongs. I held them inside, and I harbored them for many years…. I see eyes … eyes.” “Eyes?” I echoed, sensing the contact. “What kind of eyes?” “The eyes of the Master Spirits,” Catherine whispered, “but I must wait. I have things to think about.” Minutes passed in tense silence. “How will you know when they are ready,” I asked expectantly, breaking the long silence. “They will call me,” she answered. More minutes passed. Then, suddenly, her head began to roll from side to side, and her voice, hoarse and firm, signaled the change. “There are many souls in this dimension. I am not the only one. We must be patient. That is something I never learned either…. There are many dimensions. …” I asked her whether she had been here before, whether she had reincarnated many times. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=593))

- “I have been to different planes at different times. Each one is a level of higher consciousness. What plane we go to depends upon how far we’ve progressed….” She was silent again. I asked her what lessons she had to learn in order to progress. She answered immediately. “That we must share our knowledge with other people. That we all have abilities far beyond what we use. Some of us find this out sooner than others. That you should check your vices before you come to this point. If you do not, you carry them over with you to another life. Only we can rid ourselves … of the bad habits that we accumulate when we are in a physical state. The Masters cannot do that for us. If you choose to fight and not to rid yourself, then you will carry them over into another life. And only when you decide that you are strong enough to master the external problems, then you will no longer have them in your next life. “We also must learn not to just go to those people whose vibrations are the same as ours. It is normal to feel drawn to somebody who is on the same level that you are. But this is wrong. You must also go to those people whose vibrations are wrong … with yours. This is the importance … in helping … these people. “We are given intuitive powers we should follow and not try to resist. Those who resist will meet with danger. We are not sent back from each plane with ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=602))

- equal powers. Some of us possess powers greater than others, because they have been accrued from other times. Thus people are not all created equal. But eventually we will reach a point where we will all be equal.” ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=612))

- So people in comas can decide whether or not to return, depending upon how much learning they have yet to accomplish in the physical state. If they feel ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=621))

- there is nothing further to learn, they can go directly to the spiritual state, modern medicine notwithstanding. This information meshed nicely with the research being published about near-death experiences, and why some people chose to return. Others were not given the choice; they had to return because there was more to learn. Of course, all of the people interviewed about their near-death experiences returned to their bodies. There is a striking similarity in their stories. They become detached from their bodies and “watch” resuscitation efforts from a point above their bodies. They eventually become aware of a bright light or a glowing “spiritual” figure in the distance, sometimes at the end of a tunnel. They feel no pain. As they become aware that their tasks on earth are not yet completed, and they must return to their bodies, they are immediately rejoined to their bodies and once again are aware of pain and other physical sensations.

- In the office, pondering Catherine’s latest revelations, I wondered what our Founding Fathers would have thought about the proposition that all humans are not created equal. People are born with talents, abilities, and powers accrued from other lifetimes. “But eventually we will reach a point where we will all be equal.” I suspected that this point was many, many lifetimes distant. I thought about the young Mozart and his incredible childhood talents. Was this also a carry-over of former abilities? Apparently we carried over abilities as well as debts. I thought about how people tended to congregate in homogeneous groups, avoiding and often fearing outsiders. This was the root of prejudice and group hatreds. “We also must learn not to just go to those people whose vibrations are the same as ours.” To help these other people. I could feel the spiritual truths in her words. “I must come back,” Catherine resumed. “I must come back.” But I wanted to hear more. I asked her who Robert Jarrod was. She had mentioned his name during the last session, stating that he needed my help. “I don’t know. … He may be in another plane, not this one.” Apparently she could not find him. “Only when he wants, only if he decides to come to me,” she ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=641))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- whispered, “he will send me a message. He needs your help.” I still could not understand how I could help. “I don’t know,” Catherine answered. “But you are the one to be taught, not I.” This was interesting. Was this material for me? Or was I to help Robert Jarrod by being taught? We never did hear from him. “I must go back,” she repeated. “I must go to the light first.” Suddenly she was alarmed. “Oh, oh, I’ve hesitated much too long…. Because I hesitated I have to wait again.” While she waited, I asked her what she was seeing and feeling. “Just other spirits, other souls. They’re waiting, too.” I asked her whether there was something to teach us while she was waiting. “Can you tell us what we must know?” I asked. “They are not here to tell me,” she replied. Fascinating. If the Masters were not there for her to hear, Catherine could not independently provide the knowledge. “I’m very restless being here. I do want to go…. When the time is right, I will go.” Again, minutes silently passed. Finally the time must have been right. She had fallen into another lifetime. “I see apple trees … and a house, a white house. I live in the house. The apples are rotten … worms, no good to eat. There is a swing, a swing on the tree.” I asked her to look at herself. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=651))

- “I have light hair, blond hair; I’m five years old. My name is Catherine.” I was surprised. She had entered her present lifetime; she was Catherine at age five. But she must be there for some reason. “Did something happen there, Catherine?” “My father is angry at us … ‘cause we’re not supposed to be outside. He … he’s hitting me with a stick. It’s very heavy; it hurts…. I’m afraid.” She was whining, speaking like a child. “He won’t stop till he’s hurt us. Why does he do this to us? Why is he so mean?” I asked her to see her life from a higher perspective and to answer her own questions. I had recently read about people being able to do this. Some writers called this perspective one’s Higher Self or Greater Self. I was curious whether Catherine could reach this state, if it existed. If she could, this would be a powerful therapeutic technique, a shortcut to insight and understanding. “He never wanted us,” she whispered very softly. “He feels we’re an intrusion in his life. … He doesn’t want us.” “Your brother, too?” I asked. “Yes, my brother even… ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=661))

- Although she was recounting a lifetime, Catherine now exhibited a wisdom and a perspective about her life that had previously been restricted to the in-between, or spiritual, state. Somehow there was a “higher” part of her mind, a sort of superconscious. Perhaps this was the Higher Self that others have described. Although not in contact with the Masters and their spectacular knowledge, nevertheless, in her superconscious state she possessed profound insights and information, such as her brother’s conception. The conscious Catherine, when awake, was much more anxious and limited, much simpler and comparatively superficial. She could not tap into this superconscious state. I wondered if the prophets and sages of Eastern and Western religions, those called “actualized,” were able to utilize this superconscious state to obtain their wisdom and knowledge. If so, then we all had the ability to do so, for we must all possess this superconscious. The psychoanalyst Carl Jung was aware of the different levels of consciousness. He wrote about the collective unconscious, a state with similarities to Catherine’s superconscious. I would become… ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=671))

- interest in philosophy or related matters. She lived in the world of everyday detail, oblivious of the genius within her. Meanwhile, her father was tormenting her, and the reasons were becoming evident. “He has many lessons to learn,” I stated in a questioning way. “Yes … so he does.” I asked her if she knew what he had to learn. “This knowledge is not revealed to me.” Her tone was detached, distant. “What is revealed to me is what is important to me, what concerns me. Each person must be concerned with him- or herself … with making him- or herself … whole. We have lessons to learn … each one of us. They must be learned one at a time … in order. Only then can we know what the next person needs, what he or she lacks or what we lack, to make us whole.” She spoke in a soft whisper, and her whisper conveyed a feeling of loving detachment. When Catherine spoke again, the childlike voice had returned. “He’s making me sick! He’s making me eat this stuff that I don’t want. It’s some food … lettuce, onions, stuff I… ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=680))

- Catherine spoke in a raspy whisper. “It must fill some void in him. He hates me because of what he did. He hates me for that, and he hates himself.” I had nearly forgotten about the sexual assault when she was three years old. “So he must punish me. … I must have done something to make him do that.” She was only three years old, and her father was drunk. Yet she had carried this guilt deep within her ever since. I explained the obvious. “You were just a baby. You must now relieve yourself of this guilt. You didn’t do anything. What could a three-year-old do? It wasn’t you; it was your father.” “He must have hated me then, too,” she gently whispered. “I knew him before, but I cannot draw on that information now. I must go back to that time.” Although several hours had already passed, I wanted to go back to their previous relationship. I gave her detailed instructions. “You are in a deep state. In a moment I am going to count backward, from three to one. You will be in a deeper state and will feel totally safe. Your mind will be free to roam back in time again, back to… ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=690))

- your cure. You can do that. Three … two … one.” There was a long pause. “I do not see him … but I see people being killed!” Her voice became loud and husky. “We have no right to abruptly halt peoples’ lives before they have lived out their karma. And we are doing it. We have no right. They will suffer greater retribution if we let them live. When they die and go to the next dimension, they will suffer there. They will be left in a very restless state. They will have no peace. And they will be sent back, but their lives will be very hard. And they will have to make up to those people that they hurt for the injustices that they did against them. They are halting these people’s lives, and they have no right to do that. Only God can punish them, not us. They will be punished.” A minute… ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=700))

- “That is for later. For now, I just feel the peace. It’s a time of comfort. The party must be comforted. The soul … the soul finds peace here. You leave all the bodily pains behind you. Your soul is peaceful and serene. It’s a wonderful feeling … wonderful, like the sun is always shining on you. The light is so brilliant! Everything comes from the light! Energy comes from this light. Our soul immediately goes there. It’s almost like ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=760))

- a magnetic force that we’re attracted to. It’s wonderful. It’s like a power source. It knows how to heal.” “Does it have a color?” “It’s many colors.” She paused, resting in this light. “What are you experiencing?” I ventured. “Nothing … just peacefulness. You’re among your friends. They are all there. I see many people. Some are familiar; others are not. But we’re there, waiting.” She continued to wait, as minutes slowly passed. I decided to push the pace. “I have a question to ask.” “Of whom,” Catherine asked. “Somebody—you or the Masters,” I hedged. “I think the understanding of this will help us. The question is this: Do we choose the times and the manner of our birth and our death? Can we choose our situation? Can we choose the time of our passing over again? I think understanding that will ease a lot of your fears. Is there anyone there who can answer that question?” The room felt cold. When Catherine spoke again, her voice was deeper and more resonant. It was a voice I had never heard before. It was the voice of a poet. “Yes, we choose when we will come into our physical state and when we will leave. We know when we have accomplished what we were sent down here to accomplish. We know when the time is up, and you will accept your death. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=764))

- For you know that you can get nothing more out of this lifetime. When you have time, when you have had the time to rest and re-energize your soul, you are allowed to choose your re-entry back into the physical state. Those people who hesitate, who are not sure of their return here, they might lose the chance that was given them, a chance to fulfill what they must when they’re in physical state.” I knew immediately and completely that this was not Catherine speaking. “Who is speaking to me,” I implored; “who is talking?” Catherine answered in her familiar soft whisper. “I don’t know. The voice of someone very … somebody who controls things, but I don’t know who it is. I can only hear his voice and try to tell you what he says.” ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=774))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “Everybody’s path is basically the same. We all must learn certain attitudes while we’re in physical state. Some of us are quicker to accept them than others. Charity, hope, faith, love … we must all know these things and know them well. It’s not just one hope and one faith and one love—so many things feed into each one of these. There are so many ways to demonstrate them. And yet we’ve only tapped into a little bit of each one…. “People of the religious orders have come closer than any of us have because they’ve taken these vows of chastity and obedience. They’ve given up so much without asking for anything in return. The rest of us continue to ask for rewards-rewards and justifications for our behavior … when there are no rewards, rewards that we want. The reward is in doing, but doing without expecting anything … doing unselfishly. “I have not learned that,” Catherine added, in her soft whisper. For a moment I was confused by the word “chastity,” but I remembered that the root meant “pure,” referring to a much different state from that of just sexual abstinence. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=793))

- “… Not to overindulge,” she continued. “Anything done to excess … in excess…. You will understand. You really do understand.” She paused again. “I’m trying,” I added. Then I decided to focus on Catherine. Perhaps the Masters had not yet left. “What can I do to best help Catherine to overcome her fears and anxieties? And to learn her lessons? Is this the best way, or should I change something? Or follow up in a specific area? How can I help her the best?” The answer came in the deep voice of the poet Master. I leaned forward in my chair. “You are doing what is correct. But this is for you, not for her.” Once again, the message was that this was for my benefit more than for Catherine’s. “For me?” “Yes. What we say is for you.” Not only was he referring to Catherine in the third person, but he said “we.” There were, indeed, several Master Spirits in attendance. “Can I know your names?” I asked, immediately wincing at the mundane nature of my question. “I need guidance. I have so much to know.” The answer was a love poem, a poem about my life and my death. The voice was soft and tender, and I felt the loving detachment of a universal spirit. I listened in awe.

- “You will be guided in time. You will be guided … in time. When you accomplish what you have been sent here to accomplish, then your life will be ended. But not before then. You have much time ahead of you … much time.” I was simultaneously anxious and relieved. I was glad he was not more specific. Catherine was becoming restless. She spoke in a small whisper. “I’m falling, falling … trying to find my life … falling.” She sighed, and I did, too. The Masters were gone. I pondered the miraculous messages, very personalized messages from very spiritual sources. The implications were overwhelming. The light after death and the life after death; our choosing when we are born and when we will die; the sure and unerring guidance of the Masters; lifetimes measured in lessons… ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=811))

- We had not had a traditional psychotherapy session for months. None was necessary. We would chat for a few minutes to catch up on the events of the week, then move quickly to the hypnotic regression. Whether due to the actual memories of major traumas or daily minitraumas or to the process of reliving the experiences, Catherine was virtually cured. Her phobias and panic attacks had just about disappeared. She had no fear of death or dying. She was no longer afraid of losing control. Psychiatrists are now using high doses of tranquilizers and antidepressant medicines to treat people with Catherine’s symptoms. In addition to the medicines, the patients are also often in intensive psychotherapy or attending phobia group therapy sessions. Many psychiatrists believe that symptoms such as Catherine’s have a biological basis, that there are deficiencies in one or several brain chemicals.

- As I hypnotized Catherine to a deep trance state, I thought about how remarkable and wonderful it was that in a period of weeks, without the use of medicines, traditional therapy, or group therapy, she was nearly cured. This was not just the suppression of symptoms nor the gritting of teeth and living through it, a life racked by fears. This was a cure, the absence of symptoms. And she was radiant, serene, and happy beyond my wildest hopes. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=848))

- Catherine had none of these symptoms or syndromes. What had occurred was not a manifestation of psychiatric illness. She was not psychotic, not out of touch with reality, and she had never suffered from hallucinations (seeing or hearing things not actually there) or delusions (false beliefs). She did not use drugs, and she had no sociopathic traits. She did not have a hysterical personality, and she did not have dissociative tendencies. That is, she was generally aware of what she was doing and thinking, did not function on “automatic pilot,” and had never had any split or multiple personalities. The material she produced was often beyond her conscious capabilities in both style and content. Some of it was particularly psychic, such as the references to specific events and facts from my own past (e.g., the knowledge about my father and my son), as well as from her own. She had knowledge that she had never had access to, or accumulated, in her present life. This knowledge, as well as the whole experience, was alien to her culture and upbringing and contrary to many of her beliefs.

- What about Jung’s idea of the collective unconscious, a reservoir of all human memory and experience that could somehow be tapped into? Divergent cultures often contain similar symbols, even in dreams. According to Jung, the collective unconscious was not personally acquired but “inherited” somehow in the brain structure. It includes motives and images that spring anew in every culture, without relying upon historical tradition or dissemination. I thought Catherine’s memories were too specific to be explained by Jung’s concept. She did not reveal symbols and universal images or motives. She related detailed descriptions of specific people and places. Jung’s ideas seemed too vague. And there was still the in-between state to consider. All in all, reincarnation made the most sense.

- The answer came from the poet Master. “Patience and timing … everything comes when it must come. A life cannot be rushed, cannot be worked on a schedule as so many people want it to be. We must accept what comes to us at a given time, and not ask for more. But life is endless, so we never die; we were never really born. We just pass through different phases. There is no end. Humans have many dimensions. But time is not as we see time, but rather in lessons that are learned.” ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1058))

What did you learn from that lifetime?” “I learned about hate … senseless killing … misdirected hate … people who hate and they don’t know why. We are driven to it … by the evil, when we are in physical state….” “Is there a higher duty than duty to the country? Some thing that could have prevented you from killing? Even if you were ordered? A duty to yourself?” “Yes. …” But she did not elaborate. “Are you waiting for something now?” “Yes … I’m waiting to go into a state of renewal. I must wait. They will come for me … they will come….” “Good. I would like to talk with them when they come.” We waited for several more minutes.

- abruptly her voice was loud and husky, and the original Master Spirit, not the poet Master, was speaking. “You were correct in assuming this is the proper treatment for those in the physical state. You must eradicate the fears from their minds. It is a waste of energy when fear is present. It stifles them from fulfilling what they were sent here to fulfill. Take your cues from your surroundings. They must first be put into a level very, very deep … where they no longer can feel their body. Then you can reach them. It’s only on the surface … that the troubles lie. Deep within their soul, where the ideas are created, that is where you must reach them. “Energy … everything is energy. So much is wasted. The mountains … inside the mountain it is quiet; it is calm at the center. But on the outside is where the trouble lies. Humans can only see the outside, but you can go much deeper. You have to see the volcano. To do it you have to go deep inside. “To be in physical state is abnormal. When you are in spiritual state, that is natural to you. When we are sent back, it’s like being sent back to something we do not know. It will take us longer. In the spirit world you have to wait, and then you are renewed. There is a state of renewal. It’s a dimension like the other dimensions, and you have almost succeeded in reaching that state….” ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1136))

- This caught me by surprise. How could I be approaching the state of renewal? “I have almost reached it?” I asked incredulously. “Yes. You know so much more than the others. You understand so much more. Be patient with them. They don’t have the knowledge that you have. Spirits will be sent back to help you. But you are correct in what you are doing … continue. This energy must not be wasted. You must get rid of the fear. That will be the greatest weapon you have….” ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1146))

- She answered in a whisper, from the perspective of her superconscious mind. “Oh, yes … many spirits. They only come when they want to. They come … when they want to. We are all spirits. But others … some are in physical state and others are in a period of renewal. And others are guardians. But we all go there. We have been guardians, too.” “Why do we come back to learn? Why can’t we learn as spirits?” “Those are different levels of learning, and we must learn some of them in the flesh. We must feel the pain. When you’re a spirit you feel no pain. It is a period of ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1171))

- renewal. Your soul is being renewed. When you’re in physical state in the flesh, you can feel pain; you can hurt. In spiritual form you do not feel. There is only happiness, a sense of well-being. But it’s a renewal period for … us. The interaction between people in the spiritual form is different. When you are in physical state … you can experience relationships.” ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1175))

- As I gradually accepted and believed the messages, my life became simpler and more satisfying. There was no need to play games, to pretend, to act out roles, or to be other than what I was. Relationships became more honest and direct. Family life was less confusing and more relaxed. My reluctance to share the wisdom that had been given to me through Catherine began to diminish. Surprisingly, most people were very interested and wanted to know more. Many told me of their very private experiences of parapsychological events, whether ESP, déjà vu, out-of-body experiences, past-life dreams, or others. Many had never even told their spouses about these experiences. People were almost uniformly afraid that, by sharing their experiences, others, even their own families and therapists, would consider them odd or strange. Yet these parapsychological events are fairly common, much more frequent than people realize. It is only the reluctance to tell others about psychic occurrences that makes them ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1226))

- The week passed quickly. I had listened over and over again to the tape of last week’s session. How was I approaching the state of renewal? I did not feel particularly enlightened. And now spirits would be sent back to help me. But what was I supposed to do? When would I find out? Would I be up to the task? I knew I must wait and be patient. I remembered the words of the poet Master. “Patience and timing … everything comes when it must come…. Everything will be clear to you in time. But you must have a chance to digest the knowledge that we have given to you already.” So I would wait. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1244))

Hypnosis was a powerful tool, not only providing access to the most remote, hidden areas of the mind, but also allowing a much more detailed memory.

- “Yes,” she agreed again, and her voice became deep and husky, “it is unimportant that our bodies get burned in fires if we don’t need them. …” A Master Spirit had shed an entirely different perspective on the dream. I was surprised at this sudden entrance, and I could only parrot back the thought. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1323))

- “We don’t need our bodies?” “No. We go through so many stages when we’re here. We shed a baby body, go into a child’s, from child to an adult, an adult into old age. Why shouldn’t we go one step beyond and shed the adult body and go on to a spiritual plane? That is what we do. We don’t just stop growing; we continue to grow. When we get to the spiritual plane, we keep growing there, too. We go through different stages of development. When we arrive, we’re burned out. We have to go through a renewal stage, a learning stage, and a stage of decision. We decide when we want to return, where, and for what reasons. Some choose not to come back. They choose to go on to another stage of development. And they stay in spirit form … some for longer than others before they return. It is all growth and learning … continuous growth. Our body is just a vehicle for us while we’re here. It is our soul and our spirit that last forever.” I did not recognize the voice or style. A “new” Master was speaking, and speaking of important knowledge. I wanted to know more about these spiritual realms. “Is learning in the physical state faster? Are there reasons that people don’t all stay in the spiritual state?” “No. Learning in the spiritual state is much faster, far accelerated from that in the physical state. But we ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1325))

- choose what we need to learn. If we need to come back to work through a relationship, we come back. If we are finished with that, we go on. In spiritual form you can always contact those that are in physical state if you choose to. But only if there is importance there … if you have to tell them something that they must know.” “How do you make contact? How does the message come through?” To my surprise, Catherine answered. Her whisper was faster and firmer. “Sometimes you can appear before that person … and look the same way you did when you were here. Other times you just make a mental contact. Sometimes the messages are cryptic, but most often the person knows what it pertains to. They understand. It’s mind-to-mind contact.” I spoke to Catherine. “The knowledge that you have now, this information, this wisdom, which is very important … why is it not accessible to you when you are awake and in the physical state?” “I guess I wouldn’t understand it. I’m not capable of understanding it.” “Then, perhaps I can teach you to understand it, so that it doesn’t frighten you, and so that you learn.” “Yes.” “When you hear the voices of the Masters, they say things similar to what you are telling me now. You must share a great deal of information.” I was intrigued at the wisdom she possessed when she was in this state. “Yes,” she replied simply. “And this comes from your own mind?” “But they have put it there.” So she gave the credit to the Masters. “Yes,” I acknowledged. “How do I best communicate it back to you so that you grow and lose your fears?” “You have already done that,” she answered softly. She was right; her fears were nearly gone. Once the hypnotic regressions had begun, her clinical progress had been incredibly rapid. “What lessons do you need to learn now? What is the most important thing you can learn during this lifetime so that you can continue to grow and prosper?” “Trust,” she answered… ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1335))

- her strengths. She knew the areas that needed attention and work, and she knew what to do to improve matters. The only problem was that these insights needed to reach her conscious mind and needed to be applied to her waking life. Superconscious insight was fascinating, but by itself it was not enough to transform her life. “Who are these people to break away from?” I asked. She paused. “I am afraid of Becky. I’m afraid of Stuart … that somehow harm will come to me … from them.” “Can you break away from that?” “Not completely, but from some of their ideas, yes. Stuart is trying to keep me in prison, and he is succeeding. He knows that I’m afraid. He knows I’m afraid to be away from him, and he uses that knowledge to keep me with him.” “And Becky?” “She’s constantly trying to break down my faith in the people that I have faith in. When I see good, she sees evil. And she tries to plant those seeds in my mind. I’m learning to trust … people I should trust, but she fills me with doubts about them. And that’s… ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1354))

- The awake Catherine did not possess these attributes. It was my task to bridge the gulf. Her dramatic clinical improvement meant that some of this was seeping through. I attempted more bridge-building. “Who can you trust?” I asked. “Think about it. Who are the people you can trust and learn from and get closer to. Who are they?” “I can trust you,” she whispered. I knew this, but I knew she needed to trust people in her everyday life even more. “Yes, you can. You are close to me, but you must get closer to other people in your life, too, people who can be with you more than I can.” I wanted her to be complete and independent, not dependent on me. “I can trust my sister. I don’t know the others. I can trust Stuart, but only to a certain extent. He does care about me, but he’s confused. In his confusion he unknowingly is doing me harm.” “Yes, it is true. Is there another man that you can trust?” “I can trust Robert,” she answered. He was another physician in the hospital. They were good… ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1364))

- Could they also know facts from the future? If so, could we share this foreknowledge? A thousand questions burst into my mind. “When you find contact with your superconscious mind, like now, and have this wisdom, do you also develop abilities in the psychic realm? Is it possible for you to look into the future? We have done much in the past.” “That is possible,” she conceded, “but I see nothing now.” “It is possible?” I echoed. “I believe so.” “Can you do this without being frightened? Can you go into the future and obtain information of a neutral sort that will not be frightening to you? Can you see the future?” Her answer was swift. “I don’t see that. They will not allow it.” I knew she meant the Masters. “Are they around you now?” “Yes.” “Are they talking to you?” “No. They monitor everything.” So, being monitored, she was not permitted to peer into the future. Perhaps we had nothing to… ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1373))

Do you know him?” “No, I don’t believe so.” “But he protects you from danger?” “Yes.” “The Masters….” “I don’t see them.” “Sometimes they have messages for me, messages that help you and help me. Are these messages available to you even when they’re not speaking? Do they put thoughts in your mind?” “Yes.” “Do they monitor how far you can go? What you can remember?” “Yes.” “So there is a purpose in this explanation of lifetimes….” “Yes.” “… For you and for me … to teach us. To bring us the disappearance of fear.” “There are many ways of communication. They choose many … to show that they do exist.” Whether Catherine was hearing their voices, visualizing past images and vistas,… ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1383))

- by providing insights and knowledge, to help us become godlike through wisdom. “Do you know why they have chosen you….” “No.” “… to be a channel?” This was a delicate question, since the awake Catherine could not even listen to the tapes. “No,” she softly whispered. “Does it frighten you?” “Sometimes.” “And other times not?” “Yes.” “It can be reassuring,” I added. “We know now that we are eternal, so we lose our fear of death.” “Yes,” she agreed. She paused. “I must learn to trust.” She had returned to her lifetime’s major lesson. “When I’m told something, I must learn to trust what I am told … when the person is knowledgeable.” “Certainly there are people not to trust,” I added. “Yes, but I’m confused. And the people I know I should trust, I fight against that feeling. And I… ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1391))

- “Was there more to gather from that time? Do you know?” “Yes.” “Would it be worthwhile to go back now and explore it?” “It won’t come back now. There are so many things in a lifetime … there is so much knowledge to attain … from each lifetime. Yes, we must explore, but it won’t come back now.” So I turned again to her troubled relationship with her father. “Your relationship with your father is another area, one that has affected you deeply in this life.” “Yes,” she answered simply. “It is another area to explore yet, too. You’ve had much to learn from this relationship. Compare it to the little boy in the Ukraine who lost his father at an early age. And this loss did not happen to you this time. And yet, having your father here, even though certain hardships were less …” “Was more of a burden,” she concluded. “Thoughts …” she added, “thoughts….” “What thoughts?” I sensed she was in a new area. “About the… ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1400))

- my choking, about the possibility of me choking when they did the surgery on my throat.” I remembered Catherine’s vocal cord surgery, which was performed just a few months before her first appointment with me. She had been anxious prior to the surgery, but she was absolutely terrified upon awakening in the recovery room. It had taken the nursing staff hours to calm her. Now it appeared that what was said by the surgeons during the operation, during the time she was under deep anesthesia, had precipitated her terror. My mind flipped back to medical school and my surgery rotation. I remembered the casual conversations during operations, while the patients were anesthetized. I remembered the jokes, the cursing, the arguments, and the surgeons’ temper tantrums. What had the patients heard, at a subconscious level? How much registered to affect their thoughts and emotions, their fears and anxieties, after they awakened? Was the postoperative course, the patient’s very recovery from the surgery, influenced positively or negatively by the remarks made during the operation? Had anyone… ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1410))

- “But you did.” “Yes. That’s why I had all the problems.” After today’s session, Catherine no longer had any fear of swallowing or choking. It was as simple as that. “All the anixety …” she continued, “I thought I would choke.” “Do you feel free?” I asked. “Yes. You can reverse what they did.” “Can I?” “Yes. You are. … They should be very careful of what they say. I remember it now. They put a tube in my throat. And then I couldn’t talk afterward to tell them anything.” “Now you re free…. You did hear them.” “Yes, I heard them talk….” She fell silent for a minute or two, then began to turn her head from side to side. She seemed to be listening to something. “You seem to be hearing messages. Do you know where that message came from? I was hoping the Masters would appear.” “Someone told me” was her cryptic answer. “Somebody was speaking to you?” “But they’re gone… ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1420))

- “No.” “Okay,” I conceded, “but the message about the anesthesia was very important for you. That was the source of your choking.” “It was important for you, not me,” she retorted. Her answer reverberated through my mind. She would be cured of the terror of choking, yet this revelation was nevertheless more important for me than for her. I was the one doing the healing. Her simple answer contained many levels of meaning. I felt that if I truly understood these levels, these resonating octaves of meanings, I would advance a quantum leap into the understanding of human relationships.

- Catherine was becoming increasingly psychic, and apparently so was I. I could hear my old psychiatry professors talking about transference and countertransference reactions in therapeutic relationships. Transference is the patient’s projection of feelings, thoughts, and wishes onto the therapist, who represents someone from the patient’s past. Countertransference is the reverse, the therapist’s unconscious emotional reactions to the patient. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007EDYNAO&location=1445))

I was mildly surprised that she, a practical businesswoman, readily accepted this knowledge and wanted to learn more. I gave her books to read, and she did so avidly. She arranged for and took a course with Carole and me in kabbalah, the Jewish mystical writings that are centuries old. Reincarnation and the in-between planes are basic tenets of kabbalistic literature, yet most modern-day Jews are unaware of this.

You were in a red uniform … thrown from a horse…. There is a gold ring … with a lion’s head … used as an insignia.” There was no more. I interpreted the poet Master’s statement to mean there would be no more revelations through Catherine’s hypnosis, and this was indeed the case. We were to have no further sessions. Her cure had been complete, and I had learned all that I could through the regressions. The rest, what lay in the future, I had to learn through my own intuition.
