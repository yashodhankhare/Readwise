- This revisitation points to a larger age-old theme: Good times breed laxity, laxity breeds unreliable numbers, and ultimately, unreliable numbers bring about bad times. This simple rhythm of markets is as predictable as human avarice. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=108))

- Rather than heralding a new era, the shift in attitudes toward risk exposed a neglected but hugely important attribute of all markets, past, present and future: namely, the role of psychology. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=162))

- To find the last time investors were that ebullient, we must go back to just before the crash of 1929. Then, financial journals were filled with eerily similar arguments that a new economy was dawning that would cause stock prices to rise for the foreseeable future. Given the enormous impact of the cheap automobile, mass production manufacturing, and the proliferation of radio, the telephone, and electrification, it is arguable that the 1920s had a better claim on the concept of a new economy than did the technophiles of seven decades later. (Indeed, the development of mass production techniques in the 1920s later made possible the U.S. mobilization in World War II.) No matter, “old economy” realities exposed the vulnerabilities of that “new economy” as well. This pattern of generational forgetting may be obvious and simple, but it has profound effects. Markets affect investor psychology, but investor psychology also affects markets. Basically, we all live three lives: our life, the life of our parents, and that of our children. Events within our experience, particularly our youth, remain the most visceral in memory, but events that lie beyond the horizon of these generations tend to be more abstract, if only because they don’t have an immediate connection to our lives. I might warn a Young Turk incessantly about the horrors of a crash or bad market, but I will not likely make an impression on one who hasn’t lived through the experience. If societies can forget and then repeat the horrors of war, they can certainly forget the temporary ruination of a stock market crash. Try to imagine the role of psychology in your investing. What were you thinking or feeling when you bought or sold a stock or bond? What prompted you to pick up the telephone? To what degree did mood and intuition, as opposed to analysis, affect the decision? What assumptions caused you to pay heed to a particular piece of information? Why did you weigh one piece of information over another? What facts did you include in your decision? Then try to imagine what the person on the other side of the trade was thinking. Investors tend to forget that whoever buys the stock you sell or sells the stock you buy has undertaken his own analysis of the situation. There is a genius on one side of every trade and a dolt on the other, but which is which does not become clear until much later.

- Despite all the evidence that markets float atop an ocean of beliefs and moods, conventional economics minimizes the role of psychology in freely functioning markets. This is odd, since both market seers and economists talk endlessly about the mood of markets. When they sit down to analyze a stock, sector, or market, however, they tend to look upon markets as rational and efficient. This outlook is very dangerous for one’s economic health. It’s even more dangerous to misconstrue success in the markets for rational analysis. Those most adept at profiting from a particular market are often least likely to notice when the game is over, and probably the least psychologically prepared to profit from the successor market.

- But the market has even crueler twists. It’s not sufficient that a player figure out when the game has changed. When a market shifts, it usually requires the investor to adopt a psychological stance anathema to the precepts upon which he built his earlier success. It will not be easy for the apostles of the so-called new economy to nimbly adjust should the market decide that quaint old-economy obsessions such as earnings and dividends are important after all. The message is that mood or investor psychology is as important to markets as is information. It requires tremendous discipline to apply this understanding to one’s behavior.

- For most people, the most dangerous self-delusion is that even a falling market will not affect their stocks, which they bought out of a canny understanding of value. Piling delusion upon delusion, most people also believe that no matter what happens, they will be able to get out at or near the top of the market.

- When a stock plummets, money vanishes. The $400 billion in market value of Cisco that disappeared during the Nasdaq swoon and the $70 billion decline in Enron market value represent money that has disappeared, except for the tiny fraction of that amount that went into the pockets of those who sold as the stock plummeted. The market capitalization that vanished has real effects: There is that much less money to finance investment or consumption.

- Lost along with this money is the crucial element of trust. The lesson for the public has been that neither companies nor the analysts supposedly assessing those companies’ prospects can be trusted. Nor can people always trust the independent accountants who certify company reports. They cannot even always trust the financial cops of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to catch cheaters in a timely fashion. When people don’t trust the information or institutions of a market, they won’t buy its products. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=229))

- The market meltdown was a reminder to all of us that no one has a system to beat the market. This is not to say that no one can beat the market, but an investor should greet any promise of automatic returns with great skepticism. Most investors know this, but still, people love systems.

- When you have made a massive bet and markets start to go against you, it is always a good idea to reexamine the assumptions behind your strategy. Even if you are still convinced you are right, however, it is difficult to resist the temptation to cut losses or take a quick profit. In such circumstances, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that ultimately the market does reflect value, even if it may seem to lose its marbles for unbearably long periods. Investors must decide how long they are willing to wait. Investors also have to be alert to changes in the market that could change their original assumptions. We may not have an efficient market, but we do have a pretty efficient market. Or as the legendary value investor Benjamin Graham once put it: In the short term, the market is like a voting machine, reflecting a company’s popularity, but over the long term, it more resembles a weighing machine, reflecting a company’s true value. This is the aspect of markets that allows the great investors to outdistance those who are lucky. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=258))

- Why should the market be any more perfect than the very human emotions and calculations that drive it? Investors overreact, and so do markets. Investors get swept up in moods, and so do markets. And this interplay creates investment opportunities. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=271))

- If Congress continues to follow my imaginary script, it will eventually get around to asking why the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was repealed in 1999, allowing banks to underwrite and sell stocks. Glass-Steagall had outlawed this egregious conflict of interest—banks selling their customers stocks that the banks themselves were underwriting—that had contributed to the crash of 1929. This practice is legal once again—and a dangerous temptation. Think of it: A bank is nervous about the $100 million it loaned to windmill.com. If it underwrites an IPO (initial public offering) for the dotcom, it gets its loan back, plus a fee for the underwriting, and if the bank’s customers buy the stock, it also gets a commission. Very tempting indeed. Still, I doubt we will see Congress reviewing the repeal of Glass-Steagall, since it was by Congress’s own action (with Alan Greenspan’s enthusiastic endorsement) that the law was repealed.

- No bell rings when the market changes its emphasis. The market integrates several different time scales into a cacophony—or a symphony, depending on the temperament of the listener. Prices respond to the news of the day, to technical factors pertaining to particular stocks; they respond to political events here and abroad; they respond to market players trying to guess how people will react to events; they respond to technological change and shifts in trade policies; they respond to long-term phenomena, such as the aging of baby boomers and trends in capital spending. At one moment, the mood in one aspect of the market may be ebullient, while elsewhere it is morose; the entire market gets swept along by a tide of emotion. Intellectual measures often seem not to apply. But when has reason ever prevailed in markets? Only in the eye of the beholder, when the market agrees with his analysis. Yes, there are periods when prices seem to closely track world events, but the timing of when prices respond to events can be profoundly affected by psychology. In the markets, timing can be the difference between a windfall and bankruptcy. As the great British economist and philosopher John Maynard Keynes noted, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. To ignore the psychological component of the flux of the markets is to miss seeing the elephant in the room. I would not bet heavily on the longevity of someone who walks into a room with his eyes closed when an elephant is in there, too. Psychology plays a role in all the events of the market, from the actions of the day trader riding the momentum of Internet stocks to the broad long-term shifts that become obvious and undeniable only over time.

- You can’t understand economics without understanding philosophy and history. John Maynard Keynes was the greatest economist of the last century, and he was primarily a philosopher; so was Adam Smith, the greatest economist of the eighteenth century. If intelligence is the ability to integrate, creativity is the ability to integrate information from seemingly unconnected sources, and a measure of both abilities is necessary for long-term success in the markets.

- Archaeologists have their specialties, and one of the curiosities of the field is that those who specialize in one aspect of antiquity tend to be blind to anything else. Archaeologists who look for pottery sherds will not see coins, and, conversely, those who look for coins will not find sherds. Same dig, but those sifting the soils see entirely different things. So it is with markets. Most people believe that markets are driven primarily by economic factors, and that psychology plays a minor role. I take the position that markets are driven by both psychological and economic factors. I owe a great debt to economists for their inability to acknowledge the degree to which psychology moves markets. (In this sense, it’s unfortunate that economics now seems to be embracing psychology. I suspect that economists will always retain the illusion that numbers can capture mood.) My approach to the markets has been to take a long-term perspective, a natural predilection that has on numerous occasions saved me from getting lost in the froth of daily events. I admit that there is something self-serving in this strategy as well. Long-term goals postpone days of reckoning, and if you can identify a goal that takes a lifetime to achieve, you won’t be disappointed.

Indeed, for a man who did not want his son to go to Wall Street, he was inordinately involved in encouraging me to learn how to value companies as businesses and investments.

- His distaste for Wall Street also derived from his distaste for what he saw as an inherent conflict of interest in the dual role of investment bankers, who supposedly served the interests both of companies issuing stock and the customers who bought the securities. Neither he nor I, for that matter, ever met anyone who thought that caught between the interests of the two groups, investment bankers would lean over backward to help the customers.

- In economics Dad was ahead of his time, but his attitudes toward women were more suited to the nineteenth century. He was against the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the vote. He reasoned that it would double the number of voters without improving the quality of elections. When Warren G. Harding, one of America’s least distinguished presidents, was elected in 1920 in the first national contest after the ratification of the amendment, Dad took this as a complete vindication of his views. He talked about it for years afterward. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=493))

- Dad knew that capital goods expenditures led to profits for the economy as a whole. He also believed that capital spending rose and fell in long cycles, and that the fading cycle of capital spending foretold weaker profits for companies in the years to come. Scholars still argue about the causes of the Great Depression, but few would argue that the prosperity of the 1920s could have continued if capital spending declined. Therein lies one of the remarkable similarities between the 1920s and the 1990s: Then, as now, capital spending fueled profits and growth, and then, as now, investors and companies took on more and more debt, believing that this growth would continue forever because the fundamental rules had changed. Now, as then, the capital spending boom inevitably ran its course, exposing the hollow-ness of any thoughts that we had entered a “new economy.” ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=517))

- Dad taught me to look for patterns in trading. He told me that in down markets, buyers tend to push stocks up in the morning, while those looking to sell would hold out and then dump at the end of the day, hoping to get a higher price—a piece of wisdom subsequently confirmed by a number of technical analysts. I learned from him how to plow through monthly reports on insiders’ stock trades for advance warning signs that something was afoot in a company. Of course, the next task was to find out what was afoot. Dad, as always, looking for ways to tie his economic theories to daily life, did not give me an allowance; instead, he gave me a “salary” that varied according to how well my research paid off in the market and how well I did at school.

- More recently, the late economist Hyman Minsky gave some credit to Dad’s work, particularly his ability to see how prosperity leads to its own decline by ultimately producing speculative excesses. As good times roll along, people lose sight of risk (and often justify the change with talk of a “new economy”). Eventually, these excesses lead to a point where people can’t meet their obligations, and the bad times begin. From his vantage point in the hereafter, Dad would be shocked at the lack of social progress. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=561))

- For his part, Dad sold all his war-related stocks at the outset and bought shares of retail companies, particularly chains and department stores, such as National Department Stores, Interstate Department Stores, and Federated Department Stores, which did spectacularly well. His reasoning was that there would be no market for war-related materials after the war was over, but there would be huge demand for retail products from consumers flush with war profits, who had not had the opportunity to buy goods during the war because of rationing.

- The unexpected turns of stocks during World War II offered a lesson about a fundamental frailty in forecasts of the market and the economy. All we can ever do is look at the past to predict the future, but life is dynamic and constantly changing, so the assumptions governing predictions are bound to be wrong. Instead, Dad tried to look at the situation structurally: Given new circumstances, where were profits likely to flow? What companies were well positioned to take advantage of the situation, and what were they worth? Essentially, Dad was engaged in value investing, the approach first described by Benjamin Graham and then followed by his student Warren Buffett. In some respects, all investing is value investing. Anyone who buys a stock has some picture of what the company might be worth at some future time. The question is whether the expected returns are sufficiently greater than risk-free investments, such as Treasury bonds, to warrant taking some risk. Everybody works this out over time, and that risk premium varies with the mood of a particular period. In the 1930s, the expectation of a 15 percent return would have wowed investors; during the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s, the same return was regarded as humdrum.

- The logic of this analysis was that stocks are inherently more risky than bonds and thus should provide holders with a “risk premium.” This premium would compensate for the fact that bonds have a guaranteed price at maturity, that bonds must pay their coupon (a dividend is discretionary), and that bonds have a higher claim on the assets of a company in the event of bankruptcy. It also shows that nobody then worried about inflation. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=681))

- Value investing is an approach to stocks that is as close as it gets to a golden rule. After all, an analyst researching a stock is only trying to estimate what the underlying company will be worth to an individual owner at some point in the future. It’s a simple idea but devilishly difficult in the execution, because so many variables weigh upon a company’s future value. An evaluation of its assets depends on management, conditions at that moment, and the market’s attitude toward the industry. Management changes, personality clashes, changing technologies and tastes, access to credit, foreign and domestic competition, economic factors such as interest rates, access to raw materials or talent, changes in tax policy—the list goes on and on—all affect an appraisal of value. Typically, analysts evaluating the future prospects of a company look at its past. Where else can they look, after all? And yet, even if they had a perfect snapshot of the past, they would be mistaken to assume that the conditions that held in the past will hold in the present or future. Perhaps this is why the more recent notion of a perfect market—an “efficient market”—in which current prices reflect all available information, is so seductive. A perfect market assumes that prices reflect all prior research ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=808))

- at that point. Those who believe in an efficient market, and I am not one of them, believe that stocks can never be underpriced or markets overvalued. They say you can’t beat an efficient market—all you need to do is put your money into an index fund. The problem is that all the stocks may be reasonably priced compared to one another, but the whole market may be too high or too low. The market may not be efficient, but over time it is pretty efficient, especially at grinding down the egos of those who succumb to the temptation of seeing profits as certification of their own genius. In an uncertain world, governed by probabilities rather than rules, the only constant may be that the more time that passes, the more probable it becomes that you will at some point encounter an improbable event.

- As had been the case with West Virginia Coal and Coke, once Scheuer controlled Eastern Gas, he had the company continue to buy its own stock. Later, when I got to know Scheuer, he remarked to me, “Leon, if you want a stock to behave, keep buying it.” Decades later, Scheuer’s insight was confirmed by an academic study of 1,239 companies, which found that those that reduced the supply of stock through repurchases outperformed otherwise equivalent companies that did not. Unfortunately, this lesson has been overlearned and also turned to more short-sighted purposes. Buying-in shares can be a smart tactic if a company is flush with cash and the stock is in the tank. As Warren Buffett once noted, who wouldn’t jump at the chance to buy out his partners at 50 cents on the dollar? And of course, as the number of shares being traded shrinks, the percentage of a controlling stake expands. Buying-in shares is another thing entirely, however, when shares are selling at or near historic highs and priced at many times earnings.

In recent years, more and more companies, most notably IBM, have used aggressive share purchases as a device to prop up per-share earnings. If a company buys-in more shares than it issues in a year, per-share earnings rise even if total earnings remain flat, because earnings are being divided by fewer shares.

- Getty and Scheuer were two patient schemers who operated on a grand scale. Deconstructing their plays opened my eyes to the extraordinary discipline, strategic imagination, and perseverance required to unlock and capture the riches lying hidden in the balance sheets of neglected or undervalued corporations. In one sense, these two men were the opposite of accounting wizards at Enron and WorldCom. At these two companies and many other companies today, executives use their understanding of balance sheets to convince the public that revenues are there when they are not and that expenses are not there when they are. Getty and Scheuer, whose reward derived from buying assets at severe discounts, had no interest in prettying up numbers. The two men also offered insight into some of the grating personality traits that often accompany success in the market. But I did not need this particular lesson, since I could find difficult and driven people simply by looking around the Oppenheimer offices.

If he did, I would ask him about his last trade and why he bought or sold a particular stock. Every now and then, a would-be analyst would surprise me with highly original thinking. Over time, we assembled a highly regarded research department. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1000))

- Nevertheless, Gene Fenton was brilliant. Next to my father, Gene probably had as much influence on my thinking about the nature of markets as anyone. He viewed the market as a football game in which there were 22 players on the field and 80,000 in the stands. Although only the players on the field were moving, everyone had a stake in what they did. Moreover, the action on the field affected the mood in the stands, and the mood in the stands affected the action on the field.

- Fenton laid out his ideas in his master’s thesis—probably one of the few master’s theses in history that could be used by investors. Fenton saw a cycle to markets that ran through five phases: accumulation, appreciation, exhaustion, distribution, and liquidation. He analyzed the interplay of ten factors—such as leading indicators, Fed policy on interest rates, credit expansion and contraction, institutional and individual investors—and the role they played in each phase. Fenton was interested in the psychology of markets. Such thinking was highly unusual for that time. In particular, he looked at the perversely counterintuitive role of the mood of market observers. Put simply, at major turning points in markets, market prognosticators are generally wrong. Times of universal pessimism usually represent remarkable buying opportunities, and times of buoyant optimism are often a clarion call to sell. The simple reason, now well known and endlessly repeated in the press, is that in times of universal optimism, most potential buyers of stock are already in the market, whereas in times of deep pessimism, investors are out of stocks, or are trying to get out. This doesn’t mean that the professionals are always wrong, but if they are right for a protracted period, they have convinced their followers to invest or sell, and thus must be wrong in the end. I was intrigued by Fenton’s thinking. As I pondered this paradox, I could identify a psychological mechanism that brings about a market turn. For example, declining stock prices can ultimately cause people to panic and sell. But the moment they join the panic and sell stock, they also relieve the cause of their fears and become potential buyers. The act of selling removes the anxiety, restores equanimity, and gives them the cash to buy. It sounds simple, but as anyone who has invested knows, moods are powerful, and it is not so easy to buy in a period of profound pessimism, even if your mind tells you a particular moment could be the buying opportunity of the decade. For one thing, all your friends are doing the opposite, For another, pessimism is based on plausible arguments. Although you might tell yourself the bottom is at hand, you can never know that for a fact. Playing the market is not a science, and the market is not characterized by causal relationships. In the midst of a panic, you might tell yourself that it is highly unlikely for the market to fall further, but you can never say it is inconceivable. However tiny, this room for doubt is wide enough to permit fears to flow in and paralyze the investor. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1037))

- Danny was smart, smart enough to sell short in a bull market and still make money. He was one of the first analysts I knew to realize that certain numbers have a mystique in the stock market. Once a stock rises above $10 a share, he argued, it had a better chance to continue rising than if it remained below $10. This principle has nothing to do with the number, of course, but everything to do with psychology. Prices above $10 seem to reassure investors about the stability of the stock and the solidity of the company. Many institutions have rules prohibiting them from buying stocks below $10, the premise being that stocks selling below $10 are highly speculative. We know today that the price of the stock has nothing to do with the fundamental business or its risk, but somehow in the minds of investors, $10 was chosen as the arbitrary figure for stability.

- Marni knew I had been toying with the idea of starting a mutual fund in which the management fee was based on performance and not on the fund’s assets. This fee arrangement seemed fair, since the fund manager’s rewards were determined by what the fund delivered to investors. (When taking a flight, you want the pilot on the plane for the ride.) During the party, Marni pointed out a young man to me. “See that man over there,” she said with the satisfaction of someone who knows she is delivering highly interesting news. “He just set up a fund with a performance fee.” I immediately asked to meet him, and Marni introduced me to Edmund Delaney, then a senior partner at the law firm of Palmer, Serles, Delaney, Shaw & Pomeroy. He was a cultured man whose courtly manner took the edge off his skills as an insistent and persuasive debater. I warmed to him immediately. He said that indeed he had set up a fund in which the managers were paid based on the fund’s performance. “You can’t do that,” I protested. He countered, “We just did.” It was the Leon B. Allen Fund.

At one point, we adopted a selling line that we viewed as bold, promising to invest anywhere in the free world where opportunity exceeded risk, only to discover that this promise scared, rather than attracted, potential customers.

- Apart from performance, a key element in the success of the fund was the sales force. Psychology played a role here as well. In the mid- 1960s, I read an article in the Harvard Business Review about a Princeton-based psychologist named Herbert Greenberg, who claimed he could predict a salesman’s ability through a psychological exam that probed traits such as ego, empathy, and the ability to get along with other people. I invited him to our offices. (Observant fellow that I am, I never noticed he was blind until an associate pointed it out to me after he left). All the partners took the test under pseudonyms. Mine was Art Loft, and the results suggested that I had top potential as a salesman but limited ability as a manager. Among the more trenchant observations about me in the report was this: “He is quite impulsive, does not tolerate detail too well.” ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1303))

- Sustaining performance over time is very, very hard. Faced with a choice of disappointing their shareholders or their conscience, many made the same choice: They cheated. The scale of corruption uncovered in America’s balance sheets and investment banks has been impressive, but the overreachers who cooked the books are hardy perennials that pop up whenever opportunity presents itself during the long march of financial folly. Overreachers are an endemic part of the financial landscape—they are like weeds in summer. I’ve encountered many overreachers in my career. The trick is to recognize early on both their brilliance and their fatal flaws. Markets offer the biggest opportunity for rewards to those who are willing to take the most risk. You might ignore an opportunity to earn 0.3 percent on an investment, but if you can leverage your investment 100 times through borrowing, you can earn 30 percent on your capital. Of course, if you do this, you had better be right. For this reason, the market draws highly competitive people with an appetite for risk. Leverage may not change the odds of a given investment, but it makes the consequences much more stomach-turning if the investment turns bad and you end up with a pile of debt. The market attracts a particularly aggressive breed of people and then puts them in situations where the very aggressiveness that fostered their success will sometimes hustle them off the stage. The market first rewards overreachers and then punishes them later. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1368))

- The problem was the classic bind of borrowing short and lending long. If short-term rates rose rapidly, a bank would find itself hemorrhaging money, because its cost to borrow money would rise while its income from long-term loans and mortgages remained fixed. Gene had a solution to that, and it was brilliant. Its one flaw derived directly from Gene’s Achilles heel—overreaching. The idea was the variable-rate mortgage (now universally known as the adjustable-rate mortgage). A mortgage that allowed the lender to adjust rates on mortgages as short-term interest rates fluctuated would protect the S&L from being caught in an interest rate squeeze. It was a brilliant idea that Gene got half right: In Gene’s innovation, the variable rate of the mortgage would only go up. Despite this, I liked Gene’s analysis of the promise of S&Ls, and when he solicited me as a potential investor, I agreed to become his partner. We considered the investment too risky for the firm, but several other partners also bought in. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1401))

- Just before the IOS collapse, I had one other encounter with an overreacher from the Cornfeld solar system. This was John King, then a larger-than-life billionaire oil man who had built his fortune selling limited partnerships in oil exploration ventures. I’d agreed to this meeting at the urging of Arthur Lipper. Lipper, a restless and creative intellect, had made his name by establishing performance measures for mutual funds (a business later acquired by his brother, Michael). Arthur hated doing anything that someone else was doing. He was always imagining new financial gambits—among them securitizing the S&P 500, an idea that was eventually developed by others. Among his far-flung ventures were an ice-skating rink in Singapore (which lies on the equator), vineyards in Australia, and a radio station that served the Gulf states on the Arabian peninsula (and whose most popular program was a reading of the Israeli casualty lists in the 1967 war, or so he told us). Lipper mentioned that King was looking for financing and urged me to visit the oil man in Denver. I showed up at King’s address and was ushered into an enormous office where this imposing giant sat beneath a portrait of a charging elephant—the image of a billionaire oil man right out of Central Casting. King laid out his proposition. He offered to sell me 20,000 acres of Arctic oil land, a small fraction of the 20 million acres held by King Arctic Investments, which in turn was largely held by Cornfeld’s Fund of Funds. Moreover, if I agreed to the price of $8 per acre, King said I would not have to put up any money for eight years. Why would anyone want to sell a property and not receive money? I had come armed with the answer. Shortly before visiting Denver, I had run into Louis Weeks, the retired chief geologist for Standard Oil. There are good geologists and great geologists, and Weeks certainly qualified as the latter. He combined scientific rigor and imagination. For years, Weeks presented one of the most popular programs on the Armed Forces Radio Network in Europe, in which he explained that modern geology confirmed the order of events in the Book of Genesis. Light into darkness, water onto land—that was exactly the sequence of events. With his background, Weeks had superb instincts for the value of oil properties, and I asked him about the likely value of King’s Arctic land. After some thought, he came back with the figure: about 50 cents per acre. With that piece of information, I knew King and his buddy Bernie Cornfeld were in the last act of their financial drama. Had I purchased the acreage, King could have used that sale to mark up the value of his remaining millions of acres, and Cornfeld could maintain the illusion that the Arctic lands were still worth the $8 per acre that Cornfeld had paid for them, thus misleading the public as to the value of the assets in his Fund of Funds. When I called King to demur from the investment, I casually asked him whether he was worried… ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1461))

Anybody who began investing in the 1990s, and had the expectation that stocks regularly outperform all other investments, should spend a moment pondering those two numbers and two dates. For example, say you were forty-eight years old in 1964 and put $100,000 into the Dow on the last day of 1964 with instructions that dividends be reinvested, confident that you would have a nice nest egg when you retired at age sixty-five. When the last day of 1981 rolled around, your money would be worth statistically less than your initial investment because of the moribund market and the depredations of inflation.

- I had some experience with the coal business from the 1950s as part of my efforts to decode the mysterious maneuverings of Sy Scheuer in his takeover of West Virginia Coal and Coke. I recalled that the real opportunity back then was not so much in mining the fossil fuel but in moving it. Our transportation analyst, Bert Fingerhut, had urged us to explore opportunities in railroads—one of the best ways of transporting large amounts of coal through great stretches of America. Thus I approached Schlesinger after his speech to ask him whether the United States had the railroad capacity to move the amounts of coal he was talking about. His answer, a qualified maybe, suggested that railroads were going to be operating at full capacity if his energy plan was enacted. This simple question led to one of the most interesting, complicated, and profitable investments of my career. It took years for this deal to come to fruition, but the bankruptcy of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad presented a golden opportunity. Bankruptcies have often been extraordinarily profitable because they scare away many investors, which means their stock and bond prices are low.

- When a company declares bankruptcy, all the cards are thrown down and a new hand can be drawn. Many institutions tend to dump their holdings (some of them are not even permitted to hold paper in bankrupt companies), which drives prices below a company’s underlying value. Analysts tend to drop coverage as well, contributing to the confusion and hence the opportunity. The small commissions on bonds make them unattractive for many firms to trade, contributing to illiquidity and, again, further expanding opportunities for investors.

Although the Milwaukee Road eventually proved to be an enormously profitable investment, it took far longer to come to fruition than my partners and I initially estimated. Moreover, it became profitable for reasons very different from the analysis that prompted our original investment, which had been spurred by our hunch that the railroad business would rebound.

- One lesson from the Milwaukee Road experience was the importance of understanding the time frame of an investment. It was several years before the bonds and stock moved at all significantly, which meant that for a while the investment was a drag on our investors’ return on capital. Negative impact of this sort can create pressures to bail out prematurely from a promising investment because there are always other opportunities competing for attention. Also at play is the phenomenon of “investor fatigue,” to which all investors, including Jack Nash and me, are susceptible. After years of meetings and slogging through details with little to show for it, many investors want to flee and be rid of the problem forever. As the market began to recognize that the Milwaukee Road had some value, another intriguing problem emerged. When a stock has tripled, the question for investors is whether to lock in gains or stay with it because there is additional upside potential. Some take a conservative approach. When criticized for selling his investments too early, the celebrated financier André Meyer of Lazard Frères replied, “Nobody ever went broke doubling his money.” He’s right, but from my point of view, the proper perspective on an investment is not what you have made so far, but rather the risk and reward ratio at any given point. The price you paid for a stock is irrelevant. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1729))

- At Oppenheimer, there were always those who wanted to lock in profits, but we tended to stay with investments sometimes long after they doubled; conversely, we sometimes held on to a position too long when the stock was falling. We constantly reevaluated our position, of course, but as long as we believed that the returns by holding the stock measurably outweighed the risks, we were inclined to hold it. That also reduced our taxes. We didn’t sell a single share of the Milwaukee Road until long after Canadian Pacific bought the railroad. Even good investments will hit a period when market forces drive the value of a stock far below or far above what the investor thinks it’s worth, but at any point the investor must evaluate the potential gains and perils and the time frame involved. This principle brings us back to psychology, because the interplay of thoughts and feelings that causes someone to buy or sell at any particular moment may involve factors far afield from the health of the company or the state of the market.

- LATE IN LIFE, I finally got around to reading the great nineteenth-century novel War and Peace. By all accounts, Tolstoy was meticulous in his research for this masterpiece. He visited battlefields and talked to soldiers who had participated in the Napoleonic campaign. From these conversations, he became convinced that the generals who planned the battles never really knew what was happening during the fog of war. Later, however, they would get together and reconstruct what had occurred, perhaps airbrushing or omitting the occasional embarrassing detail. This retrospective retelling would then become the official version of the campaign. All well and good—except for the minor point that the official version might be far afield of reality and thus a poor guide for generals preparing for future campaigns. So it is with markets. Consider the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). Anyone with the most cursory interest in ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=1986))

- finance will recall the brief transit and violent collapse of this giant hedge fund in the fall of 1998. We had dissolved Odyssey Partners the year before, and I had the luxury of being a spectator rather than a participant. Like the generals observed by Tolstoy, the principals in this failed financial campaign somehow survived a great crisis without acknowledging a central lesson of their downfall: that the basic assumption of their strategy did not accord with reality. Moreover, in both cases, unanticipated human factors played a crucial role in obviating their carefully thought-through plans. Like the ship Titanic, LTCM seemed unsinkable. Staffed by legendary traders and armed with an approach to the markets based on the specialized knowledge of Nobel Prize-winning economists, LTCM attracted a roster of backers that included the savviest veterans on Wall Street. After all, who better to find opportunities in the market for various options than Myron Scholes and Richard Merton, who just a year before LTCM’s collapse shared the Nobel Prize in economics for their pioneering role in describing the pricing of derivatives—the very financial instruments in which the hedge fund invested? Uniting all the principals of the hedge fund were a supreme self-confidence and a belief in the efficiency and rationality of markets. Initially, it seemed as though LTCM’s rocket scientists had in fact uncovered the philosopher’s stone. The fund made astonishing amounts of money. A dollar invested in 1994 was worth $2.40 just two years later. Major banks clamored to invest, but, acting prudently, John Meriwether and his partners had the discipline to resist the billions offered. They wanted the minimum amount of capital necessary to back up their trades, reasoning that the smaller the capital base, the larger the returns on capital. Indeed, the partners did so many things right that the story takes on a tragic dimension. The principals limited outside capital, but many of them invested all their accumulated wealth in LTCM. This willingness to take personal risk stands in refreshing contrast to all too many Wall Street players. It wasn’t greed or venality that brought down LTCM, but hubris, which blinded them to warning signals that their intricate strategy that churned and balanced hundreds of billions of dollars worth of financial instruments were based on faulty assumptions about the behavior of markets.

- LTCM’s strategy was to identify inefficiencies in the pricing of various options that companies, banks, and other large financial institutions use to reduce their exposure to risk in the markets. Over the years, Wall Street has introduced a variety of options—calls, puts, interest rate swaps—that give risk-averse investors the opportunity to sell off their potential gains or otherwise limit their potential losses in the currency, bond, and stock markets. A large company like IBM might limit or hedge its risk in the international currency markets by selling to someone else the opportunity to gain from wild movements of some of its positions in yen, euros, or pounds. The invisible hand of the market would price these derivatives (so-called because they are “derived” from another financial instrument) as various parties made their judgments of what they were willing to pay, given the risks and rewards each option entailed. As these financial products proliferated, however, occasional… ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2012))

- inefficiency. This strategy is called “arbitrage,” and such transactions are viewed as virtually risk-free. Moreover, the arbitrage itself helps to eliminate the inefficiency (selling overpriced options helps drive the price down, while buying underpriced options creates upward pressure), and thus arbitrage is often defended as a policing mechanism that targets and removes unwarranted price discrepancies in the marketplace. (It is interesting to note that any profitable market strategy, no matter how obviously it is driven by greed, always is deemed good for society by those who reap the profits.) The catch is that the price discrepancies targeted by arbitrageurs are often tiny: In one of LTCM’s transactions, the premium on one bond that was slightly easier to sell than its equivalent was 0.3 percent, or roughly 1/300th of the value of the bond. To realize any meaningful gains on this transaction, an arbitrageur would have to buy a massive amount of bonds, and even then the… ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2021))

- on the money you invested; a 99 percent margin would yield a 27 percent return. LTCM did even better than that. As masterminds of risk management, their strategists developed intricate ways to balance and otherwise offset risks to the point that they were able to borrow virtually all the money needed. When collateral was needed for a transaction, it would be transferred, but then moved again as soon as it could be freed up to support some other trade. At its height, the hedge fund had $4.72 billion of capital that served as collateral for $125 billion in bonds. And beyond this, LTCM controlled a portfolio of $1.25 trillion in derivatives. The enterprise was like one of those balancing acts perfected by the Chinese circus in which several acrobats maintain a precarious balance on the shoulders of one stout man nervously riding a bicycle. LTCM was able to convince its bankers and partners to finance this astonishing leverage because the risk in each… ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2030))

- returns for the fund’s investors. Moreover, had the LTCM crowd been content with smaller returns, the collapse of August 1998 might never have happened. But Meriwether, Scholes, and Merton were so confident about their formulas and risk assessments that they felt comfortable pushing this contraption to the limit, almost daring the market to prove them wrong. The aggressiveness of the fund ultimately tested the assumptions upon which LTCM had built its $1.25 trillion magical kingdom of transactions. The fund’s chutzpah was in its extraordinary leverage, which turned a risk-free strategy into a highly risky bet on the nature of the markets by serving as a giant magnifier. What ultimately did in LTCM was the difference between the reality of markets and the abstract model upon which the fund based its strategy. Magnified a thousand times, these subtle differences emerged as monsters.

- available information about a stock or bond. Should prices veer out of whack, normal forces will quickly restore equilibrium. This belief in efficient markets led LTCM’s strategists to adopt certain assumptions: that they would easily be able to sell their securities (an aspect of markets called liquidity) and that different markets did not move together except when there was some real link between particular securities. Moreover, in the vast markets for currency futures, the strategists paid insufficient heed to the impact their actions had on the market. This last oversight proved to be crucial. Not only did LTCM have an enormous portfolio, but other Wall Street firms were also involved in derivatives arbitrage, including a few firms that explicitly sought to emulate LTCM’s trades. Often LTCM and like-minded hedge funds controlled large percentages of a particular bond issue or financial instrument. But in a larger sense, LTCM failed to… ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2048))

- The LTCM strategists’ delusion was to watch a market go mad and fail to appreciate the degree to which their own actions contributed to the insanity. The crisis began in earnest on August 19, when Russia defaulted on payments on its bonds, and then placed a one-month moratorium on local bank payments on foreign currency contracts. In theory, LTCM should have been insulated against such events, since its Russian exposure was small, and in any event, its entire portfolio was balanced and hedged. Moreover, depleted and impoverished, Russia was an insignificant player on the world financial stage. ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2071))

- After the Russian decision, the cascade began when three European banks, feeling squeezed, took advantage of bankruptcy laws to halt payments to a large hedge fund appropriately named High-Risk Opportunities. As Nicholas Dunbar tells the story in his book on LTCM, Inventing Money, this forced the hedge fund into liquidation, which in turn increased the volatility of the markets. Most hedge funds involved in arbitrage used the same tools as LTCM to manage risks, which meant that as volatility increased beyond its expected range, many firms had to either find more capital or prune their portfolios. Since the easiest way to find additional capital was to liquidate the most marketable positions, the increased volatility set off a chain reaction of selling as funds started dumping the same derivatives into an already saturated market. With dozens of hedge funds trying to flee the markets, the selling pressure sent prices haywire around the world. Erratic prices served only to increase volatility in the marketplace, forcing more funds to breach their tolerances of risk and sell, which further aggravated the madness. Although LTCM’s managers refused to acknowledge it, the market was rubbing their noses in their cherished assumptions. One assumption was that the price of a given security was independent of the prices of unrelated securities. With a diverse portfolio of investments, one bad apple shouldn’t affect the others. But this diversity was an illusion. Apart from the copycat aspects of the market in the summer of 1998, even within LTCM there were linkages among different parts of its portfolio simply because trouble in the firm’s capital position forced LTCM to liquidate its diverse positions to remain solvent. These positions may have been unrelated in other respects, but they had a common link to the financial stability of LTCM and other like-minded funds. LTCM’s Chinese acrobatic show was beginning to wobble as its frantic bicyclist maneuvered to keep the acrobats from falling on his head. In August alone, the fund lost roughly 45 percent of its capital, an event that the fund’s risk analysis predicted should happen no more than once in the history of Western civilization. It shouldn’t be unduly difficult to draw a conclusion about whether LTCM was extremely unlucky, or whether its managers misunderstood the nature of the risk.

- In September 1998, as in October 1987, liquidity, the lifeblood of markets, was disappearing from the exchanges. But psychology remained a crucial element. Since Argentina was not going bankrupt—at least not then—buyers should have been seizing the opportunity for quick profits as prices plunged. But as in 1987, buyers were nowhere to be found. To some degree, the reasons were practical—as LTCM teetered toward insolvency, no ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2111))

- one knew how the forced liquidation of its enormous portfolio would affect prices, and traders in its markets pulled back. But everybody else pulled back as well, and some of the world’s most liquid markets began to freeze up. It’s natural for people to pull back in times of uncertainty, but this largely emotional reaction has enormous effects on markets. In normal times, trades proceed smoothly in part because those on each side of the trade have confidence that the other party will honor its part of the bargain. But when markets go into a dive, one can’t be sure whether the company on the other side of the deal is solvent. And once doubts enter the imagination, they spread rapidly and can quickly become paralyzing. The result is that anxiety about the health of the system makes those with capital extraordinarily fearful. Buyers become reluctant to enter the market, and lenders pull back as well. Worried that the global financial system would completely freeze solid unless something was done to restore confidence in the markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve prodded a consortium of banks and investment houses to take over LTCM. This move allayed fears that the world’s fragile markets ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2114))

LTCM’s losses alone came to $4.6 billion, and the temporary damage to the world’s markets reached trillions of dollars. The bailout may have prevented a complete collapse of the global financial order, but some markets still have not recovered from the scary events of the summer of 1998. What can be made of this chain of events? First and foremost, never have more than one Nobel laureate economist as a partner in a hedge fund. LTCM had two. Having had one Nobel prize winner as a limited partner over the years, I can say that had our firm followed his advice, we too might have lost a lot of money. The LTCM episode also revealed that the market was not sufficiently efficient to justify the models devised by LTCM.

- The collective madness that seized investors in the 1990s provides the most persuasive evidence of the role of psychology in markets. After all, this was a period during which even the most sophisticated investors willingly suspended their sense of disbelief and, perhaps even more astonishing, dismissed facts and figures staring them in the face. It helps to review the 1980s to put the bubble period in perspective. The crash of 1987 may have wiped out many people and a number of firms, but the markets quickly recovered from the 22 percent drop on October 19 and even finished the year with a gain. The Federal Reserve flooded the banks with liquidity and restored confidence in a system that was perilously close to meltdown the day after the crash, but the lingering effect of this timely intervention was to leave investors believing that the markets were less risky than was the case. The crash itself was written off as the result of an unforeseen and one-time catastrophe caused by computer selling in a risk-balancing strategy called portfolio insurance. As computer programs shorted stocks, driving down prices, fewer buyers showed up to buy the stocks being shorted, putting further downward pressure on prices.

- Many investors who bought immediately after the crash made a good deal of money in the next year or two, which helped make the saying “buy the dips” the stock market mantra of the 1990s. Throughout the past decade, whenever markets hit a bad patch, some wise old hand would appear on television and patiently explain to nervous viewers that in the long run stocks have always outperformed other investments. Then the markets would soar to new highs, breeding armies of smug new converts to the buy-the-dips religion. One tenet of this new faith was that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department had learned the lessons of the Depression and now had the tools to prevent panics from progressing to full-fledged depressions. Thus, even before the Internet came along, investors were encouraged to believe that stocks were not as risky as their long-term price movements would suggest. Corporations and investment bankers were delighted with the public’s newfound belief in the infallibility of Alan Greenspan and the automatic road to wealth promised by the stock markets. Suddenly, here was a huge population of investors willing to assume the risks inherent in stocks—through their purchases of mutual funds—and tie their fates to their employers’ fortunes by accepting payments into retirement accounts in the form of company stock. Who could argue, since the appreciation of most stocks was outpacing conservative investments by a country mile? Companies took advantage of this gullibility to shovel stocks into the accounts of their workers every way they could. Then came the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the notion of risk was seemingly consigned to the dustbin of history. The Internet famously promised a “new paradigm,” giving anyone with moxie access to global markets, promising consumers the power to “name your own price” for everything from airline tickets to groceries, and offering businesses the allure of fantastic productivity improvements in everything from dealing with suppliers to lowering the costs of sales. The old ways of valuing companies went out the window, as did the notion that stocks were inherently risky. A book called Dow 36,000 argued that even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed past 10,000, the market was vastly undervalued, since prices were discounted for more risk than was justified in an environment of low inflation and strong earnings growth. The authors (James Glassman and Kevin Hassett) maintained that equities carried no more risk than corporate bonds, and that as investors came to realize this, they would accept less return in dividend yields and bid up prices. To the authors, even the historically high price-earnings ratios of the late 1990s were ludicrously low. For a while, the data seemed to back up these arguments. The productivity surge in the late 1990s seemed to validate the claim that years of investment in computers and other information technologies was finally paying off. Internet companies were deemed exempt… ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2231))

- investors, management, and employee stock-option programs. Typically, insiders were allotted shares under lockup agreements that prohibited selling for periods ranging upward of six months. This temporary stock scarcity created the illusion of demand for a “hot” company. To put this in context, consider the brief life of a fictional (but typical) Internet company. Say that a few dotcom fanatics and I decided in December 1999 to form an Internet company to sell our patented tulip bulbs that glow in the dark. We give the company the ironic and suitably edgy name of Dimbulb.com (to disguise the fact that the founder is over seventy years old) and offer 10 million shares to the public at $10 a share.

Whenever an analyst recommends a stock, you can be sure that his firm’s salespeople have already been using the recommendation to push the stock. Thus there is usually a long line of people who have bought the stock before you, pushing up its price.

Yes, terrorists may now have even more motivation to strike again, but America was most vulnerable before the attack when our guard was down.

- By then, he was reluctant to sell. In his mind, $76, the stock’s high, had become its new base. As the months passed, the stock plunged through the $50s, $40s, and $30s. Still he didn’t sell. Instead, he blamed the decline on an “unwarranted reaction” (a common reason investors give for a decline in stock they own). His broker reinforced this, saying, “Who thought you’d ever get another chance to buy Intel at $30 a share?” Assigning any real significance to these prices is pure nonsense, but many people do it. People even view the same price differently, depending on a stock’s prior history. If you bought a stock at $1 and today it sells for $100, you would be happy about that—unless the price six months ago stood at $300. Then the $100 price today would be a calamity. Those who study the psychology of markets would say that in your mind you had revalued the stock when it jumped to $300. Similarly, when you think that a $30 price for Intel stock has some intrinsic meaning because of your broker’s suggestion, you are “anchoring,” or giving the price a special significance that is not related to the stock’s value. If you are reluctant to sell, you are typical of American investors, who sell their winners and keep their losers.

- Investors do this because the act of selling at a loss is an admission that they were wrong. I tend to do the opposite. I dislike watching my losers week after week, and if I sell them, I get a tax loss to offset capital gains. (Then again, the market may be telling me I’m wrong.) Some people sell their winners because they have been told they should “rebalance” their portfolio. But the issue is not rebalancing; rather, it’s balancing at every moment the risks and rewards of each investment. The market price of a stock in and of itself tells you nothing about its future There are many reasons why selling your winners and keeping your losers is a bad investment strategy, but no rule applies all the time. At the last peak of the bull market in March 2000, this might have been the best course of action, since winners would likely have been tech stocks and the losers value stocks. You would have captured the gains of irrational exuberance and kept the downtrodden value stocks that fared somewhat better in subsequent months. Richard Zeckhauser, a pioneer of behavioral economics at Harvard University, notes that our aversion to losses makes us dramatically distort probabilities. If a stock goes down, the odds that it will reverse itself are only one in four, but most people believe the stock will recover to the price at which they bought it. If my imaginary Internet biotech company Dimbulb.com had stayed in business long enough to have sales, it probably would not have met expectations the following year. The probability that it would have a good year following that bad year is only about 25 percent, but most investors who owned the stock typically would think the odds were much higher, closer to 50 percent or better. Many other quirks distort investor perceptions. Simple inertia stops people from acting on blindingly clear signals that they should sell or buy. There may be huge downside risks in a stock portfolio, but people typically discount the risks on stocks they own.

- Despite recent declines, there is still a good deal of buoyancy and optimism in the markets, more so than is warranted by a world situation in which all major economies have weakened and are burdened by debt and other legacies of the spending spree of the 1990s. We are seeing a profound shift in mood as the investing public veers from a focus on rewards to a preoccupation with risk. Even if the numbers matched up perfectly with some earlier period, the way people perceive those numbers will be different, a change that will play havoc with market forecasts based on past patterns. I suspect that this is a time when the game is changing. A bell certainly went off on September 11, but the changes were under way even before the terrorist attacks. Just as the late 1970s were a period when forces pushed for breaking up conglomerates to “liberate” value, I believe we are in for a protracted period when bonds will be favored over stocks. If we look at markets only for points of change (under the notion that if things remain stable, everything will be discounted), then this shift in the game presents an opportunity. Although we might understand that individual investors get caught up in the froth, what about the pros? The pros, it turns out, are subject to all the flaws of the individual investor. In the 1990s, the same financial tsunami that was drowning the individual investor also caught the mutual fund manager. The pros were taken in by the numbers that flowed from corporate press releases—numbers that were often inflated, and in some cases were downright lies.

- Unlike the individual investor, the fund manager has someone looking over his shoulder, and he is being judged in comparison with every other manager in his category and against the performance of the market as a whole. He also has a very short time horizon, since he will be judged by quarterly (if not monthly or daily) results. On the one hand, if he sells at the peak and the market then tanks, he is a hero for a day. On the other hand, if he sells and the market continues to rise, he will be fired. From a psychological standpoint, the easiest strategy is to stick with what he has in his portfolio. In his mind, the most likely scenario is that he is right and that the stocks he has selected will rise. But in 2000-2002 the market continued to fall. Earnings advisories and announcements make this problem worse. Analysts supposedly pore over these figures; they interview executives, customers, and competitors; they visit plants; they scour the academic and trade press for clues to trends in the sector. They then develop their estimate (until very recently, usually followed by a “strong buy” recommendation). Why is it, then, that earnings always seem to beat expectations by a penny or two a share? The answer is that analysts permit earnings “guidance,” which is controlled by the corporations, to influence their decisions, and they don’t take the long view. Here is what so often happens (I owe the example to Harvard’s Richard Zeckhauser): The analyst may study a bunch of numbers, but the most important factor shaping his thinking comes when he calls up the CEO of a company and says, “We’re thinking 27 cents per share earnings for the next quarter.” The CEO says, “I think that’s a little high” and waxes authoritatively about why (the reasons give a rationale, but in any business, the rationale will be incomplete), and the analyst settles on 25 cents. Everybody goes home happy—the analyst has a number and a good story, and the CEO has a number he knows he can beat.

- If there is a lesson in this saga, it is that good times produce bad numbers. Good times breed confidence, confidence breeds arrogance, and arrogance makes forecasts overly optimistic as executives begin to inhale their own perfume. Bad times then breed a caution that forces better disclosure, until good times return and, along with them, accounting laxity.

- My favorite futures contract—the eurodollar call—illustrates my thinking when I make a decision to buy or sell. Although the eurodollar call is an extremely arcane investment vehicle, my argument was simplicity itself. I came to it without using a computer or a calculator, just applying a bit of economics learned from Dad and my brother Jay.

- A eurodollar is simply a dollar that has been transported overseas, whether by U.S. firms paying for imported goods, by foreigners buying dollars as a stable currency for their savings, or by governments accumulating dollars to bolster the value of their monetary reserves. If you are on an airplane flying from New York to London and you have a dollar in your pocket, you can magically transform that dollar into a eurodollar by depositing it in a commercial bank when you land at Heathrow.

- The eurodollar market emerged in the 1970s when the United States was gripped by inflation and large sums of U.S. dollars moved offshore. The eurodollar market absorbed these stateless dollars so they could be traded easily without coming back to the United States and wreaking havoc with the world’s monetary standard. A eurodollar call is a contract (called an… ([Location 2606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2606))

- When you buy an option, the most you can lose is the price paid at the outset, which is a tiny fraction of the principal amount. For example, my cost for a $1 million ninety-day futures contract at a 6 percent interest rate would be only about $750. The price of the option is determined by the market, and it rises or falls with variations in interest rates. If interest rates move up and stay up—above 6 percent in this example—my option will expire worthless and I’m out the $750. But if interest rates move down, the price of the eurodollar future will rise, and I will benefit from enormous leverage. Should interest rates drop from 6 percent to 5 percent, my call would likely rise to the neighborhood of $2,500, more than three times what I paid for it. (My niece Julie at first was upset when she made money in this market, because she thought her gains had come at the expense of some widow or orphan. I explained that the steely-eyed bankers who played this market were quite capable of taking care of themselves.) For a large investor, the leverage on calls can be even greater. When traders know an investor is good for the money, they are willing to grant much greater margin, in which case my potential return could increase to as much as 16 to 1 if the market should turn in my direction. Even with the possibility of losing my initial investment, I judge the probability of a positive return at about 4 to 1, an… ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2609))

- interest rates to stimulate economies. There are exceptions, of course, and also many uncertainties, but it’s a reasonable assumption that interest rates will decline. Eurodollar call contracts provide added leverage because when interest rates are falling, short-term rates tend to fall more than long-term rates. These contracts have other beneficial features. Their leverage makes them highly volatile, and the value of the contract may rise or fall by as much as 12 percent in a single day. If the market starts moving in the direction of lower rates, prices may rise to attractive levels long before the expiration of my option, and I can sell off my position at a substantial profit. Further, the enormous size of the market insulates it somewhat from manipulation. On a typical day, more than 1 million 90-day contracts might trade, each with a nominal value of $1 million. Another plus is that the market is settled in cash. And because the settlement price is determined by an averaging of interest rates offered by thirteen major London banks, investors can have confidence that prices… ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2623))

- THERE IS NO SYSTEM to beat the market. The future is never a simple replay of the past. In 2001 pundits constantly repeated the mantra that the market always rallies some six months after two successive interest rate cuts, but eleven rate cuts and a year later, the stock market has remained in the doldrums. The market has a life of its own, and a lifetime of investing has allowed me to develop instincts for the ways in which the markets and the economy affect each other.

- Any judgment about the future is a judgment about probabilities. In this case, I have given a high probability to my forecast of continuing recession and a falling dollar—say, two out of three chances. This might not seem a high probability, but the world is a complicated place, and two-thirds is significantly better than chance. I’m not alone in this prediction, of course; numerous articles have appeared in the press casting doubt on the strength of the recovery and expressing worry about the possibility of a double-dip recession. If I’m right, it will not be because I’ve identified correlations between events such as interest rate cuts and economic activity, but because the causal factors first described by my father have proved themselves once again. This prediction derives directly from Dad’s economics and from his understanding of the role corporate profits play in the economy. Even though the markets have changed greatly in recent years, the degree to which people save and the degree to which companies invest in capital goods still affect profits the way they did almost a hundred years ago. If debt burdens and concerns for the future cause the net savings rate to rise to its historical average of 6-10 percent, the country will be ([Location 2765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2765))

- in deep trouble. Count on it. When the savings rate rises, my father observed, corporate profits fall. Today, each percentage point rise in the savings rate now decreases corporate profits by about $75 billion. This is not a correlation but a causal relationship that derives in some measure from the huge role that consumption plays in the U.S. economy. With total corporate profits amounting to about $680 billion a year ($860 billion at their peak during the boom years), a 1 percent increase in the savings rate would cut corporate profits by about 11 percent. (If corporate profits drop further, a 1 percent increase in the savings rate will carve an even bigger chunk out of earnings.) Currently, the savings rate is about 3 percent, not far above its recent lows. A rise by another 3 percent would knock about $225 billion from corporate profits, an enormous blow. Smaller profits lead to less investment, which means fewer new jobs and more layoffs. Reduced earnings also depress stock prices, and with sky-high expectations still built into stock prices, investors could be in for a nasty shock. If conditions remain constant, the resumption of the recession might finally stall or reverse the rise in real estate prices, which could have severe repercussions on both the economy and consumer psychology because so much of the average family’s wealth is tied up ([Location 2774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2774))

- The savings rate is just one of a number of ingredients that affect profits. The negative balance of trade also casts a shadow on our future. For a long time, Americans have been buying far more oil and goods from other countries than they have been selling. With the exception of one minuscule blip in the early 1990s, the U.S. balance of trade has been negative since 1981. Until the mid-1990s, this did not adversely affect American lives, since the foreigners who sold us goods were perfectly happy to invest their dollars in America, keeping our accounts in balance even if we were buying more than we were selling abroad. Since then, however, foreigners have been taking out more than they have been reinvesting, and that process began accelerating toward the end of 2001. The negative trade balance means that foreigners have been accumulating vast amounts of dollars. They hold these dollars by investing them in assets in the United States, by buying stocks, or by buying Treasury notes. Until 2001 they were rewarded for these investments ([Location 2806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ULOBUQ&location=2806))

Today these foreign holdings amount to about $2.2 trillion dollars, about 22 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. That is a lot of dollars—enough to make these foreign holders a major player in the fate of our economy. In this respect, our well-being is determined by the mood of these foreign holders. Unfortunately, they seem to be getting a bit nervous as they evaluate the economy to which they have entrusted their wealth.

- Moreover, foreign holders of dollars are a sophisticated lot. They realize that U.S. politicians have to manage the economy in order to be reelected. They also know that elected leaders will even pitch ideology overboard to pander to constituents. The otherwise conservative Bush administration’s decision to impose steel tariffs served as a timely reminder for those who might have forgotten this basic fact of American politics. Foreign investors also know that apart from tariffs, the biggest gift the government might give basic American businesses would be a weaker dollar, which would help boost their exports to other markets. While there will be a great temptation for the U.S. government to lower the value of the dollar, it will have little effect, because other countries will lower the value of their respective currencies.
