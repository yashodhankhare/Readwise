- There’s a joke I like that’s marginally relevant. An old married couple in their nineties contact a divorce lawyer, who pleads with them to stay together. “Why get divorced now after seventy years of marriage? Why not last it out? Why now?” The little old lady finally pipes up in a creaky voice: “We wanted to wait until the children were dead.” ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=167))

- For very big or very small numbers, so-called scientific notation is often clearer and easier to work with than standard notation and I’ll therefore sometimes use it. There’s nothing very tricky about it: 10N is 1 with N zeroes following it, so 104 is 10,000 and 109 is a billion. 10−N is 1 divided by 10N, so 10−4 is 1 divided by 10,000 or .0001 and 10−2 is one hundredth. 4 × 106 is 4 × 1,000,000 or 4,000,000; 5.3 × 108 is 5.3 × 100,000,000 or 530,000,000; 2 × 10−3 is 2 × 1/1,000 or .002; 3.4 × 10−7 is 3.4 × 1/10,000,000 or .00000034. Why don’t news magazines and newspapers make appropriate use of scientific notation in their stories? The notation is not nearly as arcane as many of the topics discussed in these media, and it’s considerably more useful than the abortive switch to the metric system about which so many boring articles were written. The expression 7.39842 × 1010 is more comprehensible and legible than seventy-three billion nine hundred and eighty-four million and two hundred thousand.

- The book of Genesis says of the Flood that “… all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered…” Taken literally, this seems to indicate that there were 10,000 to 20,000 feet of water on the surface of the earth, equivalent to more than half a billion cubic miles of liquid! Since, according to biblical accounts, it rained for forty days and forty nights, or for only 960 hours, the rain must have fallen at a rate of at least fifteen feet per hour, certainly enough to sink any aircraft carrier, much less an ark with thousands of animals on board. Determining internal inconsistencies such as these is one of the minor pleasures of numeracy. The point, however, is not that one should be perpetually analyzing numbers for their consistency and plausibility, but that, when necessary, information can be gleaned from the barest numerical facts, and claims can often ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=252))

- choice can be made in M different ways and some subsequent choice can be made in N different ways, then there are M × N different ways these choices can be made in succession. Thus, if a woman has five blouses and three skirts, then she has 5 × 3 = 15 choices of outfit, since each of the five blouses (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) can be worn with any of the three skirts (S1, S2, S3), to yield the following fifteen outfits: B1,S1; B1,S2; B1,S3; B2,S1; B2,S2; B2,S3; B3,S1; B3,S2; B3,S3; B4,S1; B4,S2; B4,S3; B5,S1; B5,S2; B5,S3. From a menu with four appetizers, seven entrees, and three desserts, a diner can design 4 × 7 × 3 = 84 different dinners, assuming he orders each course. Likewise, the number of possible outcomes when rolling a pair of dice is 6 × 6 = 36; any of the six numbers on the first die can be combined with any of the six numbers on the second die. The number of possible outcomes where the second die differs from the first is 6 × 5 = 30; any of the six numbers of the first die can be combined with any of the remaining five numbers on the second die. The number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice is 6 × 6 × 6 = 216. The number of outcomes in which the numbers on the three dice differ is 6 × 5 × 4 = 120. The principle is invaluable in calculating large numbers, such as the total number of telephones reachable without dialing an area code, which comes to roughly 8 × 106, or 8 million. The first position ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=330))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- can be filled by any one of eight digits (0 and 1 aren’t generally used in the first position), the second position by any one of the ten digits, and so on, up to the seventh position. (There are actually a few more constraints on the numbers and the positions they can fill, which brings the 8 million figure down somewhat.) Similarly, the number of possible license plates in a state whose plates all have two letters followed by four numbers is 262 × 104. If repetitions are not allowed, the number of possible plates is 26 × 25 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7. When the leaders of eight Western countries get together for the important business of a summit meeting—having their joint picture taken—there are 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320 different ways in which they can be lined up. Why? Out of these 40,320 ways, in how many would President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher be standing next to each other? To answer this, assume that Reagan and Thatcher are placed in a large burlap bag. These seven entities (the six remaining leaders and the bag) can be lined up in 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040 ways (invoking the multiplication… ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=341))

- Baskin-Robbins ice-cream parlors advertise thirty-one different flavors of ice cream. The number of possible triple-scoop cones without any repetition of flavors is therefore 31 × 30 × 29 = 26,970; any of the thirty-one flavors can be on top, any of the remaining thirty in the middle, and any of the remaining twenty-nine on the bottom. If we’re not interested in how the flavors are arranged on the cone but merely in how many three-flavored cones there are, we divide 26,970 by 6, to get 4,495 cones. The reason we divide by 6 is that there are 6 = 3 × 2 × 1 different ways to arrange the three flavors in, say, a strawberry-vanilla-chocolate cone: SVC, SCV, VSC, VCS, CVS, and CSV. Since the same can be said for any three-flavored cone, the number of such cones is (31 × 30 × 29)/(3 × 2 × 1) = 4,495.

- Note that the form of the number obtained is the same in all three examples: (32 × 30 × 29)/(3 × 2 × 1) different three-flavored ice-cream cones; (40 × 39 × 38 × 37 × 36 × 35)/(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) different ways to choose six numbers out of forty; and (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) different poker hands. Numbers obtained in this way are called combinatorial coefficients. They arise when we’re interested in the number of ways of choosing R elements out of N elements and we’re not interested in the order of the R elements chosen.

- An analogue of the multiplication principle can be used to calculate probabilities. If two events are independent in the sense that the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other, then the probability that they both occur is computed by multiplying the probabilities of the individual events. For example, the probability of obtaining two heads in two flips of a coin is ½ × ½ = ¼ since of the four equally likely possibilities—tail,tail; tail,head; head,tail; head,head—one is a pair of heads. For the same reason, the probability of five straight coin flips resulting in heads is (½)5 = 1⁄32 since one of the thirty-two equally likely possibilities is five consecutive heads. Since the probability that a roulette wheel will stop on red is 18⁄38, and since spins of a roulette wheel are independent, the probability the wheel will stop on red for five consecutive spins is (18⁄38)5 (or .024 – 2.4%). Similarly, given that the probability that someone chosen at random was not born in July is 11⁄12, and given that people’s birthdays are independent, the probability that none of twelve randomly selected people was born in July is (11⁄12)12 (or .352 – ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=389))

- The multiplication principle for probabilities is sufficient to determine the answer if we remember that the probability that an event doesn’t occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that it does (a 20 percent chance of rain implies an 80 percent chance of no rain).

- An important bit of background intimately connected to the multiplication principle and combinatorial coefficients is the binomial probability distribution. It arises whenever a procedure or trial may result in “success” or “failure” and one is interested in the probability of obtaining R successes in N trials. If 20 percent of all sodas dispensed by a vending machine overflow their cups, what is the probability that exactly three of the next ten will overflow? at most, three? If a family has five children, what is the probability that they will have exactly three girls? at least, three? If one-tenth of all people have a certain blood type, what is the probability that, of the next hundred people we randomly select, exactly eight will have the blood type in question? at most, eight?

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Let me derive the answer to the questions about the vending machine, 20 percent of whose sodas overflow their cups. The probability that the first three sodas overflow and the next seven do not is, by the multiplication principle for probability, (.2)3 × (.8)7. But there are many different ways for exactly three of the ten cups to overflow, each way having probability (.2)3 × (.8)7. It may be that only the last three cups overflow, or only the fourth, fifth, and ninth cups, and so on. Thus, since there are altogether (10 × 9 × 8)/(3 × 2 × 1) = 120 ways for us to pick three out of the ten cups (combinatorial coefficient), the probability of some collection of exactly three cups overflowing is 120 × (.2)3 × (.8)7. The probability of at most three cups overflowing is determined by finding the probability of exactly three cups overflowing, which we’ve done, and adding to it the probabilities of exactly two, one, and zero cups overflowing, which can be determined in a similar way. Happily, there are tables and good approximations which can be used to shorten these calculations. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=438))

- A man who travels a lot was concerned about the possibility of a bomb on board his plane. He determined the probability of this, found it to be low but not low enough for him, so now he always travels with a bomb in his suitcase. He reasons that the probability of two bombs being on board would be infinitesmal. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=475))

- The surprising likelihood of coincidence is illustrated by the following well-known result in probability. Since a year has 366 days (if you count February 29), there would have to be 367 people gathered together in order for us to be absolutely certain that at least two people in the group have the same birthday. Why? Now, what if we were content to be just 50 percent certain of this? That is, how many people would there have to be in a group in order for the probability to be half that at least two people in it have the same birthday? An initial guess might be 183, about half of 365. The surprising answer is that there need be only twenty-three. Stated differently, fully half of the time that twenty-three randomly selected people are gathered together, two or more of them will share a birthday.

- For readers unwilling to accept this on faith, here is a brief derivation. By the multiplication principle, the number of ways in which five dates can be chosen (allowing for repetitions) is (365 × 365 × 365 × 365 × 365). Of all these 3655 ways, however, only (365 × 364 × 363 × 362 × 361) are such that no two of the dates are the same; any of the 365 days can be chosen first, any of the remaining 364 can be chosen second, and so on. Thus, by dividing this latter product (365 × 364 × 363 × 362 × 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five people chosen at random will have no birthday in common. Now, if we subtract this probability from 1 (or from 100 percent if we’re dealing in percentages), we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common. A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields ½, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least two of twenty-three people will have a common birthday.

- The paradoxical conclusion is that it would be very unlikely for unlikely events not to occur.

- was in the tennis camp run by an acquaintance of the other’s. This sort of coincidence is surprisingly common. If we assume each of the approximately 200 million adults in the United States knows about 1,500 people, and that these 1,500 people are reasonably spread out around the country, then the probability is about one in a hundred that they will have an acquaintance in common, and more than ninety-nine in a hundred that they will be linked by a chain of two intermediates. We can be almost certain, then, given these assumptions, that two people chosen at random will be linked, as were the strangers on the business trip, by a chain of at most two intermediates. Whether they’ll run down the 1,500 or so people they each know (as well as the acquaintances of each of these 1,500) during their conversation and thus become aware of the two intermediates linking them is another, more dubious matter. These assumptions can be relaxed somewhat. Maybe the average adult knows fewer than 1,500 other adults, or, more likely, most of the people he or she does know live close by and are not spread about the country. Even in these cases, however, the probability of two randomly selected people being linked by two intermediates is unexpectedly high. A more empirical approach to coincidental meetings was taken by psychologist Stanley Milgram, who ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=536))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- gave each member of a randomly selected group of people a document and a (different) “target individual” to whom the document was to be transmitted. The directions were that each person was to send the document to the person he knew who was most likely to know the target individual, and that he was to direct that person to do the same, until the target individual was reached. Milgram found that the number of intermediate links ranged from two to ten, with five being the most common number. This study is more impressive, even if less spectacular, than the earlier a priori probability argument. It goes some way toward explaining how confidential information, rumors, and jokes percolate so rapidly through a population.

- A very simple numerical principle that’s sometimes of use in accounting for the certainty of a particular kind of coincidence is illustrated by the mailman who has twenty-one letters to distribute among twenty mailboxes. Since 21 is greater than 20, he can be sure, even without looking at the addresses, that at least one mailbox will get more than one letter. This bit of common sense, sometimes termed the pigeonhole or Dirichlet drawer principle, can occasionally be used to derive claims that are not so obvious.

- This filtering phenomenon is very widespread and manifests itself in many ways. Along almost any dimension one cares to choose, the average value of a large collection of measurements is about the same as the average value of a small collection, whereas the extreme value of a large collection is considerably more extreme than that of a small collection. For example, the average water level of a given river over a twenty-five-year period will be approximately the same as the average water level over a one-year period, but the worst flood over a twenty-five-year period is apt to be considerably higher than that over a one-year period. The average scientist in tiny Belgium will be comparable to the average scientist in the United States, even though the best scientist in the United States will in general be better than Belgium’s best (we ignore obvious complicating factors and definitional problems).

- Coincidences or extreme values catch the eye, but average or “expected” values are generally more informative. The expected value of a quantity is simply the average of its values weighted according to their probabilities. For example, if ¼ of the time a quantity equals 2, 1⁄3 of the time it equals 6, another 1⁄3 of the time it equals 15, and the remaining 1⁄12 of the time it equals 54, then its expected value equals 12. This is so since [12 = (2 × ¼) + (6 × 1⁄3) + (15 × 1⁄3) + (54 × 1⁄12)]. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=625))

- Descending to more pedestrian matters, let’s consider the firewalker’s practice of walking barefoot on hot wood coals. The practice has often been cited as an example of “mind over matter” and you don’t have to be innumerate to be impressed initially with such a feat (or with such feet). What makes this phenomenon less remarkable is the relatively little-known fact that dehydrated wood has an extremely low heat content and very poor heat conductivity. Just as it’s possible to put your hand into a hot oven without burning yourself as long as you don’t touch the metal oven racks, a person can walk quickly across burning wood coals without any serious harm to his feet. Of course, quasi-religious talk about mind control is more appealing than a discussion of heat content and conductivity. This, combined with the fact that these walkings take place in the evening to heighten the contrast between the cool night air and surrounding darkness and the hot glowing coals, accounts for the dramatic impact of firewalking.

- Astrology maintains that the gravitational attraction of the planets at the time of one’s birth somehow has an effect on one’s personality. This seems very difficult to swallow, for two reasons: (a) no physical or neurophysiological mechanism through which this gravitational (or other sort of) attraction is supposed to act is ever even hinted at, much less explained; and (b) the gravitational pull of the delivering obstetrician far outweighs that of the planet or ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1002))

- planets involved. Remember that the gravitational force an object exerts on a body—say, a newborn baby—is proportional to the object’s mass but inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the object from the body—in this case, the baby. Does this mean that fat obstetricians deliver babies that have one set of personality characteristics, and skinny ones deliver babies that have quite different characteristics? These deficiencies of astrological theory are less visible to the innumerate, who are not likely to concern themselves with mechanisms, and who are seldom interested in comparing magnitudes. Even without a comprehensible theoretical foundation, however, astrology would deserve respect if it worked, if there were some empirical support for the accuracy of its claims. But, alas, there is no correlation between the date of one’s birth and scores on any standard personality test. Experiments have been performed (recently, by Shawn Carlson at the University of California) in which astrologers have been given three anonymous personality profiles, one of which was the client’s. The client supplied all the relevant astrological data about his life (via questionnaire, not face-to-face) and the astrologer was required to pick the personality profile of the client. There were 116 clients altogether, and they were presented to thirty top (as judged by their peers) European and American astrologers. The result: the astrologers picked the correct personality profile for the clients about one out of three times, or no better than chance. John McGervey, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University, looked up the birth dates of more than 16,000 scientists listed in American Men of Science and 6,000 politicians listed in Who’s Who in American Politics and found the distribution of their signs was random, the signs uniformly distributed throughout the year. Bernard Silverman at Michigan State University obtained the records of 3,000 married couples in Michigan and found no correlation between their signs and astrologers’ predictions about compatible pairs of signs. Why, then, do so many people believe in astrology? One obvious reason is that people read into the generally vague astrological pronouncements almost anything they want to, and thus invest them with a truth which is not inherent in the pronouncements themselves. They’re also more likely to remember true “predictions,” overvalue coincidences, and ignore everything else. Other reasons are its age (of course, ritual murder and sacrifice are as old), its simplicity in principle and comforting complexity in practice, and its ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1005))

- flattering insistence on the connection between the starry vastness of the heavens and whether or not we’ll fall in love this month. One last reason, I would guess, is that during individual sessions astrologers pick up on clues about clients’ personalities from their facial expressions, mannerisms, body language, etc. Consider the famous case of Clever Hans, the horse who seemed to be able to count. His trainer would roll a die and ask him what number appeared on the die’s face. Hans would slowly paw the ground the appropriate number of times and then stop, much to the amazement of onlookers. What was not so noticeable, however, was that the trainer stood stone-still until the horse pawed the correct number of times, and then, consciously or not, stirred slightly, which caused Hans to stop. The horse was not the source of the answer but merely a reflection of the trainer’s knowledge of the answer. People often unwittingly play the role of trainer to astrologers who, like Hans, reflect their… ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1025))

- Medicine is a fertile area for pseudoscientific claims for a simple reason. Most diseases or conditions (a) improve by themselves; (b) are self-limiting; or (c) even if fatal, seldom follow a strictly downward spiral. In each case, intervention, no matter how worthless, can appear to be quite efficacious. This becomes clearer if you assume the point of view of a knowing practitioner of fraudulent medicine. To take advantage of the natural ups and downs of any disease (as well as of any placebo effect), it’s best to begin your worthless treatment when the patient is getting worse. In this way, anything that happens can more easily be attributed to your wonderful and probably expensive intervention. If the patient improves, you take credit; if he remains stable, your treatment stopped his downward course.

- One needn’t be a believer in any of the standard pseudosciences to make faulty claims and invalid inferences. Many mundane mistakes in reasoning can be traced to a shaky grasp of the notion of conditional probability. Unless the events A and B are independent, the probability of A is different from the probability of A given that B has occurred. What does this mean? To cite a simple example, the probability that a person chosen at random from the phone book is over 250 pounds is quite small. However, if it’s known somehow that the person chosen is over six feet four inches tall, then the conditional probability that he or she also weighs more than 250 ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1113))

- pounds is considerably higher. The probability of rolling a pair of dice and getting a 12 is 1⁄36. The conditional probability of getting a 12 when you know you have gotten at least an 11 is 1⁄3. (The outcomes could only be 6,6; 6,5; 5,6 and thus there’s one chance in three that the sum is 12, given that it’s at least 11.) A confusion between the probability of A given B and the probability of B given A is also quite common. A simple example: the conditional probability of having chosen a king card when it’s known that the card is a face card—a king, queen, or jack—is 1⁄3. However, the conditional probability that the card is a face card given that it’s a king is ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1118))

The conditional probability that someone speaks English, given that he or she is an American citizen, on the other hand, is probably about 19⁄20 or .95. Consider now a randomly selected family of four that is known to have at least one daughter. One possible way you may come to learn this: You’re in a town where every family includes a mother, father, and two children, and, picking a house at random, you are greeted by a girl. You’re told that in this town a daughter, if there is one, always answers the door. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1125))

- In any case, given that a family has at least one daughter, what is the conditional probability that it also has a son? The perhaps surprising answer is 2⁄3, since there are three equally likely possibilities—older boy, younger girl; older girl, younger boy; older girl, younger girl—and in two of them the family has a son. The fourth possibility—older boy, younger boy—is ruled out by the fact that a girl answered the door. By contrast, if you were simply to run into a girl on the street, the probability that her sibling is a boy would be ½.

- result, which has important implications for drug or AIDS testing. Assume that there is a test for cancer which is 98 percent accurate; i.e., if someone has cancer, the test will be positive 98 percent of the time, and if one doesn’t have it, the test will be negative 98 percent of the time. Assume further that .5 percent—one out of two hundred people—actually have cancer. Now imagine that you’ve taken the test and that your doctor somberly informs you that you’ve tested positive. The question is: How depressed should you be? The surprising answer is that you should be cautiously optimistic. To find out why, let’s look at the conditional probability of your having cancer, given that you’ve tested positive. Imagine that 10,000 tests for cancer are administered. Of these, how many are positive? On the average, 50 of these 10,000 people (.5 percent of 10,000) will have cancer, and so, since 98 percent of them will test positive, we will have 49 positive tests. Of the 9,950 cancerless people, 2 percent of them will test positive, for a total of 199 positive tests (.02 × 9,950 = 199). Thus, of the total of 248 positive tests (199 + 49 = 248), most (199) are false positives, and so the conditional probability of having cancer given that one tests positive is only 49/248, or about 20 percent! (This relatively low percentage is to be contrasted with the conditional probability that one tests positive, given that one has cancer, which by assumption is 98 percent.) This unexpected figure for a test that we assumed to be 98 percent accurate should give legislators pause when they contemplate instituting mandatory or widespread testing for drugs or AIDS or whatever. Many tests are less reliable: a recent article in The Wall Street Journal, for example, suggests that the well-known Pap test for cervical cancer is only 75 percent accurate. Lie-detection tests are notoriously inaccurate, and calculations similar to the above demonstrate why truthful people who flunk polygraph tests usually outnumber liars. To subject people who test positive to stigmas, especially when most of them may be false positives, is counterproductive and wrong.

- Confusing a conditional statement—if A, then B—with its converse—if B, then A—is a very common mistake. A slightly unusual version of it occurs when people reason that if X cures Y, then lack of X must cause Y. If the drug dopamine, e.g., brings about a decrease in the tremors of Parkinson’s disease, then lack of dopamine must cause tremors. If some other drug relieves the symptoms of schizophrenia, then an excess of it must cause schizophrenia. One is not as likely to make this mistake when the situation is more familiar. Not too many people believe that since aspirin cures headaches, lack of aspirin in the bloodstream must cause them.

- Our innate desire for meaning and pattern can lead us astray if we don’t remind ourselves of the ubiquity of coincidence, a ubiquity which is the consequence of our tendency to filter out the banal and impersonal, of our increasingly convoluted world, and, as some of the earlier examples showed, of the unexpected frequency of many kinds of coincidence. Belief in the necessary or even probable significance of coincidences is a psychological remnant of our simpler past. It constitutes a kind of psychological illusion to which innumerate people are particularly prone. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1429))

- by a value closer to the average or mean. Very intelligent people can be expected to have intelligent offspring, but in general the offspring will not be as intelligent as the parents. A similar tendency toward the average or mean holds for the children of very short parents, who are likely to be short, but not as short as their parents. If I throw twenty darts at a target and manage to hit the bull’s-eye eighteen times, the next time I throw twenty darts, I probably won’t do as well. This phenomenon leads to nonsense when people attribute the regression to the mean to some particular scientific law, rather than to the natural behavior of any random quantity. If a beginning pilot makes a very good landing, it’s likely that his next one will not be as impressive. Likewise, if his landing is very bumpy, then, by chance alone, his next one will likely be better. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman studied one such situation in which, after good landings, pilots were praised, whereas after bumpy landings, they were berated. The flight instructors mistakenly attributed the pilots’ deterioration to their praise of them, and likewise the pilots’… ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1434))

Though chance fluctuations play a very large role in the price of a stock or even of the market in general, especially in the short term, the price of a stock is not a completely random walk, with a constant probability (P) of going up and a complementary probability (1-P) of going down, independent of its past performance.… ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1450))

- Another example from Tversky and Kahneman: Choose between a sure $30,000 or an 80 percent chance of winning $40,000 and a 20 percent chance of winning nothing. Most people will take the $30,000 even though the average expected gain in the latter choice is $32,000 (40,000 × .8). What if the choices are either a sure loss of $30,000 or an 80 percent chance of losing $40,000 and a 20 percent chance of losing nothing? Here most people will take the chance of losing $40,000 in order to have a chance of avoiding any loss, even though the average expected loss in the latter choice is $32,000 (40,000 × .8). Tversky and Kahneman conclude that people tend to avoid risk when seeking gains, but choose risk to avoid losses. Of course, we needn’t resort to such clever examples to realize that how a question or statement is framed plays a big role in how someone responds to it. If you asked an average taxpayer how he feels about a 6 percent utility increase, he’d probably be amenable. If you asked his reaction to a $91 million hike in utility bills, he probably wouldn’t be. Saying that someone scored in the middle third of his class is more impressive than saying that he scored in the 37th percentile (better than 37 percent of his peers).

- A more common source of innumeracy than psychological illusions is what Sheila Tobias calls math anxiety. In Overcoming Math Anxiety she describes the block many people (especially women) have to any kind of mathematics, even arithmetic. The same people who can understand the subtlest emotional nuances in conversation, the most convoluted plots in literature, and the most intricate aspects of a legal case can’t seem to grasp the most basic elements of a mathematical demonstration. They seem to have no mathematical frame of reference and no basic understandings on which to build. They’re afraid. They’ve been intimidated by officious and sometimes sexist teachers and others who may themselves suffer from math anxiety. The infamous word problems terrify them, and they’re convinced that they’re dumb. They feel that there are mathematical minds and nonmathematical minds, and that the former always come up with answers instantaneously whereas the latter are helpless and hopeless. Not surprisingly, these feelings constitute a formidable block to numeracy. There are things to be done for those who suffer from them, however. One simple technique which works surprisingly well is to explain the problem clearly to someone else; if a person can sit still for this, he or she may think about ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1503))

The truism that one learns how to read by reading and how to write by writing extends to solving mathematical problems (and even to constructing mathematical proofs).

- Consider the following example, which illustrates the way we use mathematics but are not bound by it. Two men bet on a series of coin flips. They agree that the first to win six such flips will be awarded $100. The game, however, is interrupted after only eight flips, with the first man leading 5 to 3. The question is: How should the pot be divided? One might say that the first man should be awarded the full $100, because the bet was all or nothing and he was leading. Or one could reason instead that the first man should receive 5⁄8 of the pot and the other one the remaining 3⁄8 because the score was 5 to 3. Alternatively, it might be argued that because the probability of the first man’s going on to win can be computed to be 7⁄8 (the only way the second man could have won is by winning three flips in a row, a feat with probability 1⁄8 = ½ × ½ × ½), the first man should receive 7⁄8 of the pot to 1⁄8 for the second man. (This incidentally was Pascal’s solution to this, one of the first problems in probability theory.) Rationales for still other ways to apportion the money are possible. The point is that the criteria for deciding on any one of these divisions are nonmathematical. Mathematics can help determine the consequences of our assumptions and values, but we, not some mathematical divinity, are the origin of these assumptions and values.

- Several years ago, supermarkets began to use unit pricing (cents per pound, per fluid ounce, etc.) to give consumers a uniform scale with which to measure value. If the price of dog food and cake mix can be rationalized, why can’t some sort of rough “safety index” be devised which allows us to gauge how safe various activities, procedures, and illnesses are? What I’m suggesting is a kind of Richter scale which the media could use as a shorthand for indicating degrees of risk. Like the Richter scale, the proposed index would be logarithmic, so what follows is a little detour to review for the innumerate those dreaded monsters from high school algebra: logarithms. The logarithm of a number is simply the power to which 10 must be raised to equal the number in question. The logarithm of 100 is 2 because 102 = 100; the logarithm of 1,000 is 3 because 103 = 1,000; and the logarithm of 10,000 is 4 because 104 = 10,000. For numbers between powers of 10, the logarithm is between the two nearest powers of 10. For example, the logarithm of 700 is between 2, the logarithm of 100, and 3, the logarithm of 1,000; it happens to be about 2.8.

A Type I error occurs when a true hypothesis is rejected, and a Type II error occurs when a false hypothesis is accepted. Thus, if a large number of Corvettes from a car show drove through the region and we therefore accepted the false assumption that at least 15 percent of the cars in the region were Corvettes, we would be making a Type II error. On the other hand, if we didn’t realize that most of the Corvettes in the region weren’t driven but were kept in garages, then in rejecting the true assumption we would be making a Type I error.

We capture one hundred of them, mark them, and then let them go. After allowing them to disperse about the lake, we catch another hundred fish and see what fraction of them are marked. If eight of the hundred we capture are marked, then a reasonable estimate of the fraction of marked fish in the whole lake is 8 percent. Since this 8 percent is constituted by the one hundred fish we originally marked, the number of fish in the whole lake can be ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=1934))

Of course, care must be taken that the marked fish don’t die as a result of the marking, that they’re more or less uniformly distributed about the lake, that the marked ones aren’t only the slower or more gullible among the fish, etc. As a way to get a rough estimate, however, the capture-recapture method is effective, and of more generality than the fish example might suggest. Statistical analyses of works whose authorship is disputed (books of the Bible, The Federalist Papers, etc.) also depend on related clever ways of gleaning information from uncooperative (because dead) sources.

- Someone offers you a choice of two envelopes and tells you one has twice as much money in it as the other. You pick envelope A, open it, and find $100. Envelope B must, thus, have either $200 or $50. When the proposer permits you to change your mind, you figure you have $100 to gain and only $50 to lose by switching your choice, so you take envelope B instead. The question is: Why didn’t you choose B in the first place? It’s clear that no matter what amount of money was in the envelope originally chosen, given permission to change your mind, you would always do so and take the other envelope. Without any knowledge of the probability of there being various amounts of money in the envelopes, there is no way out of this impasse. Variations of it account for some of the “grass is always greener” mentality that frequently accompanies the release of statistics on income. One more game.

In fact, giving due weight to the fortuitous nature of the world is, I think, a mark of maturity and balance. Zealots, true believers, fanatics, and fundamentalists of all types seldom hold any truck with anything as wishy-washy as probability. May they all burn in hell for 1010 years (just kidding), or be forced to take a course in probability theory. In an increasingly complex world full of senseless coincidence, what’s required in many situations is not more facts—we’re inundated already—but a better command of known facts, and for this a course in probability is invaluable. Statistical tests and confidence intervals, the difference between cause and correlation, conditional probability, independence, and the multiplication principle, the art of estimating and the design of experiments, the notion of expected value and of a probability distribution, as well as the most common examples and counter-examples of all of the above, should be much more widely known. Probability, like logic, is not just for mathematicians anymore. It permeates our lives. ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058U7HTO&location=2202))

I’m distressed by a society which depends so completely on mathematics and science and yet seems so indifferent to the innumeracy and scientific illiteracy of so many of its citizens; with a military that spends more than one quarter of a trillion dollars each year on ever smarter weapons for ever more poorly educated soldiers; and with the media, which invariably become obsessed with this hostage on an airliner, or that baby who has fallen into a well, and seem insufficiently passionate when it comes to addressing problems such as urban crime, environmental deterioration, or poverty. I’m pained as well at the sham romanticism inherent in the trite phrase “coldly rational” (as if “warmly rational” were some kind of oxymoron); at the rampant silliness of astrology, parapsychology, and other pseudosciences; and at the belief that mathematics is an esoteric discipline with little relation or connection to the “real” world. Still, irritation with these matters was only part of my incentive. The discrepancies between our pretensions and reality are usually quite extensive, and since number and chance are among our ultimate reality principles, those who possess a keen grasp of these notions may see these discrepancies and incongruities with greater clarity and thus more easily become subject to feelings of absurdity.
