- This is a book about individual empowerment—recognizing the realities of your illness and taking steps to prevent episodes from occurring. It is my strong belief that people who do best with the disorder are those who have learned to recognize triggers for their mood cycles and learned how to minimize the impact of these triggers. They are people who stay close to their prescribed medication regimens and have trusting relationships with their physicians. They have regular therapists or go to support groups. They have come to appreciate their family members, who often have been the only ones to stand by them during and after illness episodes. They have learned as much as they can about the illness through books, articles, or conferences and regularly talk with and assist others who have the illness. They have learned to accept the disorder without limiting their personal goals because of it. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=155))

- As you can see, diagnoses that incorporate dimensions may lead to more fine-grained perceptions of how an illness takes shape in different people. For example, when you have major depression with only one or two manic symptoms, your doctor may think you have a bipolar spectrum disorder. You may not agree, but this is a debate worth having because it may affect medication choices, such as whether you should take antidepressants alone or in conjunction with a mood stabilizer.

- In fact, in the last two decades, bipolar disorder has suffered from “concept creep” (Haslan, 2016) as its boundaries have become broader and broader. Conditions that mimic bipolar symptoms, such as agitated depression or recurrent explosive outbursts in children (now called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, or DMDD), have been attributed too readily to bipolar disorder.

- Consider the emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In earlier editions of the book I stressed the importance of regular sleep–wake rhythms, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle also includes a regular exercise routine, a balanced diet, vitamins, and a balance of work (or volunteer) demands with time for friends or family. It might include time to meditate, write, or play or listen to music. These components of healthy living are of course recommended for everyone, but for those with bipolar disorder, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can mitigate the effects of stress on your risk of recurrences. In other words, the resilience view emphasizes factors that sustain us or contribute to our health rather than make us sick.

- I firmly believe that people with bipolar disorder lead happier lives when they do not carry the expectation that recovery means being free of all symptoms. A better definition of recovery is to lead a satisfying and fulfilling life despite symptoms of the illness and being able to work toward your life goals without sacrificing your mental or physical health.

- We’ve always known that bipolar disorder comes with problems in thinking, attention, planning, vigilance, memory, and problem solving, but only in the last decade has it become clear that cognitive impairment is present even between mood episodes, ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=308))

- during the “normal” or euthymic periods. We all have cognitive strengths and weaknesses, such as whether we routinely remember names, recall details of certain settings or conversations, or can attend to more than one thing at a time. But for those with bipolar disorder, the fact that cognitive functioning can affect mood and moods can affect cognition is particularly problematic. Cognitive problems and depression are the two strongest predictors of how people with bipolar disorder function in the community—such as whether they can hold a job, maintain relationships and friendships, or progress in school (Gitlin & Miklowitz, 2017). ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=309))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Moreover, people with bipolar disorder cannot always tell when their cognitive functioning is off-kilter. As a result, family members may get frustrated and blame you for not trying hard enough. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=326))

- So, if you are a teen or young adult who has just been diagnosed, being bipolar doesn’t necessarily mean you have to take the medicines you are currently taking for the rest of your life. We do not know yet how many people have this outcome or how to predict it. But we do know that the long-term course of bipolar disorder varies considerably from person to person. Throughout the book, I will highlight strategies you can use to decrease your risk of recurrences. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=419))

- A major assumption of this book is that understanding the facts about your disorder will help you and your close family members accept, live with, and cope more effectively with it. Here are some important questions that often ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=479))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- go unanswered because mental health providers simply don’t have time or don’t know the answers: “What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?” “Who am I apart from my disorder?” “Where does ordinary moodiness end and bipolar disorder begin?” “Where did the illness come from?” “How do I know when I’m becoming ill?” “What triggers my mood cycles, and are the triggers different for the highs and lows?” “What can I do to minimize my chances of becoming ill again?” “How do I explain the illness to other people?” “What can I expect from my future?” Effective prevention: Being able to put your illness in an informational context helps you prevent or at least minimize the damage associated with future recurrences and set appropriate goals for your immediate and long-term future.

- By the end of this book, I hope you’ll have gotten useful answers to these questions, together with a more complete understanding of bipolar disorder, a new grasp of who you are and how bipolar disorder fits into your life, and a wealth of illness management techniques. I also hope to leave you knowing where to turn when the ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=489))

- What neither understood was that most people need a low-key, low-demand period of convalescence after a hospitalization so that they can fully recover from an episode of bipolar disorder. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=572))

- Martha has had frustrations in the workplace and finally came to the conclusion that “I’m just not a nine-to-fiver.” She decided to try freelance work, which, although not as financially lucrative as her job, has reduced her stress and given her predictable hours. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=617))

- Martha recognizes that her disorder is recurrent but also feels that she is more in control of her fate. In summing up her developing ability to cope with the disorder, she said, “I’ve learned to accept that I’ve got something biochemical that goes haywire, but it’s not the sum total of who I am. If I could change one thing about myself, it’d be other people’s moods and how they affect me, even when it’s their problem and not mine.” ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=624))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Above all, this book is about hope. If you’ve just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or even if you have had many episodes, you probably have fears about what the future holds. Martha’s story—while perhaps representative of only one form of the disorder and one type of life situation—captures some of the ways that people learn to live with bipolar illness. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder doesn’t have to mean giving up your hopes and aspirations. As you will soon see, you can come to terms with the disorder and develop skills for coping with it and still experience life to its fullest.

- Almost every patient I have worked with describes his or her behavior differently from the way a doctor or family member would. Consider Brent, who has been having trouble holding jobs. He says he is depressed but feels it is due to being unable to deal with his hypercritical boss. As a result, he thinks he needs to switch jobs and find a more permissive work environment. His wife, Alice, thinks he is manic and irritable, not depressed, and that he needs long-term psychotherapy to deal with his problems with ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=686))

- male authority figures. She also thinks he drinks too much and needs to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Brent’s doctor thinks he is in a postmanic depressive episode and would benefit from a combination of medications and couple therapy.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Psychiatrists and psychologists usually think of bipolar disorder as a set of symptoms, which must be present in clusters (that is, more than one at a time) and last for a certain length of time, usually in “episodes” that have a beginning phase, a phase in which symptoms are at their worst, and a recovery phase (see the box). The traditional approach to psychiatric diagnosis described in Chapter 3 follows this line of reasoning. In contrast, people with the illness often prefer to think of bipolar disorder as a series of life experiences, with the actual symptoms being of secondary importance to the factors that provoked them. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=691))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Understanding these varying perspectives will be of considerable use to you, whether you are on your first episode or have had many episodes, in that you will gain some clarity on how your own experiences differ from those of people without bipolar disorder. You may also ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=707))

- Let’s begin by defining the syndrome of bipolar disorder. Its key characteristic is extreme mood swings, from manic highs to severe depressions. It is called a mood disorder because it profoundly influences a person’s experiences of emotion and displays of affect (the way one conveys emotions to others). It is called bipolar because the mood swings occur between two poles, high and low, as opposed to unipolar disorder, where mood swings occur along only one pole—the lows. Some people prefer the broader term bipolar spectrum disorder, which includes bipolar-like conditions that are less severe than traditional bipolar I or II disorder (for example, “unspecified bipolar disorder”) but nonetheless cause suffering and interfere with functioning. In the manic high state, people experience different combinations of the following: elated or euphoric mood (excessive happiness or expansiveness); irritable mood (excessive anger and touchiness); an increase in activity and energy levels; a decreased need for sleep; grandiosity (an inflated sense of themselves and their abilities); increased talkativeness; racing thoughts or jumping from ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=712))

- one idea to another; changes in thinking, perception, and attention (for example, distractibility); and impulsive, reckless behavior. Manic episodes cause significant impairments in a person’s work, social, or family life (for example, causing arrests or leading to traffic accidents). If someone has most of these symptoms but without impaired functioning, we use the term hypomanic. Manic or hypomanic episodes alternate with intervals of depression, in which people become intensely sad, blue, or “down in the dumps,” lose interest in things they ordinarily enjoy, lose weight and appetite, feel fatigued, have difficulty sleeping, feel guilty and bad about themselves, have trouble concentrating or making decisions, and often feel like committing suicide.

- New cases of bipolar disorder have been recognized in young children and in the elderly, but the average age at first onset is around 18 years, with a large proportion of people being diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 19 (Merikangas et al., 2007). Bipolar disorder is generally treated with a range of drugs, ideally given in combination with an evidence-based psychotherapy ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=749))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As noted, the symptoms associated with bipolar mood disorder can be experienced quite differently by the person with the disorder, an observer, and a physician. The disorder affects moods, behavior, and thinking. Your moods, while usually clear to you, cannot always be observed by others. Likewise, you may not always be aware of your behavior or its impact on others, whereas others (family, friends, or doctors) may be acutely aware of it. When people look at the same set of behaviors or experiences through different lenses, you can imagine how much room there is for misinterpretation.

- For example, Beth, age 42, described her mood during manic episodes as “the sudden awareness that I’m not depressed anymore.” Seth, age 27, described his manic states as “tired ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=809))

- Questions a Doctor Might Ask to Distinguish Bipolar Mood Swings from Normal Mood Variability “Do your mood swings cause problems in your social or family life?” “Do your mood swings lead to decreases in your work productivity that last more than a few days?” “Do your mood states last for days at a time with little relief, or do they change when something good happens?” “Do other people notice and comment when your mood shifts?” “Do your mood changes go along with noticeable changes in thinking, sleeping, and energy or activity levels?” “Do your mood swings ever get so out of hand that the police have to be called or a hospitalization becomes necessary?” If your answer to most of these questions is yes, then it is likely that your mood swings go beyond the normal range.

- Grandiose behaviors usually go along with high or euphoric feelings, but not invariably. You may experience an inflated sense of self-confidence and then feel impatient and irritable because others seem slow to go along with your ideas or plans. Grandiose behavior is detrimental not only because of its associated health risks but also because it leads to feelings of shame, which can compound your depression in the aftermath of a manic episode. In the case of the young man just quoted, the police were called in, a scuffle ensued, and a hospitalization followed. Although he later related the incident with a degree of bravado, he admitted to feeling quite embarrassed by his public behavior. In hypomanic episodes, which can occur in either bipolar I or II disorder, a person may have grandiose thoughts that are more muted than in full manic episodes. People in hypomania believe they are more intelligent, better looking, more clever, more creative, and ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=861))

- For every example already given, you can imagine what a counterexample would look like during the depressed phase. In depression, you may become unusually slowed down, like you’re “moving through molasses.” The most mundane of tasks feels like it requires tremendous effort. Your appetite is usually diminished, and taking a shower or brushing your teeth may seem unusually onerous. Typically, the last thing a depressed person wants is sex, and exercise has even less appeal. Socializing seems like an unpleasant chore that requires too much concentration and mental energy. It may also feel threatening, even if those you are meeting are your friends or neighbors. In depression, it can seem nearly impossible to initiate those tasks even if you desperately want to. In other words, depression is quite different from being lazy. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=871))

- Ruminations, in which a person thinks about a certain event again and again, are a frequent accompaniment to depression. Ruminations during the depressive phase are often self-recriminating. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=942))

- No diagnostic label can completely capture your unique situation. In fact, you may feel offended by the diagnostic label because it is incomplete, impersonal, or simply doesn’t do justice to your life experiences. But these labels do serve a purpose. First, using standardized labels allows clinicians to communicate with each other. If I refer a client of mine to another mental health professional and say that “she has bipolar I disorder, with a current depressive episode and mood-incongruent psychotic features,” I can be reasonably sure that this other doctor will know what to expect. This common language serves you well should you switch doctors, as so many of us do today. Second, an accurate diagnosis is important to selecting the right treatment. If you are misdiagnosed as having depression alone, for example, your doctor might recommend a standard antidepressant medication such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), or bupropion (Wellbutrin) without a mood stabilizer like lithium (see ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1047))

- Chapter 6). If you actually have bipolar I disorder, this treatment regimen could cause you to swing into mania or hypomania. Likewise, if you were diagnosed as having bipolar II when the real problem is ADHD, you might not benefit from the SGAs you’ve been given. An accurate diagnostic label helps doctors treat the whole syndrome that is affecting you rather than just the symptoms you are reporting right now.

- The DSM-5 Subtypes of Bipolar Disorder Bipolar I disorder At least one lifetime episode of mania Although not required for the diagnosis, at least one lifetime episode of major depressive disorder Bipolar II disorder At least one lifetime episode of hypomanic disorder At least one lifetime episode of major depressive disorder Unspecified bipolar disorder (formerly not otherwise specified, or NOS) Rapid alteration between manic and depressive symptoms that meet the severity criteria for mania or depression but fall short of the duration criteria (episodes of hypomania lasting fewer than 4 days; depressive episodes lasting less than 2 weeks). This category also covers people with multiple manic episodes (with impairment of functioning) that fall one symptom short of the required number of symptoms. Episode designations The full diagnosis requires a “polarity” designation of your current episode (manic, hypomanic, depressed) plus two “specifiers.” The first is whether mixed features are present (that is, at least three symptoms from the opposite polarity, such as racing thoughts that accompany a depressive episode). The second specifier is an anxiety/distress feature: whether you have severe subjective apprehension, nervousness, or anxiety in conjunction with your depression or mania. People with comorbid anxiety sometimes do not respond to mood stabilizers alone and may require other medications or therapies to stabilize fully.

- People with hypomania experience the first of the three stages of mania described in Chapter 2, but they do not go beyond this: they have sleep problems, irritability, increased activity, and an inflated sense of themselves, but not to the dangerous or psychotic levels of the fully manic person. Generally, hypomanic episodes do not cause big problems in your work, family, or social life, but you may still experience some interpersonal difficulties when in this state (for example, more arguments with your spouse or kids or more confrontations with coworkers). Hypomanias do not require hospitalization. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1140))

- DSM-5 has a “hedge” category called unspecified bipolar disorder. This category usually is reserved for people who have had several manic episodes that do not meet the full duration criteria. Some definitions require you to ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1166))

- have had a major depressive episode as well. For example, Shelley, 31, had had three hypomanic episodes with irritability, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and pressure of speech that each lasted 1–2 days; her single depressive episode came after the birth of her first child. Estevan, age 46, had lengthy, unremitting periods of depression that his doctor originally labeled as dysthymic disorder. His diagnosis was changed to unspecified bipolar disorder when he had two brief (2-day) manic episodes marked by irritable mood, grandiosity, and decreased need for sleep, along with a sudden deterioration in his functioning. Both episodes remitted quickly but, sadly, were followed by a return of his depressive state. Unspecified bipolar disorder is most frequently used to describe children or adolescents whose cycling pattern looks much like an adult bipolar I cycle, but whose episodes are frequent and very short (for example, lasting only a day). Although this symptom pattern may sound like it could characterize almost any child, it is actually fairly rare: the child has to meet full mania or hypomania criteria and show clear changes in functioning for this single day. Children also have to have had multiple episodes like this, not just one. About 58% of kids who have the unspecified bipolar diagnosis and are genetically susceptible to bipolar disorder (that is, they have a first- or second-degree relative with bipolar disorder) “convert” to bipolar I or II disorder in 4–5 years. They also experience substantial impairments in their school and social ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1168))

- Diagnostic confusion can also occur because of the diagnostic criteria themselves. Certain symptoms are characteristic of more than one disorder. Psychotic experiences (for example, grandiose delusions) can occur in disorders other than bipolar disorder, such as schizophrenia. Problems with distractibility occur in mania and in ADHD. Sleep disturbance and irritability can occur in depression, anxiety disorders, or psychotic disorders.

The common use of DSM-5 and improved training in the recognition of mood disorders make diagnoses more reliable than they used to be. Nonetheless, errors inevitably occur. Your physician may need to observe you during an episode and once you have recovered to be sure of your diagnosis. If you have strong doubts about the diagnosis you have been given, getting a second opinion is a good idea. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1374))

- ADHD is not accompanied by the extreme high and low mood states that are the hallmark of bipolar disorder. It is not typical for people with ADHD to experience elated highs, goal-directed behavior, hypersexuality, decreased need for sleep, or grandiosity (Geller et al., 1998), or to experience deep depressions with suicidality, feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, and loss of interests alternating with periods of mood stability.

- People with borderline personality disorder do become depressed and often meet full criteria for a major depressive episode at some point in their lives. This is one of the reasons that telling it apart from bipolar II disorder is so difficult—the person may have had times of being excessively angry, restless, anxious, and depressed, which can look like a mixed episode. But people with true borderline personality disorder do not become manic and very rarely become hypomanic, with a 4-day or greater period of activation. If you think some of the preceding features fit you, it is possible you have bipolar disorder comorbid with borderline personality disorder. Why is it important to know if you have borderline personality as well as (or instead of) bipolar disorder? Currently, there are no agreed-on drug-treatment guidelines for people with borderline personality or those with ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1470))

- both borderline and bipolar disorders. People with both disorders tend to have more trouble finding the right combination of medications than people with bipolar disorder only. This is in part because their doctors may not have done a careful diagnostic assessment. On the other hand, if you have been misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder when your real diagnosis is bipolar II disorder, you might do better with medications like lamotrigine (Lamictal) or quetiapine (Seroquel) than with medications you may have been given—typically, antidepressants like fluoxetine (Prozac) (John & Sharma, 2009). If you think you might have borderline personality disorder, it is especially important to consider certain structured forms of psychotherapy in addition to medications. Various treatments have research support for borderline personality disorder, most notably dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which combines cognitive and behavioral strategies with Zen Buddhist mindfulness practices (Linehan & Wilks, 2015); and mentalization-based therapy, which explores our tendency to misread our own or others’ emotions (Bateman & Fonagy, 2010).

- I hope you can see now how important it is to obtain a proper diagnosis and to rule out competitive diagnoses. Knowing the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder and understanding how these symptoms manifest themselves, both in you and in others, is empowering. As you’ll see later, awareness of the symptoms that you typically experience during mood episodes will go a long way in helping you prevent these episodes from spiraling out of control. In the next chapter, I’ll discuss the problems people have in adjusting to or coping with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Some deny the reality of the disorder and believe that their symptoms are just exaggerations of their personality. Some overcommit to the diagnosis and unnecessarily try to limit their career and personal aspirations, and others reluctantly agree to the diagnosis but continue living their lives as if they were illness free. No one likes to believe that he or she has a psychiatric disorder that requires long-term treatment. Coming to accept the diagnosis is a difficult emotional process.

- Why is the process of acceptance so painful? Coming to terms with having the disorder may mean admitting to a new role for yourself in your family, in the workforce, or in your personal relationships. It may require you to make decisions about restructuring your life and priorities, which may mean viewing yourself differently. For example, Luiz, age 25, gave up his apartment and returned to live with his parents after his hospitalization. He then had to deal with their hypervigilance and increased attempts to control his behavior, which made him feel like he was a child again. Rob, age 38, had been quite successful in his work as a civil engineer. After his bipolar I diagnosis was revealed, he found that people at work seemed afraid of him. He attributed losing his job to the disclosure of his illness. Nancy, age 44, noted that after she learned of her bipolar II diagnosis and told many of her friends about it, at least one “dumped me because I was too ‘high maintenance.’ ” You can imagine the pain and confusion you might feel when there are such costs to acknowledging the disorder.

- As I mentioned in Chapter 2, bipolar disorder can be difficult to distinguish from the normal ups and downs of human life. You may have always been moody or temperamental and believe that your high or low periods are just exaggerations of your natural moodiness. How do you know what is really your illness and what is your “self” or personality (your habits, attitudes, and styles of relating to others—the way you are most of the time)? How do you train yourself to know the difference between you when you’re well and you when you’re ill and not fool yourself into thinking that changes in mood, energy, or activity are just “how I’ve always been”?

After all, they have to revise their image of themselves, which is painful and difficult to do. Others, especially those who were diagnosed some time ago, come to believe they have the disorder but continue to lead their lives as if they did not. You can imagine why people would react this way; in fact, you may even recognize these reactions in yourself. Nevertheless, these styles of coping can cause trouble for you, especially if you refuse to take medications that would help you, or regularly engage in high-risk activities (for example, staying up all night, getting drunk or high frequently) that can worsen your illness.

- One of the more creative thinkers in our field, Hagop Akiskal, has an interesting slant on the whole question. He believes that, for many people with bipolar disorder, the behaviors, habits, and attitudes that sound like ongoing personality attributes are really mild or “subthreshold” forms of mood disorder, or bipolar disorder in its early stages of development. He describes four temperamental disturbances that he believes predispose people to bipolar disorder (see the box) and presents evidence that people with these temperaments, even if they have never had a major depressive, hypomanic, mixed, or manic episode, often have a family history of bipolar disorder and are vulnerable to developing the illness (Akiskal et al., 2006). Why is it important for you to examine whether one of these temperaments applies to you? Because if you have one of them, you’re at risk for a worsening of your disorder if you are not getting proper treatment. For example, if you had dysthymia or cyclothymia in adolescence, you are at risk for developing bipolar depressive episodes earlier rather than later (Hillegers et al., 2005; Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Klein, 2003; Van Meter et al., 2017). Lithium can be used to treat cyclothymia as well as bipolar disorder.

- child or adolescent, you are at risk for developing hypomanic episodes, especially if you take an antidepressant medication and are not simultaneously taking a mood stabilizer such as lithium (Van Meter & Youngstrom, 2012). If you have any of the four temperaments, you may still experience mood variability even once you return to your baseline after a manic or depressive episode. The notion is that these temperaments are relatively constant and reflect a biologically based vulnerability to your disorder. They come before the onset of the disorder and remain present even after the worst of the symptoms have ceased.

- The flip side of this “personality versus disorder” question is whether one or more episodes of mania or depression can actually change your personality or character. This is a very complicated question. Many people, particularly those who have had many mood episodes, feel that the disorder and the experiences of hospitalization, medications, psychotherapy, and painful life events have fundamentally changed who they are. People who have just been diagnosed may not worry so much that their personality will be changed by the diagnosis. They may worry instead that people will relate to them differently because of it—and then start acting differently as a result.

It explains why I haven’t been able to hold a job and why relationships haven’t worked out.

- episode. You may start to think that you can accomplish little in your life, believing “All I am is bipolar, and I can’t change. It’s all a brain disease, and I can’t expect much from myself.” This way of thinking may make you avoid going back to work, withdraw from social relationships, and rely more and more on the caregiving of your family members. In case it isn’t obvious, I disagree with this way of characterizing bipolar disorder. Many—in fact, most—of my patients are productive people who have successful interpersonal relationships. They have adjusted to the necessity of taking medications, but they don’t feel controlled by their illness or its treatments. They have developed strategies for managing their stress levels but don’t completely avoid challenging situations either. I have been amazed by how many of my most severely ill clients call me years later to tell me they’ve gotten married, had kids, and/or started an exciting new job or even a company. But without knowing the future, some people overarm themselves and go too far in trying to protect themselves from the world. You may find that you’re more likely to underidentify with the disorder when in the manic pole of the illness, whereas you may overidentify with it when experiencing the depressive pole. This is, in part, because depression dampens your motivation to initiate certain activities, like work, socializing, or sexual intimacy. You may have subtle problems with memory or concentration as well, rendering the world a confusing, blurry ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=1934))

- place that demands too much. The illness can seem like an incredible burden that erases any hopes for the future. When you feel this way, you may, understandably, begin to merge the illness with your sense of who you are and who you will become. If you have symptoms of depression, it’s important not to take on more than you can handle and to stick to your guns about what you do and don’t feel able to do (even when others want you to do more). But remember also that your depression is likely to go away, with the proper combination of medications, psychotherapy, family and friendship support, physical exercise, and time. So, it’s a good idea to set some limited goals for what you can accomplish even while you’re depressed, to help you become more energized. Maintaining a certain level of behavioral activation can protect you against a worsening mood state (see Chapter 10).

- Keep in mind several “mantras” about the diagnosis. 1. Bipolar disorder is not a life sentence. As I’ve discussed, underidentifying and overidentifying are based on painful experiences from the past and understandable fears and uncertainties about the future. But having bipolar illness doesn’t mean you have to give up your identity, hopes, and aspirations. Try to think of bipolar disorder in the same way you might think of another chronic medical illness that requires you to take medication regularly (for example, high blood pressure or asthma). Taking medication over the long term markedly reduces the chances that your illness will interfere with your life. There are also certain lifestyle adaptations you will need to make (such as visiting regularly with a psychiatrist or therapist, arranging blood tests, keeping your sleep–wake cycles regulated, moderating your exposure to stress, choosing work that helps you maintain a stable routine). None of these changes, however, requires that you give up your life goals, including having a successful career, maintaining good friendships and family relationships, being physically healthy, having romance, or getting married and having children.

- 2. Many creative, productive people have lived with this illness. Bipolar disorder is one of a very small set of illnesses that may have an upside to it: people who have it are often highly productive and creative. This is because, in part, when you’re not actively cycling in and out of episodes of the disorder, your innate mental capabilities, imagination, artistic talents, and personality strengths come to the fore. In her book Touched with Fire, Kay Jamison (1993) discusses the link between bipolar disorder and artistic creativity. In reading her work, you will discover that you are not alone in your struggles. Some of the most influential people in art, literature, business, and politics have had the disorder and have produced work that has had lasting effects on our society. A recently documented example is the poet Robert Lowell, whose life and struggle with bipolar disorder are described in Jamison’s (2017) book Setting the River on Fire. 3. Try to maintain a healthy sense of who you are and think about how your personality strengths can be drawn on in dealing with the illness. As you reflect on who you were before you were diagnosed, and once you have completed the trait checklist, you will probably recall many of your personality strengths. Perhaps you are assertive, sociable, or intellectual. How can you be appropriately assertive in getting proper medical treatment? Can you use your natural sociability to call on your friends, family, and neighbors to help you through rough times? Can you use your natural intellectual inclinations to read up on and learn as much as you can about your illness?

- Doing so may generate a feeling of continuity between who you used to be and who you are now. 4. The way you feel right now is not necessarily the way you will feel in 3 months, 6 months, or a year. You may be feeling bad about your diagnosis and unable to function at the level that you know you’re capable of. This rough period may make you feel like you have to give up control to your family, your doctors, and, worst of all, your illness—a prospect that feels highly distasteful. But in all likelihood, with proper treatment, you will return to a state that is close to where you used to be or that at least is more manageable. In the same way that someone who has had a bad viral flu has to stay in bed for another few days after the worst symptoms have cleared, you may need a period of convalescence before you can get back to your ordinary routines and functioning. 5. There are things you can do in addition to taking medications to control the cycling of your mood states.

Essentially, the strength of the signals transmitted through the spaces between the nerve cells in your brain (synapses) is different from that of people without bipolar disorder.

Recognizing that you may be biologically and genetically vulnerable to mood swings and that certain factors are particularly stressful for you is empowering: these are the first steps in learning to manage your disorder. By the chapter’s end you should have a general idea of how genetics and biology answer the question “How did I get this?” and how these factors combine with stress to bring about new episodes of bipolar disorder. Later chapters provide practical suggestions for minimizing the impact of stressful events or interpersonal circumstances.

- This means that bipolar disorder has a strong genetic component, but if the illness were entirely genetic, the identical twin rate would be 100%. We know there must be nongenetic environmental causes as well, and these are discussed later in this chapter. Genes are powerful determinants of the likelihood that a person will develop bipolar disorder; in fact, bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable of psychiatric conditions. Knowing these facts may or may not make you feel better about your condition. Some people feel absolved of self-blame upon learning the disorder is inherited, especially if they previously believed or were told that their symptoms of depression or mania were expressions of a character weakness. Other people feel “defective” or fearful that they will pass on bad genes to their children. I will talk about these issues more below, but first let’s consider what it is that is actually passed on from generation to generation.

- If you have children, you may know whether one or more of them has a psychiatric disorder and can fill in those circles or squares. Of course, your children may not yet have reached an age when a disorder is recognizable—bipolar disorder can be diagnosed at any age, but the majority of people develop it in their middle to late teens (see Chapter 14). Be sure to fill in any psychiatric information relevant to your children’s other parent and draw in “tree branches” to any affected or unaffected relatives in his or her family of origin. As you know, it is possible that your children inherited mood disorders from the other side of the family or from both sides.

- Now, what do you do with the information if you have concluded that bipolar disorder, or at least depression, runs in your family? Genetic evidence has practical implications for your life. First, the fact that the disorder runs in your family should make you feel less ashamed of having the illness. None of us can control the genes with which we come into this world. We also don’t know how to engineer the environment to prevent the original onset of the disorder. As you’ll see in later chapters, there are things you can do to control the cycling of your illness. But getting the disorder in the first place is heavily influenced by your genetic makeup. In other words, it isn’t your fault—a fact that your family members may also need to hear (see Chapter 13). As the father of one young man with bipolar disorder told me, “For a long time we thought he was just a screw-up. He seemed able to screw up everything. But eventually we realized there was an illness and that there was something really wrong with his brain. He had a real problem that had a chemical basis, and it was probably something he got from me or from my side of the family.

- A family history of bipolar disorder is not a conclusive piece of evidence; it provides only one piece of the diagnostic puzzle.

It’s the same way with cardiovascular (heart disease) risk: it certainly runs in families, but not everyone in a genetically susceptible family ends up with high blood pressure, and certainly not everyone with a family history of heart disease ends up dying of a heart attack. What people eat, whether they smoke, their weight, how much they exercise, their levels of stress, and a whole host of other factors come into play.

- As indicated above, if you have bipolar disorder, your chances of passing it on to your kids average about 9%, with an additional 14% chance that they will develop major depression. These probabilities are comparable to those for other psychiatric disorders—the rate of schizophrenia in the children of mothers with schizophrenia is about 13%. So, the odds are in your favor: in most cases, your children won’t develop anything. See Chapter 14 for more information on children. Of course, the question of whether to have children goes well beyond statistics. Whether you are a woman or a man, your answer to this question should be based on considerations such as whether you want children, are clinically stable enough to take care of a child, whether you are physically healthy in other ways, and, where applicable, whether you are satisfied with your relationship with your partner or with your ability to take care of a child on your own.

- For a long time, scientists talked about bipolar disorder in terms of the amount of certain neurotransmitters: people with the disorder had too little serotonin, too little norepinephrine, or too much dopamine. A major figure in our field, Husseini Manji, encourages us to think instead about the disorder as an “impairment of synaptic and cellular plasticity” (Manji, 2009, p. 2). This means that people with bipolar disorder have genetically influenced problems with information processing in synapses (the spaces between nerve cells) and circuits (the neuronal connections between one brain structure and others), rather than too much or too little of a certain chemical. To get technical for a moment, we suspect that people with bipolar disorder have disturbances in intracellular signaling cascades, which regulate the neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormonal systems that are central to the limbic system. The limbic system, which includes the amygdala and the hippocampus, regulates emotional states, sleep, and arousal, all of which are strongly affected in bipolar disorder. Additionally, when people with bipolar disorder and major depression are under stress, their adrenal glands may overproduce certain hormones (for example, glucocorticoids). Long-term stress and glucocorticoid overproduction may damage or destroy cells in the hippocampus, a brain structure that ([Location 2362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=2362))

New research involving persons with bipolar disorder has also found problems in their second messenger systems (also known as signal transducers), which are molecules inside brain nerve cells. When one nerve cell fires, it sends neurotransmitters (the “first messengers”) to the next nerve cell. Then a second messenger system informs the second nerve cell that the first nerve cell has fired. In other words, second messengers help to determine whether a cell communicates messages to other parts of the same cell and to nearby cells. For example, lithium and valproate slow down activity of the protein kinase C signaling cascade, an important mediator of signals within the cells when their receptors are stimulated by neurotransmitters (Harrison, Geddes, & Tunbridge, 2018; Newberg, Catapano, Zarate, & Manji, 2008). This exciting research suggests that changes in second messenger systems may constitute one form of biological vulnerability to bipolar disorder—one that may be partially correctable by medications.

- Can bipolar disorder be caused by environmental factors, such as a high-conflict marriage, problems with parents, life changes, a difficult job, or a history of abuse as a child? These are extremely important questions. Indeed, people with bipolar disorder are 2.6 times as likely to have been in an abusive environment as children than healthy people, with emotional abuse being the most common form (being severely criticized or humiliated or threatened with a loss of basic securities) (Palmier-Claus, Berry, Bucci, Mansell, & Varese, 2016). Most scientists in the field doubt that a traumatic event or an emotionally abusive family alone can cause bipolar disorder without the contributing influences of genetics and biology. However, we are reasonably certain that stress and trauma increase the chances that you will have a recurrence of mania or depression. It may also affect the timing of your first episodes (for example, whether the illness starts in childhood). Your level and type of stress may also affect how long it takes you to recover from an episode or your risk of having another episode within a certain time frame. Clinicians are interested in knowing about the role of stress in your life because it can help them in treatment planning, such as deciding what type of therapy to recommend to you.

It wasn’t of much interest to anyone but me, but I was surprised to find that each ‘up and down’ went along with something involving my family. I always knew this to be true on some level, but it was so obvious once I kept track of it. “Sometimes my mood would drop because of something stupid, like an annoying phone call from my mother about forgetting someone’s birthday. Other times it was more serious, like when my brother’s wife said she didn’t want me to babysit my nieces anymore because she didn’t trust me not to be crazy. A criticism that felt like a shock to the system. And then if something good happened—like my stepmom complimenting my cooking or my dad telling me he liked my writing—I could feel my mood escalating. Every time I had some interaction with my family, anything involving emotion, I would get stressed out and my mood would change.” —A 32-year-old woman with bipolar II disorder ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=2560))

- The discovery of lithium treatment is usually attributed to John Cade (1949) (see the box below). Lithium is considered a first-line agent in treating manic episodes, often in combination with an SGA. The supporting evidence for lithium in preventing recurrences (maintenance treatment) is more conclusive than for any other medication (Leucht et al., 2013).

- Lithium has been known to have mood-calming properties since at least 200 A.D., when a Greek doctor named Galen used it in baths for people with mental illness. Various lithium bromide compounds were marketed to the public in the 1800s but were found to be highly toxic. If you bought a 7UP soft drink prior to 1948, it would have had lithium in it. John Cade, an Australian physician, happened upon lithium by accident (Cade, 1949). His experiment involved injecting uric acid mixed with lithium into the bloodstream of guinea pigs. Injection with lithium calmed the animals down and made them less active. Dr. Cade then thought to try lithium with a human guinea pig, one of his most severely ill manic patients, a 51-year-old man. The patient responded very well and for the first time was able to function outside of a hospital. This story of scientific serendipity is tempered by the fact that this patient took himself off the medication 6 months later, against medical advice, perhaps foreshadowing the wide-ranging problem of nonadherence among people taking lithium. Nonetheless, lithium came into general use in the 1960s and has been used regularly in the United States since 1970, to the great benefit of many people.

- Some people take their lithium in divided doses, several times a day, and some only once. This is one of the decisions you and your doctor can make when trying to figure out how best to control your side effects. For example, there is an extended-release form of lithium that can be substituted if you have severe nausea. A correct dosage is one that brings your blood level into a therapeutic range. The therapeutic range your doctor targets for you ([Location 2775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=2775))

Children with bipolar disorder often need higher doses of lithium than adults to get a therapeutic blood level, whereas persons over the age of 65, who may be more sensitive to the side effects of lithium, are given lower dosages.

- When you take any medication, it’s important to know the possible side effects so that changes in your body will not come as a surprise to you and you’ll know to discuss them with your doctor. All mood-stabilizing agents have some side effects. Be skeptical of “natural” or “homeopathic” mood remedies that presumably have no adverse effects. No substance is both free of side effects and effective as a mood stabilizer or antidepressant. For example, Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) can cause high blood pressure and headaches; omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) can cause stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea.

- Your doctor should include any side effects you report as an important source of information in planning your treatment. Side effects can often be controlled in some of the ways described in the box below. In Chapter 7 you’ll find a side-effect recording sheet that will help you communicate with your doctor about complications associated with your medications. Individuals have some predictable side effects with lithium, but their severity will vary a great deal from person to person. Common side effects of lithium include thirst, nausea, water retention, frequent urination, hand tremors, fatigue, diarrhea, or a metallic taste in the mouth. More troublesome side effects include weight gain, mental sluggishness or problems with memory, development or flare-up of skin conditions (such as acne or psoriasis); or stomach discomfort, nausea, or diarrhea. Some people also develop hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormone. Kidney functioning (the ability of the kidney to concentrate urine) can also be affected if lithium is taken over a long period of time. Make sure your doctor is monitoring your creatinine levels, a measure of kidney functioning. ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=2818))

- People who take lithium must have their blood drawn regularly to make sure they are getting the proper dosage. If you are starting lithium for the first time and are being stabilized from a manic or depressive episode, you will probably have to get your blood tested every 2–3 weeks for the first 1–2 months of treatment and then every month for the next 3 months. If all has gone well up to that point, your doctor will probably recommend you get it tested every 3 months or so. The purpose is to make sure you have a therapeutic level of lithium in your bloodstream. Generally, your physician will check your blood level 10–14 hours after your last lithium dosage.

- PERSONALIZED CARE TIP: Will lithium affect your mental sharpness or creativity? A less well-known side effect of lithium is “cognitive dulling,” where people feel like they have lost their usual mental sharpness or edge or that emotions are blunted. This is especially a problem for those in the arts. If you are a person who writes music or poetry, paints, or has other artistic abilities, you may feel that your creativity is diminished when taking lithium. You may yearn for your hypomanic days, when ideas, images, or solutions to problems seemed to flow more readily. The best solution to the problem of cognitive dulling is to talk to your doctor about getting a lower dose of lithium or a different dosing plan. If you are in the maintenance phase, your dosage should already be lower than it was during acute treatment, but your doctor may recommend that you adjust downward even further until you find the “sweet spot” that allows you full artistic expression while still protecting you against significant mood swings. Alternatively, you may decide to try another ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=2859))

But it does herald the development of more severe depressive episodes. It can also be the first in a series of rapidly cycling mood states or, for people with bipolar I disorder, the first stage of a full-blown manic episode. So treating hypomania can be an important preventive maneuver. The medication options usually involve increasing your mood stabilizer dosage or adding a low-dose SGA to your regimen. If you have bipolar II disorder and have never been fully manic, you may decide instead that “watchful waiting” is the best option.

- Having your blood tested regularly also helps prevent lithium toxicity, in which your body accumulates lithium at very high levels. The signs of toxicity include problems with balance and coordination, severe diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, blurry vision, slurring of speech, extreme shakiness of the hands, severe nausea or vomiting, and mental confusion or disorientation. These signs are most likely to occur when you have changed your diet, become dehydrated due to an illness or excessive exercise, or are taking diuretic drugs (for example, for blood pressure) or anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (for pain or fever). Because this toxic state is extremely dangerous and even potentially deadly, it is important to know the signs (and acquaint your close relatives with them as well) so that you can get in to see your doctor as soon as possible, have your blood level checked, and, in most cases, have your lithium adjusted or stopped.

Thyroid supplements are usually marketed under the name levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Levothroid) or liothyronine (Cytomel or T3). People with bipolar disorder often have comorbid hypothyroidism, a condition of hormonal insufficiency in which people feel inertia, low mood, slowness, and sleep disturbances.

- Changes in exposure to light during the different seasons—and in different geographic locations—have long been known to affect people’s mood states. You may have noticed that your moods vary considerably with the season of the year. Many people have seasonal mood disorders, which usually means they have depression in the fall or winter months and, less commonly, mania or hypomania in the spring or summer. As a result there has been quite a lot of enthusiasm for bright light treatment. It is now commonplace to find homes and office buildings that are outfitted with “mood lighting.” There are relatively few controlled trials of light therapy for bipolar disorder. One recent, small-scale randomized trial indicated that individuals with bipolar depression who were ([Location 3356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=3356))

Importantly, the bright white light was administered for about 45 minutes in the middle of the day rather than in the morning. Light treatment can interfere with your sleep if you are not protected by a mood stabilizer or SGA. Nonetheless, you should discuss this alternative with your physician if you have winter depression with excessive sleepiness, overeating, and lethargy or feel that your mood is very reactive to changes in daylight hours.

- The nature of bipolar disorder is such that even when you feel better, you still have an underlying biological predisposition to the illness.

- Concordance with medication refers to the degree of consistency between the plans recommended by the physician and the plans carried out by the patient (Reilly-Harrington & Sachs, 2006). Nonconcordance means that you have not followed the physician’s recommendations in taking your medications or have stopped taking them altogether, against your doctor’s advice. But people can become nonconcordant in any number of ways. For example, some people take their medications correctly for several weeks and then stop all of them abruptly. Some stop only one medication in a “cocktail” of medications: they are on lithium, valproate, and quetiapine and decide to discontinue everything but the valproate (or take a higher dosage of this medication than prescribed). Other people drop their dosages or take medications intermittently (for example, take only half of their recommended ([Location 3586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=3586))

- Why the term concordance? Many alternative terms have been proposed in the medical literature, the most common of which are adherence and compliance. In my experience, persons with bipolar disorder don’t usually like either of those terms. Nonadherence feels critical and judgmental and can be associated in the mind with tape or glue (one patient asked, “What am I? A Post-it note?”). It implies that the person with the disorder is unwilling or unable to stick to an agreed-on program. Even worse is the term noncompliance, which implies a paternalistic stance: the patient with bipolar disorder is not going along with what others insist that he or she must do. I prefer the term concordance because it underlines the importance of an alliance between you and your physician. Stopping medications or taking them inconsistently can often be traced to physicians, who may have failed to (1) articulate the purposes of the various medications in your regimen, (2) alert you to possible side effects or their intensity, or (3) communicate appreciation, caring, and respect for you as a person. The term nonconcordance suggests differences in how patients and their physicians think about treatment. ([Location 3594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=3594))

But you may have strong feelings about medications even if you have been taking mood stabilizers for a long time. In this section, I discuss some of the reasons people stop taking their medications and some counterarguments to consider if you find yourself agreeing with these reasons.

- There is no mincing words about it: mood stabilizers do take away the high periods. When people take lithium or any of the other mood stabilizers or SGAs, their moods become more stable. Some people complain that they become too stable. Stability puts you in the driver’s seat and gives you actual control over your fate rather than the illusion of control that mania gives you. But stability also means giving up the intensity of the roller-coaster ride that bipolar disorder provides. In other words, taking medicines can mean increased stability at the cost of the exciting, positive features of the disorder.

- artists, writers, poets, and musicians probably had bipolar disorder or a variant of it. Examples include Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Robert Lowell, Ernest Hemingway, Delmore Schwartz, Vincent van Gogh, and Ludwig van Beethoven. Kay Jamison (1993) has written extensively about this issue in her book Touched with Fire: Manic–Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. I can also recommend a recent review of creativity studies in bipolar disorder by Sheri Johnson and her colleagues (Johnson et al., 2012). The link with creativity can put the person with bipolar disorder in a bind. What if you pride yourself on your writing, artistic talent, or musical ability and fear that taking medicines will destroy your creative output? If having mood swings can improve the quality of your art by investing it with emotion and passion, why take them away? Does mood-stabilizing medication actually interfere with creativity? Not many research studies have been done, and most are case studies that have examined a select group of artistic people to observe what effect lithium had on their work. None of these studies on creativity involve people on anticonvulsants or antipsychotics, so we don’t know if those medications are better or worse.

- What do these findings mean for people who have artistic talent? First, lithium can have effects on your cognitive or motor performance, but it isn’t at all certain that it interferes with your creativity. In fact, the opposite may be true. Among eminent writers, the bipolar II form of the disorder (depression with hypomania) is more common than full bipolar I disorder (Carreno & Goodnick, 1998). In another study, people with bipolar II were more likely to draw or play musical instruments and to have greater focus and clarity during their highs than people with bipolar I disorder (McCraw, Parker, Fletcher, & Friend, 2013). In other words, milder manic or hypomanic states (for example, positive emotions combined with high energy but little impairment) may be more clearly linked to creativity than full manic states (Johnson et al., 2012).

- Many side effects can be managed with a simple dosage adjustment (for example, dropping the number of lithium tablets so that you feel less sluggish mentally) or by taking your pills at different times. For example, if you take lithium in one dose rather than several, you may have less need to urinate frequently.

- “My Problems Are Psychological, Not Biological” If you feel that your mood problems have only a psychological origin (for example, related to childhood trauma or disturbed family relationships or the absence of a romantic relationship), then it may not be obvious to you what role medication has in your treatment. You may feel that your underlying vulnerabilities have more to do with a negative view of yourself than with biological or genetic factors.

- This is one of the reasons we recommend medications and psychotherapy in combination, rather than as substitutes for each other. Remember, your problems needn’t be biological or psychological. They can be both. Medications may actually make your psychotherapy more successful. Most psychotherapists say that they can’t accomplish much when a person with bipolar disorder is in a severely depressed, manic, or mixed state. If medicines make your mood stable, or at least stable enough for you to make it to regular therapy appointments and carry through on homework assignments, you’ll benefit a great deal more from psychotherapy. You’ll be able to deal more productively with the underlying issues that may be contributing to your unhappiness or distress.

- As this woman says, and as Kate Millet says in the quote at the beginning of this chapter, taking medications can mean feeling like you’re giving in to your family’s demands. If you are a young adult and live with your parents, you can quickly get tired of hearing them nag you to take your pills, interpret your emotional responses to everyday things as signs that you need more medicine, or remind you that you’re the sick one in the family. You may believe that others in the family also have the disorder and that they should be the ones taking medicines, not you. Most young adults want independence from their parents, and having a psychiatric disorder can make it seem like the clock has been set back by a few years. Likewise, swallowing pills, seeing doctors, and getting your blood levels tested may feel like you are under your parents’ thumb. The reality is that taking medications, while perhaps initially reflecting your acquiescence to your parents’ plans, greatly increases your chances of independence from them later. If your mood is stable, there is a much greater chance that you’ll be able to function away from home. But it’s hard to take this long-term ([Location 3905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=3905))

Your spouse may be taking a hard line with you; some of my clients’ spouses have even threatened to leave if their partner didn’t remain consistent in taking medications. Your spouse’s insistence that you take your pills can make the option feel all the more unappealing to you. How do people resolve this dilemma? Many of my patients eventually come around to recognizing the role of mood stabilizers in maintaining their own health and their relationships with their family members. But it is important that you feel the decision to take medicines is largely your own. Chapter 13 gives you some tips on how to communicate with family members on illness-related problems, including how to negotiate the sometimes volatile issue of taking medications.

- When you’re recording stressors, recall one issue raised in Chapter 5: it can be difficult to tell whether stress was the cause or the effect of your mood. Over time, mood charting may help you determine the timing of events in relation to changes in your mood. For example, did you race to the airport and then feel a surge in your energy level and mood, or were you feeling speedy before you raced to the airport? Did you get into an argument with your father and then feel down about yourself, or were you feeling down on yourself and irritable before you got into the argument? Don’t worry for now if you’re not sure which caused which. Instead, just try to identify the factors that coincide: stressful events, mood states, and sleep patterns.

- You may be a person who seeks out others naturally, or you may prefer spending time by yourself. Either way, when you’re depressed, it is hard to interact with anybody. Unless you have a social support system in place when you’re well, you may find it hard to reach out for the very help you need when depression strikes. Likewise, maintaining regular contact with your social support group when you’re well will do much to prevent future depression. When you encounter the inevitable conflicts that come up with family members or coworkers, your friends and supportive relatives can be like a landing pad of comfort and steadiness. They provide a counterpart to, and minimize the impact of, other stressful conflicts. Sheri Johnson and colleagues (Johnson, Winett, Meyer, Greenhouse, & Miller, 1999) found that after an episode of depression, people with bipolar disorder who had good social support systems recovered more quickly and had less severe depression symptoms over 6 months than those with small or nonexistent support systems.

- If you have not had full manic or mixed episodes, but only hypomanic ones (that is, you have bipolar II or unspecified bipolar disorder), little damage may have been done during your activated states. Nonetheless, you may have found that hypomanic episodes—much like their more severe counterparts—bring on major depressions in their aftermath. The adage that “what goes up must come down” applies only too well to bipolar disorder. Because of their biological bases, you can’t prevent manic or hypomanic episodes from occurring altogether. But you may be able to control how severe they get and limit the damage they cause. You can learn to “head them off at the pass” by recognizing when they are starting to occur and then putting into motion plans for preventing yourself from spiraling upward even further. In Robert’s case, there was a brief window of opportunity in which his early warning signs were apparent and more could be done to prevent his escalation into a full-blown episode. You’ll learn more about how Robert and Jessie learned to anticipate and derail his worst manic symptoms later in this chapter. If you can successfully implement a plan to prevent or decrease the severity of your manic episodes, then your ([Location 4728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=4728))

- family, job, and social functioning will almost certainly improve. Some aspects of this plan will involve things you do on your own, and other aspects will involve the actions of your family members or significant other. Still other aspects will involve your doctor and therapist (if you have one). When mania is escalating, you will need the help of others because it will be hard to rein yourself in. It’s best to make relapse prevention plans when you’re well, because when you are becoming high, you will have a difficult time recognizing the potential dangers associated with your behavior and what to do to curtail the upward cycle. I think of a developing manic episode as a train leaving a station. When the train is starting to move and someone wants to get off, the conductor still has time to stop the train before it reaches full speed. But if he waits too long, the train will be on its own trajectory and passengers will be stuck on the train until it stops or crashes on its own. Manic episodes can feel like this train. The key is to be able to tell when the train has started to move and to try to get off it before it’s barreling down the tracks.

- In this chapter, you’ll learn a three-step strategy for getting off the train before mania runs its full course. The method, called a relapse prevention drill, was used successfully in our studies of family-focused treatment for people with bipolar disorder (see Chapter 6). A relapse drill is like the fire drills you took part in back in school. Like fire drills, relapse drills are formulated when everything is safe and going well so that you know exactly what to do should an emergency occur. The relapse drill involves a series of steps you take to try to prevent the damage that could be done by full recurrence of mania: Identify your prodromal symptoms. List preventive measures. Create a written plan or contract detailing the prevention procedures. ([Location 4753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=4753))

- doctor, and members of your core circle (see also the examples in the sections that follow). In the third phase you, your significant others, and your doctors put the first and second steps together and develop a written plan, which is a kind of contract, for what to do when you feel a manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode coming on. It’s important that all key players have ready access to the contract so that they can help you put it into action when you are beginning to escalate, since that is when you’re least likely to seek help. This chapter focuses only on the prevention of manic or mixed episodes. This material is also relevant to preventing hypomanic episodes, which, while doing less damage, often have a similar set of warning signs and can be arrested with some of the same preventive strategies. The two chapters that follow this one discuss ways to prevent or minimize the downward spiral of depression. But before I get into the actual mechanics of developing a contract, let me say something about a sensitive issue that may have already occurred to you: the discomfort of relying on others when you are becoming ill.

- What is this distress about? Most people resent the idea of having others—particularly their parents—in a position of authority when they start to become ill. In the extreme, it can feel like agreeing to have someone else take away your independence. These are understandable reactions shared by people with many other medical illnesses. For example, people with insulin-dependent diabetes dislike the idea that someone else might have to inject them if they go into shock. People with high blood pressure or cardiovascular diseases dislike the idea that a spouse might control their food or salt intake. Keeping in mind the issues listed in the personalized care tip, consider various ways to make the involvement of others feel more acceptable. First, remember that you’re asking them to step in when you get sick, not when you are healthy and competently running your day-to-day life. You may fear that if you let others control one difficult interval in your life, giving up control in other areas will soon follow. You may fear that your wife, husband, or partner will always be hovering over you and making sure you eat, sleep, work, and socialize according to his or ([Location 4799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=4799))

- her rules. But the truth is that you are giving up control over only a fragment of your life, and for only the brief period during which you are escalating into mania. In fact, you may want to make this point clear to them: that you are asking for help only when you become ill, not when you’re well. Second, try to involve people with whom you do not have a long history of control battles. If you have a history of severe conflicts with your mother or father over independence, involve your siblings or close friends instead. There may be members of your core circle whom you see frequently who would know if something was going wrong and whom you would trust with a degree of decision-making capacity during a time of crisis. A practical problem that can come up when relying on social supports is that no one in your core circle may see you often enough to know, within a brief time, whether you are showing the early warning signs of mania. If your relatives live far away or speak to you only by phone, they may not observe the subtle changes that constitute your manic escalation, or they may not have the practical resources (for example, access to your physician) to be able to help. Clients have handled this by relying more heavily on local friends or roommates to perform the same functions or by giving long-distance relatives the phone numbers of their therapist or physician, with instructions to call if the relative has concerns.

- It appears that many people with bipolar disorder can describe how they behave when they’re getting manic, at least when they’re asked after the fact. The harder question is, how do you know ahead of time what symptoms you should be looking for? One way to increase the probability that you or others will recognize a developing episode is to make a list, when you’re well, of early warning signs recalled from your last few episodes. In other words, take advantage of the greater insight you have into your illness when you are well. This kind of objectivity will be harder to summon when you are heading into an episode, but having the list available may help you view your escalating mood, thoughts, and behaviors in a different light. Soon I’ll talk about what you can actually do when these prodromal signs appear. ([Location 4898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=4898))

- Bipolar disorder makes managing money much harder than it would ordinarily be. When people are becoming manic, and especially when they reach the full height of their mania, they often go on spending sprees and invest wildly. In An Unquiet Mind, Jamison (1995) offers good examples of the thinking behind spending sprees. But as she recounts, spending sprees and foolish business investments can damage your life and contribute to your feelings of hopelessness after the manic episode has cleared. Mania tends to generate “hyperpositive thinking,” in which you overestimate your abilities to achieve (for example, make a lot of money) and underestimate the risks (for example, going into debt) of your behavior (Mansell & Pedley, 2008). When you have hyperpositive thoughts (for example, “I can’t possibly lose”), it can be hard to step back and evaluate them objectively. In fact, some people equate imagining being able to do something with actually being able to do it.

Depression is in an altogether different zone because it involves a complete absence: absence of affect, absence of feeling, absence of response, absence of interest.

- If you had a bad case of the flu, what would you do? Most of us would take time to convalesce and not expect too much of ourselves while recovering. Likewise, if you were suffering from chronic back pain, you would probably give yourself a break in terms of your physical expectations of yourself by declining to lift heavy objects, not sitting in the same position for hours, and selecting a “back-friendly” form of exercise. In all likelihood you would pay close attention to those things that helped alleviate your pain and avoid those that made it worse. Why don’t we do the same for ourselves when we’re in emotional pain? Emotional and social pain are processed by some of the same brain regions that process physical pain (Eisenberger, 2015). Try to think of bipolar depression in the same way you would think of a flu, chronic pain, or perhaps a long-term medical illness such as diabetes. No one would think of blaming a person with diabetes for not being able to control the way his or her body processed sugar.

- neurological (brain) variables. It is not the product of a character flaw, personality defect, or lack of moral fiber. Even the well-known explanatory concept of depression as the result of low self-esteem is suspect when talking about bipolar depression. Many people think that if you’re depressed, you must not think much of yourself. This low estimation might characterize the way you feel when you’re depressed, but you may feel quite differently about yourself when you’re well. In other words, low self-esteem is not a trait. Rather, it may just be a symptom of your depression. One of the leaders in our field, Dr. Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania, has compared self-esteem to a fuel gauge: It is a measure of how we’re doing at any one time—how much fuel is in the tank—which can change depending on what we are able to accomplish (Seligman, Reivich, Jaycox, & Gillham, 1996). Depression is not due to an unwillingness to accept responsibility, fears of coping with reality, laziness, cowardice, or weakness. It is an illness. To be sure, there are things you can do to make yourself feel better or at least stop your depression from worsening.

These involve changes in your behavior and thinking as well as in your relationships with others. You’ll see that some of the techniques involve distraction. Distraction means seeking out and engaging in activities that keep you busy, give you pleasure, draw your attention, and keep your mind off your pain and anguish. A related strategy is behavioral activation, in which you become more engaged with your environment, whether through outdoor exercise (for example, hiking, riding a bike), spending time with others whose company you enjoy, listening to music, reading, or visiting places that you haven’t been before, even if that is just a local coffee shop. The rewards that come from increased activation can improve your mood such that you want to do these things more often. Some of the coping strategies involve emotion-focusing.

- A fourth strategy, cognitive coping, involves learning to combat and challenge negative thinking patterns about specific situations or events (for example, self-blaming thoughts) and considering alternative ways to view these situations or events. As you’ll see, these strategies are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the people who recover most rapidly from bipolar depressive episodes seem able to sample from all four, using different strategies at different times.

- You are probably aware that mood states are affected by the things you tell yourself—by what we call cognitions or self-statements. Many studies have shown that negative thinking is associated with depressed and anxious moods. People with depression may have negative core beliefs about themselves (for example, “I’m not a likable person”), about people in general (for example, “People are generally motivated by selfish concerns”), and about their future (“I’m never going to accomplish my goals, be loved, or be healthy”). CBT for depression is based on the assumption that certain events provoke distorted automatic negative thoughts that reflect core beliefs about one’s unworthiness or unlovability (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1987). These automatic thoughts and core beliefs are important in causing and maintaining depressed mood and behaviors (for example, withdrawing from others). In cognitive restructuring, you hold your assumptions up to the light to see if they are logical and accurate or if there are other ways to make sense of your experiences. You may recall my discussion of CBT in Chapter 6; it is one of the most effective treatments for major depression and anxiety disorders.

- with good ones. Instead, it involves thinking up alternative or more balanced ways of understanding the things that have happened to you and looking at your situation from a number of different vantage points. A simple example: some people automatically blame themselves when someone else treats them badly, without considering the possibility that this other person is having a bad day or behaves in a similar manner with other people. In this section, I describe the method of cognitive restructuring and outline exercises to help you learn it. Like pleasurable activity scheduling, cognitive restructuring will probably have its greatest power once you have noticed the appearance of one or more depressive prodromal symptoms, before your depression gets really severe. It’s much harder to identify or challenge negative thoughts when you are in the midst of a severe depression. If you want to explore this method further, I suggest consulting the workbook Mind Over Mood by Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky (2015).

Some women with bipolar disorder go on to develop postpartum psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) within 4 weeks after they give birth, especially those who have had a manic episode triggered by sleep loss (Lewis et al., 2018). Postpartum psychosis can include homicidal fantasies about the infant. Women with postpartum psychosis need immediate treatment and often hospitalization.

- (depression). My high periods may last from a few days to a month or more. My low periods may last much longer, from several weeks to several months. About 1 in every 50 people has bipolar disorder. It most often affects a person for the first time in adolescence or young adulthood. What Are the Symptoms? My main symptoms during a high period may include feeling overly happy and excited or overly irritable and angry. I may also feel like I can do things that no one else can do (grandiosity). I may sleep less than usual or not at all, do many things at once (some of which seem goal driven and some not), have more energy, talk faster and express many ideas (some realistic and some unrealistic), and be easily distracted. I may do things that are impulsive when manic, like spend a great deal of money unwisely or drive recklessly. I may experience the symptoms of depression at other times, which can include feeling very sad, down, irritable, or anxious, losing interest in people or things, sleeping too much or being unable to sleep, having little or no appetite, having trouble concentrating or making decisions, feeling fatigued or low in energy, moving or talking slowly, feeling very bad or guilty about myself, or contemplating suicide or actually carrying out suicide attempts. How Does Bipolar Disorder Affect the Family? My bipolar disorder may affect my ability to relate to others in our family or in the work setting, especially when I become ill. Our family or relationship problems may be most apparent during or just after my episode of mania or depression, but then will probably improve as I get better. We can resolve our family conflicts through good communication and problem solving, emotional support for each other, and encouragement. We may want to get the additional help of a family or couple therapist or a family support group. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Having bipolar disorder means that I may have dysregulations in the emotional circuitry of the brain, especially the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. It’s possible that I inherited these dysregulations from my blood relatives, even if I can’t pinpoint who else in my family tree had it. My mood swings may also be affected by life stress or sudden changes in my sleep–wake habits. Nobody chooses to become bipolar. How Is Bipolar Disorder Treated? My treatment will probably include mood-stabilizing medications such as lithium, valproate (Depakote), or lamotrigine (Lamictal), or second-generation antipsychotic medications like risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), olanzapine (Zyprexa), lurasidone (Latuda), paliperidone (Invega), or asenapine (Saphris). I may also take antidepressant medications (for example, sertraline (Zoloft) or escitalopram (Lexapro) or drugs to control my anxiety or problems with sleep. These medications require that I see a psychiatrist regularly to make sure my side effects don’t get out of hand and, for some… ([Location 7202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=7202))

- Consider the role of problem solving when dealing with relatives who overmonitor your behavior. Can you develop agreements with them in which you do something to allay their anxiety, and they, in turn, agree not to watch you so closely? Bart, 18, was being constantly reminded by his mother, Greta, to take his medication and get his blood level checked. He got his revenge in a rather unproductive way: leaving lithium tablets around the house for her to find (for example, on the kitchen floor, behind the toilet, or under her pillow). Greta then became more annoyed and anxious and increased her monitoring of his behavior. Bart said that he was willing to take his medication and even have his blood level checked, but not if it meant that his mother “follows me around with pills in her hand.” Understandably, he wanted to feel like taking medication was his own decision. Greta expressed doubt that he would take lithium without her vigilance. She complained, “How can I know if he’s taking it if I don’t ask?” Through problem solving, Bart and his mother generated a list of possible scenarios: Bart taking full responsibility for his medication, Greta taking all the responsibility, Greta reminding him only once per day, Greta having more phone contact with his physician. Eventually they agreed that Greta would place Bart’s four daily lithium tablets on a plate for him in the morning. He agreed to take them during the day, and she agreed not to mention his medication unless she found pills on the plate or lying around the house by the day’s end. They also agreed that she could see his lithium level lab report whenever it became available. This agreement worked well for both of them.

- with time, they will change their behavior toward you. In other words, keep trying! Your repeated attempts at problem solving or diplomacy (for example, continuing to validate other people’s emotions even when they refuse to do so for you) will eventually have an impact on their responses, especially if you are able to stick with the formats outlined in the section Communication Skills for Reducing Criticism and Conflict (for active listening or making positive requests for change). Of course, this requires a high tolerance for frustration, but there is potentially a high payoff as well. To increase the chances that your relatives will improve their way of communicating with you, be sure to praise them for even minor attempts on their part (for example, “Thanks for asking me if I was upset after our conversation—I’m glad you noticed that it bothered me,” or simply, “Thanks for listening”). The chances are high that, over repeated discussions with your relatives, they will do or say something helpful or that shows an awareness of your viewpoint. Be ready to acknowledge their attempts to make things better, even if these attempts seem overshadowed by everything else they did that made you feel worse. Remember the cardinal rule of behavior modification: people increase the frequency of those behaviors that get rewarded by others.

The two biggest reasons for vocational impairments will not be surprising: being depressed and having cognitive impairments (Gitlin & Miklowitz, 2017).

- problems in mental flexibility (that is, when examining a problem, the ability to generate several ideas and alternative responses at once), verbal memory, and recall (Bonnín et al., 2010). Despite these somewhat depressing findings, there is an upside: if you have bipolar disorder, you can still be successful in your chosen career. A survey done by the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston University discovered that out of 500 professionals and managers previously diagnosed with a serious psychiatric illness (including nurses, newspaper reporters, corporate executives, lawyers, and professors), 73% were able to maintain full-time employment in their chosen occupations (Ellison, Russinova, Lyass, & Rogers, 2008). Of the respondents to the survey, 62% had worked in their position for more than 2 years, and 69% had increased their level of responsibility in their jobs. Most (84%) were taking some kind of psychiatric medication. Above all, respondents said that getting back to their jobs was important to their recovery. As the story of Louise illustrates, people with bipolar disorder face significant challenges in the workplace. Some of these challenges arise from the stigma of bipolar disorder and the reactions of others. Stigma after disclosures of illness is closely associated with unemployment in bipolar disorder (O’Donnell et al., 2017a, 2017b).

- As you’ve learned in previous chapters, one of the most salient characteristics of bipolar disorder is its instability and unpredictability. Your work performance may suffer most from its lack of consistency. You may wonder how you can promise consistency and accountability when you don’t know what your mood will be like on any given day. Your boss may complain that he or she can’t be sure whether a project will be done on time, forgetting that, during your hypomanic or manic phases, or even your between-episode healthy periods, you may be more productive than others in the same firm. You may resent the implication that only your depressed side is being acknowledged. A good strategy is to keep track of your work output (for example, what tasks you completed and when; how many customers you worked with) so that if you need to, you can document your overall output during a more extended period (Michalak et al., 2007). In my experience, people with bipolar disorder benefit from hypomania in the work setting only if they can harness it. Harnessing hypomania includes learning to recognize when you are moving or speaking too fast, setting limits on yourself when work starts to make you ([Location 7598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=7598))

- overly goal driven, trying to accomplish only one task at a time, accepting feedback from others about how you are coming across, and backing off when people seem to be reacting to your intensity. It may indeed be possible to translate your increased energy into work productivity, but also be aware of when you need to slow down and take a break. Self-Disclosure in the Workplace: “Should I Tell People about My Illness?” Can bipolar disorder be kept a secret? In my experience and that of many of my colleagues, people with bipolar disorder usually adopt one of five solutions regarding disclosure: They tell everybody about it, including their boss and coworkers. They disclose their illness to the human resources department so that accommodations can be arranged. They tell one or more trusted coworkers who do not carry positions of authority over them. They do not tell anybody, but do admit to bipolar disorder on their work-sponsored health insurance claims, leaving open the possibility that their employer could find out (although this is less risky since the advent of HIPAA).

There is no single solution that is right for everybody (although in most cases I’d encourage you to avoid the first option). Let me go through the pros and cons of telling employers or coworkers about your disorder to help you decide which option seems best for you in your current or future work environment.

- We also suspect that people with the disorder do better with consistent work hours and predictable workdays than in jobs requiring unpredictable and constantly shifting schedules (for example, working on weekdays one week and then weekends the next or working evening shifts followed immediately by morning ones). Jobs in restaurants, manufacturing, nursing, and retail sales often require variable shifts, whereas jobs in accounting, computer programming, banking, and schools are usually more consistent. But if the jobs in the former category appeal to you, you may not have to rule them out. Pursue them, but try to determine whether you can obtain some of the accommodations listed in the box below.

- PERSONALIZED CARE TIP: Volunteer work In my experience, people with bipolar disorder who have volunteered at an agency, shelter, or mental health facility while on disability or medical leave from their previous job almost invariably say that it was an important component of their recovery. When you are questioning why you should still be alive and wondering why your days seem monotonous and meaningless, volunteering in a “socially conscious” position can do much to lift your mood. Work can enhance your life in many ways even if you are not being compensated—by helping you structure your schedule and build new friendships and giving you a greater sense of purpose. Also, you may pick up some job skills and experience in working with other staffers, or even a letter of recommendation, that will be useful when you return to paid work. Annie, age 30, had a great love of animals, particularly dogs; her family had bred dogs when she was a child. She was less enthusiastic about her relationships with people, especially after her most recent mood crash, which had involved the breakup of a serious relationship and conflict with her parents. Once she felt up to it, she began volunteering at an animal shelter, at first for only 2 hours a week. The shelter director quickly recognized her passion and ability and suggested that she come aboard in a paid position. Although Annie preferred to volunteer until she felt better, the warm atmosphere of the shelter, combined with her enhanced feelings of self-worth, were essential components of her recovery.

- Despite the toll that bipolar disorder can take on your family and work life, I strongly believe that you can learn to cope effectively in both settings as well as in the broader community. As you’ve just seen, coping involves being comfortable with your own understanding of the disorder, educating others about it, knowing your limitations, setting appropriate expectations for yourself, and trying to adjust your environment to maximize the chances that you’ll function at your best. Remember to rely on the help of others (friends, family, and coworkers) for support when it seems appropriate. Constance Hammen and her colleagues at UCLA (Hammen, Gitlin, & Altshuler, 2000) found that the people with bipolar disorder who did best within the work setting were those who had strong social and relationship support outside of work. This book has emphasized self-management of the illness. But what should you (or your family members) do if you think one of your children has bipolar disorder, or is at risk for it? When do the same diagnostic criteria, prognosis, treatments, or illness management strategies apply, and when do they need to be different? This is the topic of the final chapter of this book.

- Let’s start with the question I hear most often: “If I have bipolar disorder, will my children develop it?” ([Location 7900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=7900))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you’re a mother and have bipolar disorder, the chances that your child will develop it are about 10%. The risk goes up to about 25% if we include risk for mood disorders in general, including major depression without mania and unspecified bipolar disorder, as well as the traditional bipolar I and II conditions (Craddock & Sklar, 2013). Importantly, the children of bipolar parents are more likely to develop depressive disorders over time (30–40% in some studies) than full bipolar I or II disorder (Duffy et al., 2014; Hillegers et al., 2005). Some studies find that the risk to offspring is higher when the parent developed bipolar disorder earlier (under age 21) rather than later (Hafeman et al., 2016; Vieta et al., 2018).

- Finally, I hope to help you balance your awareness of the signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder in your child with avoidance of “helicopter parenting.” I’ve seen many loving parents become hypervigilant when they first learn that their child is showing low-level symptoms and start scrutinizing the child for even minor mood shifts. They may ask teachers, friends’ parents, or athletic coaches to notify them of any explosive outbursts, tears, or irritability; or instances of talking fast, bragging, or doing too much. This approach is certainly understandable given the risks involved, but it has its downsides. It can lead you to exaggerate the significance of what you’re seeing and creates unnecessary strain on the child. In this chapter my goal is to give you an understanding of what to look for and what to do about your observations without centering your family’s life around the anticipation of an emerging illness.

- Their study was the first to suggest that the early signs of bipolar disorder could be observed during the teen years, before the onset of the full illness. Barbara Geller, a child psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis, did much to clarify the boundaries of childhood bipolar disorder in preadolescent and adolescent children (mean age 11) who came to treatment for a manic episode. She found that, like its adult counterpart, bipolar I disorder in kids waxed and waned between recurrences and recoveries, and kids were affected in their academic and social functioning (Geller et al., 2000). However, only 44% of the children Geller studied had a manic recurrence at an 8-year follow-up, when they were between the ages of 18 and 21. These findings suggest that, either because of treatment, environmental protective factors (for example, a warm family), or the natural developmental course of the illness, kids’ outcomes can be more positive than expected (Geller et al., 2008).

- You can be more confident now than 10–20 years ago that a standard psychiatric evaluation with an experienced practitioner will lead to an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, as a first step, seek an evaluation from a clinician who is familiar with childhood bipolar disorder and has a firm grasp of normal child development, so that age-appropriate behaviors don’t get attributed to the illness.

- Irritability: Bipolar Symptom or Distress Signal? Although it is often a symptom of manic and hypomanic episodes in children, irritability is also a symptom of other psychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, ODD, and major depression. It may be best thought of as a distress signal—a way for the child to communicate that he or she is anxious, depressed, confused, frustrated, or stressed from being unable to fulfill adult expectations. As noted earlier in the chapter, irritability is one of the key causes of the diagnostic confusion about childhood bipolar disorder: Manic episodes should not be confused with episodes of explosive anger. Anger outbursts are often precipitated by certain situations or stressors (such as sudden changes of plans) and may reflect an inability to regulate emotions (see the discussion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder below). Be very skeptical if a mental health professional tells you your child is bipolar because he or she has rage attacks. Currently, we think that irritability in a child is associated with mania only when it represents a clear departure from the child’s usual state and is episodic, meaning that it waxes and wanes in conjunction with other symptoms that define manic or depressive episodes. When irritability is chronic, we think it is likely to be a precursor of major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders in adulthood (Leibenluft, Cohen, Gorrindo, Brook, & Pine, 2006).

- You may have already heard of DMDD, especially if your child is male and has temper outbursts. This disorder was introduced in DSM-5 to provide a “diagnostic home” to children who were explosively angry and chronically irritable but did not otherwise fit the bipolar disorder criteria. This diagnosis has several core features in children and teens: (1) severe and recurrent temper outbursts that are clearly disproportionate to the situation, with verbal rages and/or physical aggressiveness (for example, breaking a window when denied a snack); (2) the temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level (the child is too old to have this kind of tantrum); (3) the outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week; and (4) in between these outbursts, the child is irritable, angry, sad, or anxious virtually every day for most of the day (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

- What can you do as a parent? As is true for any child, it is essential to encourage healthy eating habits at home, such as not using eating as a way of modulating anxiety, avoiding the urge to satisfy carbohydrate cravings, and avoiding snacking between meals. Needless to say, with teens this is easier said than done. Additionally, having depression can make the drive toward carbohydrates even stronger. I recommend Linda Craighead’s self-help guide, the Appetite Awareness Workbook (Craighead, 2006), as a place to start in helping your child learn strategies to control overeating.

- I’ve heard this question so many times that I put together a list that explains some of the key behavioral differences between “healthy teens” and bipolar teens; see the table below. Notice that bipolar disorder and teenage behavior are on a continuum: many mood symptoms can be found in isolation in ordinary teens, but without the other symptoms or functional impairments associated with full manic or depressive episodes.

- The good news, then, is that not all bipolar children grow up to be bipolar adults. Nor is it a given that your child will get worse with time or have ongoing impairments. Unfortunately, we do not have enough long-term data to say with certainty which kids will go on to have more mood episodes or how often the bipolar syndrome is a time-limited adolescent phenomenon. However, the great heterogeneity in outcomes in nearly every study suggests that there are risk or protective factors (see Chapter 3) that affect some kids more than others. The goal of personalized medicine is to find out what treatments fit best with which risk or protection profiles to maximize the chances of your child having the best possible outcome.

- If I’ve convinced you of one thing, it’s that parenting a child with bipolar disorder requires a very difficult balance. Parents often report high levels of distress and physical health problems (Perez Algorta et al., 2017). If you have bipolar disorder yourself, you may experience more symptoms when your child is symptomatic (like the bumper sticker that reads, “Mental illness is inherited—you get it from your kids”). And, as I said earlier, it’s equally true that children whose parents have mood disorders are more stable when their parents are more stable (Weissman et al., 2015). We don’t know which direction the causal arrow goes—from parent to child or child to parent—but in all likelihood it’s bidirectional. You may also be concerned about your other children, who may not have developed any symptoms yet. The risk of bipolar disorder in a sibling of a child with bipolar disorder averages 10–15%, similar to the rate of parent-to-child transmission (Craddock & Sklar, 2013). Siblings, however, may develop mental health disorders other than bipolar disorder—they may have acute stress reactions, depression, or anxiety that can be tied directly to what is happening with their brother or sister. It’s important to educate your other children about their sibling’s bipolar disorder. If your children are old enough, you may be able to use the Quick Fact Sheet in Chapter 13, which is designed to help family members understand bipolar disorder. If your children are younger, you will have to explain it in language they can understand. You may have to explain it to them several times and in different ways, but eventually they will absorb it. In my experience, children understand a lot more about mental health than we give them credit for. The key point is to communicate that the “well sibling” is not responsible for how her brother is acting (unless you suspect that she is purposely taunting him). Tell the sibling that you understand how hard it is when her brother has a “meltdown” or rages at her in a way that is out of proportion to the slight. “Your brother has problems with his moods. He gets really mad or really sad sometimes and he may take it out on you—but it’s not his fault and it’s not yours either” are good concepts to emphasize.

- better, and they help but they don’t always help right away.” Of course, your bipolar child may feel stigmatized by these conversations, so avoid getting into his personal details with siblings. Instead, give them enough information to enable them to try to empathize with their sibling’s emotional pain. Finally, if one of your non-bipolar children states that she is feeling neglected, or if her behavior is a transparent attempt to draw your attention, comment in a supportive way: “I know that sometimes we act like we aren’t listening when you tell us what’s going on with you, or you may think it’s unfair that we worry about Brad so much. I can understand why you feel that way, but Brad is having an especially rough time right now. We love you very much, and you can always tell me (us) about things that are important to you, good or bad.” ([Location 8618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FY5W22Y&location=8618))
