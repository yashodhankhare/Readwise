## Highlights
- His 1977 article “The Intuitive Psychologist and His Shortcomings” is the most widely cited article of the 1980s in social psychology. ([Location 10](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=10))

- I would find an article I really liked, and then read as many of the most interesting bits of the bibliography of that article as I could, and then the most interesting bits of the bibliography of those articles – and on and on, walking back the cat, as they say in the intelligence world. (You can kill a lot of afternoons at NYU library that way.) ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=164))

- What is so special about The Person and the Situation? You will, in short order, discover the answer to that yourself, and it is not my intention to ruin the fun. But let me offer a few short personal reflections. This is an ambitious book. It might be, in fact, one of the most ambitious books that I (or I imagine you) will ever read. That is the first of its many virtues. It offers a way of re-ordering ordinary experience. It argues that when we perceive the actions and intentions of others, we tend to make mistakes. We see things that aren’t there and we make predictions that we ought not to make: we privilege the “person” and we discount the influence of the “situation.” It speaks, in short, to the very broadest questions of human perception. I found this idea so disturbing and subversive that I think I have been wrestling with it ever ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=170))

- since. Just the other day, for example, I gave a short talk at a gathering of sports-types on one of my favorite topics – professional quarterbacks. I argued that the idea that quarterbacks can be ranked – that there is such a thing as a good quarterback and a not so good quarterback and that we can say, with certainty, that, say Peyton Manning is x number of points better than Brett Farve – is nonsense. A quarterback’s performance is inextricably tied up in his situation: in the quality of the players around him, his coaches, the skills of his receivers, the plays call for him – and on and on – and in trying to extract some notion of quarterback quality from that jumble of factors we are making an error. (Actually, a Fundamental Attribution Error.) I was making the kind of argument that people make once they’ve read The Person and the Situation.

- Social psychology stands at the intersection between our eyes and the world in front of us, and helps us understand the difference between what we think we see and what is actually out there. If you have ever felt the excitement of putting on a pair of glasses for the first time, and seeing the world suddenly jump into focus, then you have some sense of what is in store for you in the pages ahead. You are in for a treat. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=196))

- Finally, we are extremely grateful to Malcolm Gladwell for his interesting new foreword and for his kind remarks about the book and its role in his own career. He gives us too much credit. It has been his skill as a writer, and his insight about our field, that accounts for his personal success and the resurgence of popular interest in our field. He is indeed an outlier whose efforts have created a tipping point for social psychology. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=220))

- Social psychology rivals philosophy in its ability to teach people that they do not truly understand the nature of the world. This book is about that hard-won ignorance and what it tells us about the human condition. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=312))

- Even scientists who are most concerned with assessing individual differences in personality would concede that our ability to predict how particular people will respond in particular situations is very limited. This “predictability ceiling” is typically reflected in a maximum statistical correlation of .30 between measured individual differences on a given trait dimension and behavior in a novel situation that plausibly tests that dimension. This ceiling, for example, would characterize our ability to predict on the basis of a personality test of honesty how likely different people will be to cheat in a game or on an exam, or to predict on the basis of a test of friendliness or extroversion how much sociability different individuals will show at a particular social gathering. Now a correlation of .30, as we will emphasize later, is by no means trivial. Correlations of this magnitude can be quite important for many prediction purposes. But a correlation of .30 still leaves the great bulk of variance in people’s behavior unaccounted for. More importantly, a correlation of this magnitude is a good deal lower than it would have to be to provide the type of predictability that most laypeople anticipate when they make predictions about each other’s behavior or make inferences about others’ personal attributes. Moreover, the .30 value is an upper limit. For most novel behaviors in most domains, psychologists ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=332))

- cannot come close to that. Certainly, as we will see, neither the professional nor the layperson can do that well when obliged to predict behavior in one particular new situation on the basis of actions in one particular prior situation. Despite such evidence, however, most people staunchly believe that individual differences or traits can be used to predict how people will behave in new situations. Such “dispositionism” is widespread in our culture. What is more, most of us, scientists and laypeople alike, seem to find our dispositionism affirmed by our everyday social experience. The challenge of accounting for this discrepancy between beliefs about everyday experience on the one hand and empirical evidence on the other hand is one of the most important faced by psychologists. We will deal with it at many points in this book. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=342))

- People’s inflated belief in the importance of personality traits and dispositions, together with their failure to recognize the importance of situational factors in affecting behavior, has been termed the “fundamental attribution error” ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=366))

- Nowhere is the weakness of apparently big situational factors more perplexing than in studies of the impact of various real-life events on important social outcomes. For some of these weak effects we can be grateful. For example, it turns out that in most cases the long-term impact of physical and sexual abuse suffered in childhood is relatively slight (Widom, 1989), as is the long-term effect of teenage pregnancy on a young woman’s life outcomes (Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn, & Morgan, 1987), and even the long-term effect of P.O.W. camp indoctrination (Schein, 1956). Unfortunately, apparently positive events sometimes also prove to be surprisingly weak in their ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=373))

- effect. For example, the lives of major lottery winners seem to be influenced far less by their windfalls than most of us would predict, especially when we imagine how much our own lives would be changed by a similar windfall (Brickman, Coates, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978).

- The life outcomes of boys in these different categories were then examined in a follow-up study 40 years later. On indicator after indicator – for example, income, mental health, prison incarcerations, suicides, and the like – the status of the subjects’ home situation as children made little if any difference. What do we learn from these spectacular noneffects? Certainly not that situational factors are unimportant in the world outside the social psychology laboratory. As we will see beginning in Chapter 2, many realworld effects turn out to be huge – from the dramatic personal changes wrought ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=398))

- by immersing conservative young women in highly liberal surroundings (Newcomb, 1943), to the pronounced effect of competition on group conflict (Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, & Sherif, 1961). Conversely, it is not only in the “real world” that situational factors and manipulations sometimes prove to be surprisingly small or nonexistent. It is the studies with detectable effects that get published, and the subset of the studies with large and unanticipated effects that become well known. The others languish in file drawers. We wish we had a dollar for every failed laboratory manipulation that social psychologists have designed with the confident expectation that the effects in question would be significant. What we have learned, in short, is that situational effects can sometimes be far different from what our intuitions, or theories, or even the existing psychological literature tell us they should be. Some factors that we expect to be very important prove to be trivial in their impact; and some factors that we expect to be weak prove, at least in some contexts, to exert a very large influence indeed. Accounting for our poor “calibration” as to the size of the effects produced by situational factors is a major focus of the education of the social psychologist and a chief concern of this book.

- As we have seen, the evidence of empirical social psychology often conflicts sharply with what we “know” from everyday life. To be sure, we are sometimes surprised by the behavior of our fellow human beings, or by a genuinely unexpected act on the part of one of our children, or one of our friends, or some public figure. But for the most part the world seems an orderly, predictable place. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=423))

- We believed that human beings are adept at seeing things as they believe them to be, at explaining away contradictions and, in particular, at perceiving people as more consistent than they really are. While we continue to believe that such biased processing of evidence plays an important role in perceptions of consistency, we now believe that the predictability of everyday life is, for the most part, real. At the same time, we believe that many of the principles and intuitions that people use to explain and predict behavior are unreliable. That is, people often make correct predictions on the basis of erroneous beliefs and defective prediction strategies.

- And so it is for social psychology. Our intuitive ideas about people and the principles governing their responses to their environment are generally adequate for most purposes of the office and the home; but they are seriously deficient when we must understand, predict, or control behavior in contexts that lie outside our most customary experience – that is, when we take on new and different roles or responsibilities, encounter new cultures, analyze newly arisen social problems, or contemplate novel social interventions to address such problems. When we go from being students to being professionals, when we bargain with a street vendor 5,000 miles from home, or when our community begins a new program to deal with crack addiction or homelessness, the inadequacies of lay principles are likely to be revealed. Much of what we wish to do in this book involves describing how lay social psychology differs from scientific social psychology. In this task we will identify three principles as the major cumulative insights of our field – a kind of tripod that provides the foundation for our collective enterprise. The first principle concerns the power and subtlety of situational influences. The second involves the importance of people’s subjective interpretations of the situation. The third speaks to the necessity of understanding both individual psyches and social groups as tension systems or energy “fields” characterized by an equilibrium between impelling and restraining forces. We will sketch these principles here briefly and then illustrate their application throughout the rest of the book.

- The Principle of Situationism Our discussion of situationism in social psychology must begin with an introduction to Kurt Lewin, a German emigrant who came to the United States in the mid-1930s. His contributions over the next decade redefined the field of social psychology and continue even today to exert a profound effect on its major theoretical and applied traditions. Lewin’s general theoretical formulation began with the familiar truism that behavior is a function of the person and the situation (or, in Lewin’s terms, a function of the “life space,” which includes both the individual and the individual’s psychological representation of the environment). Despite the evenhandedness of Lewin’s formulation, which cites the joint influence of situational and dispositional determinants of behavior, it was the power of the immediate social situation that was featured in his empirical work and that of his students. Lewin’s particular concern was the capacity of situational factors, and social manipulations, to influence patterns of behavior that normally are seen as reflective of personal dispositions and preferences. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=456))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When trying to get people to change familiar ways of doing things, social pressures and constraints exerted by the informal peer group represent the most potent restraining force that must be overcome and, at the same time, the most powerful inducing force that can be exploited to achieve success. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=476))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- An equally important part of Lewin’s situationism was a healthy respect for apparently minor but actually important details of the situation. He often called these “channel factors” because they referred to small but critical facilitators or barriers. Lewin recognized that behavior often is produced by the opening up of some channel (for example, by public commitment to a course of action, or by taking a halting first step in the direction of some new behavior) and sometimes is blocked by the closing of some channel (for example, by failure to formulate a specific plan to carry out a concrete action at an opportune moment). ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=481))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The channel factor principle, thus, is one key to understanding why some situational factors have bigger effects than might be anticipated and why some have smaller effects. Seemingly big interventions and campaigns that provide no effective input channel in the form of situational pressures, or no effective behavioral outlet channel in the form of clear intentions or plans, will generally produce disappointingly small effects. And seemingly small situational factors that operate on important input or output channels will often exert gratifyingly large effects.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The second enduring contribution of social psychology, ironically, is one that challenges the theoretical and practical value of the doctrine of situationism. The impact of any “objective” stimulus situation depends upon the personal and subjective meaning that the actor attaches to that situation. To predict the behavior of a given person successfully, we must be able to appreciate the actor’s construal of the situation – that is, the manner in which the person understands the situation as a whole. Construal issues are similarly important if our goal is to control or change behavior. Many well-intentioned, even well-conceived, social interventions fail because of the way in which they are construed by the targeted group (for example, as an insulting and stigmatizing exercise in co-option or paternalism). ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=508))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In this book we will once again devote attention to how construal influences behavior and how construal works. But our primary concern here is not documenting that subjective construal occurs or that it matters in determining how people will respond to their environment. What we seek to establish is that laypeople consistently fail to make sufficient allowance for the role that construal plays in determining behavior, a failure with profound personal and social consequences. In particular, we will argue that ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=533))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- people make three distinct but related errors about construal. The first error is a failure to recognize the degree to which one’s own understanding of stimuli is the result of an active, constructive process, rather than a passive reception and registering of some external reality. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=536))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The second error is the failure to appreciate the inherent variability of situational construal. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=543))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The third error concerns causal attributions for behavior. People fail to recognize the extent to which observed actions and outcomes, especially surprising or atypical ones, may prove to be diagnostic not of the actor’s unique personal dispositions but rather of the objective situational factors facing the actor and of the actor’s subjective construals of those factors.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Social psychology’s third major contribution, and the remaining leg of the conceptual tripod upon which our field rests, is the principle that individual psyches, as well as collectivities ranging from the informal social group to the nation, must be understood as systems in a state of tension. The analysis of any given stimulus situation must include the recognition first that “behavior has to be derived from a totality of coexisting facts,” and second that “these coexisting facts have the character of a dynamic field insofar as the state of any part of this field depends on every other part of the field” (Lewin, 1951, p. 25). No simple mechanistic laws relating particular stimuli to particular responses are possible, given that both are always embedded in dynamic contexts that alter and constrain their effects.

- . such phenomena as the speed of production in a factory are the result of a multitude of forces. Some forces support each other, some oppose each other. Some are driving forces, others restraining forces. Like the velocity of a river, the actual conduct of a group depends upon the level (for instance, the speed of production) at which these conflicting forces reach a state of equilibrium. To speak of a certain culture pattern ... implies that the constellation of these forces remains the same for a period or at least that they find their state of equilibrium at a constant level during that period. (Lewin, 1951, p. 173) ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=566))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are three major contributions of the tension system notion. The first is that an analysis of restraining factors can be as important to understanding and anticipating the effects of a newly introduced stimulus as an analysis of the stimulus itself. The effect of introducing a new monetary incentive for production in a factory depends on the balance of forces maintaining production at the current level. If there is a group norm against overproduction or “rate-busting,” the incentive may have little effect or even a reverse effect. The dynamic contest between opposing forces was nicely captured by Wolfgang Koehler’s concept of the “quasistationary equilibrium.” ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=571))

- The social psychologist who applied the tension system notions to the most impressive effect was Leon Festinger. Festinger (1954; Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950) recognized that individual human attitudes are best understood as existing in a state of tension in relation to the attitudes of members of the face-to-face groups to which each person belongs. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=611))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- People do not like the state of being in disagreement with their fellows, and when they discover that this is the case, three balance-restorative processes are instituted – attempts to change others’ opinions so as to move them into line with one’s own, receptivity to others’ similar attempts to change one’s attitude, and a tendency to reject others from the group to the extent that they refuse to move toward the central tendency of opinion in the group. Festinger derived many interesting social phenomena from the operation of these processes, which we will begin to discuss in the next chapter. Festinger also regarded attitudes within the head of the individual as existing in a state of tension. Some attitudes support each other; some contradict each other. Contradictory attitudes exist in a state of tension, called “dissonance,” which must be resolved. One attitude or the other must be changed until the system is restored to a state of balance (see Festinger, 1957; Aronson, 1969). Festinger’s most dramatic use of the tension system notion was for cases in which the two cognitive elements in conflict are an attitude and a behavior. This occurs when someone does something that follows neither from the attitudes the person holds nor from some extrinsic force such as the expectation of reward. Festinger showed that in such a situation ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=614))

Thus if someone is maneuvered into delivering a speech that happens not to reflect the person’s prior beliefs, and if the person is paid little or nothing for doing so, the person’s expressed attitudes move in the direction of the position taken in the speech. This movement is blocked if the person is paid a substantial amount for delivering the speech.

- In short, our overall thesis, developed in detail in Chapter 6, is that some of the layperson’s most fundamental assumptions about personal consistency and predictability are validated by everyday experience, even though the basis for such consistency may be misunderstood by the perceiver. Thus, despite the demonstrable errors and biases of lay prediction, the world as it is experienced daily is, in fact, a reasonably predictable place. Lay psychology, like lay physics, generally gets the job done reasonably well using dramatically mistaken principles; and when it fails, it will generally be for reasons that rather deep principles of our discipline allow us to understand and sometimes even anticipate.

- OVERVIEW AND PLAN OF THE BOOK In summary, this is a book about the predictability and coherence of behavior as seen from the perspective of modern experimental and cognitive social psychology. We begin with the history of research suggesting that situational factors often prove to be more powerful determinants of behavior than the vast majority of US scientists and laypeople alike would have guessed. Implicit in this situationist lesson is the suggestion that people from different backgrounds, people with different beliefs, even people with apparently different personalities, must understand and react to some situations rather uniformly. In other words, there are at least some important respects in which human beings prove to be more alike than we generally reckon them to be. At the same time, research and everyday observation constantly remind us that people often do differ dramatically both in their responses to particular situations and events and in the patterns of their everyday behavior. We will argue that the shared convictions that laypeople have about stable, consistent, coherent, and predictable individual differences are not always mere cognitive illusions. Rather, they are based, at least to a substantial degree, on the data of everyday experience. Far from disputing the existence or significance of individual differences, we will acknowledge them and then explore their bases and implications. More specifically, we will provide a “situationist” and “subjectivist” account of individual differences – one that gives heavy weight to the complex dynamics of social systems and to the role of construal processes. Our goal will thus be an account of individual differences that seeks to explain what kinds of differences are likely to exist and be important, when they are likely to be obscured, and when ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=790))

- In Europe a few years ago, hundreds of angry British soccer fans attacked rival Italian fans and caused a wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring 400. Though we recoil from such behavior and denounce it, we do not understand it. We tend to assimilate such behavior to the case of individual aggression, failing to recognize that the situation that results in mob violence has properties that cannot be predicted from ordinary life situations or from knowledge of the life histories of the participants.

- This chapter’s review of classic studies of social influence and situational control will emphasize two themes: first, that social pressures and other situational factors exert effects on behavior that are more potent than we generally recognize, and second, that to understand the impact of a given social situation, we often need to attend to its subtle details.

- Sherif’s implicit message, however, was not simply that in the face of uncertainty or ambiguity people give weight to the judgments of their peers. Rather, it was that our most basic perceptions and judgments about the world are socially conditioned and dictated. And it was precisely this radical suggestion that Solomon Asch, long a student both of perception and of social influence processes (Asch, 1940), initially sought to challenge by replacing the “autokinetic” paradigm with an experimental procedure that now bears his name (Asch, 1951, 1952, 1955, 1956).

- Asch, it is worth noting, initially expected that the vast majority of his subjects would show the courage of their convictions (or at least the confidence of their perceptions) by remaining independent in the face of the unanimous majority. This expectation proved to be incorrect, however. Notwithstanding the simple and concrete nature of the perceptual judgment task, subjects typically manifested obvious conflict and discomfort, and not infrequently, they conformed. In fact, anywhere from 50 ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=911))

- percent to 80 percent of the subjects (the actual proportion varied from study to study) yielded to the erroneous majority at least once, and overall, conformity occurred on over a third of all critical trials.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In follow-up studies, Asch quickly discovered two important facts. First, the size of the unanimous majority in his paradigm did not have to be particularly large. Indeed, Asch found that conformity rates did not decrease significantly when the number of confederates was reduced from eight to a number as small as three or four. (It is worth noting, in light of Sherif’s earlier results, that a group consisting of a subject and two confederates prompted relatively little conformity; and when only a single confederate was employed, there was virtually no evidence of social influence at all.) On the other hand, the erroneous majority did have to be unanimous. When the target subject was provided with a single ally who remained independent, both the percentage of conforming subjects and the frequency with which they conformed dropped precipitously – even when the naive subject and the ally were confronted with seven or eight judges who all expressed a different opinion. Although initially surprised, Asch was never tempted to conclude that basic perceptions of physical reality can be socially dictated. To defend his position, Asch pointed out that roughly a third of his subjects had never conformed at all, and that another third had defied the unanimous majority more often than they had yielded. More importantly, he insisted (using postexperimental interviews to buttress his case) that when conformity had occurred in the face of social influence, it was not because the subjects’ perceptions had been altered. On the contrary, the subjects had conformed despite their private perceptions, either because they believed that their perceptions must be somehow wrong and those of the unanimous majority correct, or because they were unwilling to be a lone dissenter even when they were quite certain that the majority was wrong.

- While Asch’s interpretations were convincing and his follow-up studies enlightening, it was his basic empirical result – the willingness of so many individuals to deny even the unambiguous evidence of their senses rather than stand alone against the group – that captured the imagination of Asch’s contemporaries and that continues to challenge us today.

- Substantial conformity could be shown to occur even in the Asch situation – a situation in which the ease and objectivity of the task and the relative absence of group power to reward or punish should have served to minimize conformity pressures. Therefore (so the argument went) could we not expect even greater conformity to occur in everyday situations in which ambiguous matters of opinion are discussed by group members who have reason to respect each ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=940))

Like all classic experiments that challenge our intuitions and preconceptions, the Asch experiments prompt questions about generalizability and significance.

And even if they were not laboratory artifacts, what do they really teach us about the explanation, prediction, and control of human behavior?

- These studies demonstrated again and again that arbitrarily constructed groups, even ones that hold no long-term power to reward conformity or punish dissent, can exert potent conformity pressures. On the other hand, the ease of demonstrating massive conformity should not prompt us to conclude from the Asch phenomenon that people are sheep, that they are somehow dispositionally inclined to join the majority chorus rather than allow their discordant note to stand out. Although more or less the conventional view of Asch’s contemporaries, such a conclusion would ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=961))

- reflect the fundamental attribution error we decry throughout this book. To rebut the “people are sheep” interpretation, we need only remind the reader, as Asch did, that most of his subjects, most of the time, did not conform. We also must note how drastically conformity in the Asch situation declined when the majority, even a very large majority, was not unanimous. Both of these results suggest that people often are quite willing to express a minority view. At worst, they find dissent difficult when they have no comrades who will do likewise. But we don’t need laboratory findings to prove that people can and do dissent in the face of pressure to conform. We can all cite cases in which we ourselves, or others with whom we are familiar, have willingly expressed dissenting opinions – indeed, done so under circumstances where the potential cost of dissent would seem, at least at first consideration, to have been considerably greater than any that might have been anticipated by potential dissenters in the Asch situation.

- The question of when, and why, people are willing to dissent was pursued by Ross, Bierbrauer, and Hoffman (1976), who analyzed the Asch situation in terms of the participants’ causal attributions. Essentially, Ross and his colleagues argued, people who must choose between conformity and dissent almost always can cite reasons for their differing views. They can point to differences in goals, incentives, available information, or prior suppositions, differences that both would cause rational people to disagree and allow them to justify that disagreement. The Asch situation, by contrast, was unique in that it offered potential dissenters no way of accounting for their peers’ apparently erroneous but unanimous judgment. To the subjects, the correct judgment appeared so obvious that only fools or mad people could err, and they had every reason to… ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=973))

- to their peers as their peers’ judgments were to them. Their own dissent, in fact, would represent a challenge to the collective competence of their peers – a challenge one is particularly loath to offer when one’s own ability to make sense of one’s world suddenly seems to be in question. To test this attributional analysis, Ross and his colleagues recreated a version of the Asch situation in which subjects made simple judgments about the relative lengths of two tones. They showed that subjects became much more willing to dissent on critical trials when there were different consequences for being wrong in one way than in the other. Subjects knew that on critical trials the apparently incorrect judgment, if it happened to be correct, would yield a high payoff for the individual who made it, whereas the apparently correct judgment… ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=980))

- critical trials provided a plausible explanation for the apparent disagreement. Subjects could reason that “their judgment, but not mine, was distorted by the prospect of a large payoff instead of a small one,” or even that “they apparently thought it was worth playing a long shot; I don’t.” In other words, the introduction of the asymmetric matrix eliminated the most distinctive and potent feature of the Asch situation, which is the total absence of any suitable way for the naive subjects to explain the apparent discrepancy in perception. Pondering the meaning of the Asch studies and of the factors that influence conformity remains a fresh and interesting activity even for psychologists long familiar with the work. But regardless of the interpretations preferred for the various findings by different psychologists, all are agreed that… ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=987))

- Sherif’s social influence studies derived from the ideas of an important nineteenth-century situationist whose impact on the social sciences was felt far less in psychology than in political science, economics, and sociology. The situationist in question was Karl Marx, who, over a century ago (Marx, 1859/1904), noted that “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their social being, but on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness” (p. 10).

- The 1960s were filled with events that made many feel that America’s social fabric was unraveling. What caught the eye of Darley and Latané, however, was a rash of attacks on women in which no one came to the victim’s aid. One such incident in particular received great national attention. Over a 30-minute period in Kew Gardens, a middleclass section of Queens, New York, a woman named Kitty Genovese was stabbed repeatedly by an assailant. Though she shouted for help continually during that time, and despite the fact (as police later were able to establish) that at least 38 people heard her and were aware of the incident, no one intervened in any way. No one even called the police! ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1125))

- The news media, never at a loss to explain human behavior, were unanimous in attributing the neighbors’ lack of intervention to increasing alienation and apathy among dwellers in the megalopolis. Darley and Latané, trained in the situationist and subjectivist traditions of their field, thought otherwise. They hypothesized that in this incident, and in scores of others in which groups of bystanders failed to help victims of accidents, illnesses, or crimes (even in circumstances that would have exposed them to no danger or other significant costs), potential altruists had been inhibited not by indifference but rather by important aspects of the social situation. In particular, they had been inhibited by the presence of other potential altruists, and by their apparent failure to intervene in the same situation. Group situations, Darley and Latané argued, can inhibit bystander intervention in two ways. First, and most obvious, is the dilution or diffusion of responsibility that each person feels because of the presence of ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1130))

- others (“Why should I be the one to intervene, especially if no one else is? I’d be willing to do my share, but not to take on all the responsibility myself”). Second, and less obvious, is the construal or social definition problem to be dealt with in more general terms in our next chapter. That is, to the extent that there is ambiguity either about the nature of the situation or the nature of the appropriate response to that situation, the failure of other people to act serves to support interpretations or construals that are consistent with nonintervention (“it must just be a domestic dispute,” or “she must not be hurt as badly or be in as much danger as she seems,”; or alternatively, “I guess this must be one of those situations where it’s inappropriate, maybe even dangerous, to get involved, the kind of situation that prudent and sophisticated people steer clear of!”). In a sense, a vicious circle is initiated. The presence of other people inhibits quick intervention, and that initial lack of intervention supports definitions of the situation that make intervention seem unnecessary, unwise, or inappropriate, which in turn prompts further reluctance and delays, and so forth. By contrast, if the bystander is alone, and there is no one else to share the responsibility to intervene or to… ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1137))

In the movie Midnight Cowboy a naive young man comes from the range to the streets of Manhattan. Just off the bus, and walking through great throngs of people, he comes across a man lying on the sidewalk. He starts to reach down to see what’s wrong with the man, then looks around him at the people walking past. They steer around the man on the sidewalk as they might avoid a log lying on a trail. The young man expresses surprise, then consternation, then shrugs his shoulders and goes about his business like the others.

- One cannot witness such a scene without being reminded of one’s own experiences of apathy and indifference in the megalopolis. But it should be helpful to ask oneself if New Yorkers, or Bostonians, or Philadelphians seem any less moved than their compatriots in Sioux Falls, Iowa, by the sufferings of stray cats, or by the fate of miners trapped in cave-ins, or by the plight of an abused and neglected child, or by the struggle of a young athlete stricken with a deadly variety of cancer. In our experience the answer is no. People are no more callous about such matters in one place than in another. To explain why urbanites walk around unfortunates lying in the street, or why they fail to investigate or call the police when they hear screams from an adjacent apartment, we need to look to the specifics of the relevant social situations, including, of course, the behavioral norms that are explicitly and implicitly communicated as these intervention opportunities continually present themselves.

Over the long haul, the average of the opinions of any two people is more likely to be correct than the opinion of either individual. To attend to the “base rate” of other people’s opinions is only rational, and people who do this too little are aptly regarded as opinionated or reckless.

An interesting implication of this derivation of conformity pressures is that it is not just majority opinions that should be influential, but minority opinions as well.

And indeed, recent work by both Moscovici and his colleagues (Moscovici, Lage, & Naffrechoux, 1969; Moscovici & Personnaz, 1980) and Nemeth (1986) establishes that not all conformity is to majority opinion.

This will produce opinion deviance, which will be met with forces toward uniformity by the group.

In the case of social influence, the dissonance exists between one’s own view and the views (as well as the conformity requirements) of the group. This dissonance is characteristically resolved in favor of the group’s view, often not by simple compromise, but by wholesale adoption of the group’s view and suppression of one’s own doubts. The consequences of this sort of dissonance reduction are revealed in Irving Janis’s (1982) well-known analysis of disastrous military and political decisions resulting from “groupthink.” That is, loyal group members suppress their doubts about a planned course of action, thereby giving an illusion of consensus that in turn discourages believers and doubters alike from exploring flaws in the proposal and considering alternatives.… ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1231))

- Christian evangelists show a similar sensitivity to the importance of channel factors. Instead of a vague and general appeal to change one’s ways or to accept Christ as one’s personal savior, the evangelist asks for a single concrete act at that exact moment in time, for example, to get out of one’s seat and come forward as a sign of one’s decision (after which a cadre of volunteers will lead the newcomers backstage and induce further acts of commitment). Successful evangelists, it is worth noting parenthetically, do not always rely only on channel facilitation. Some also make effective use of social influence techniques consistent with the message of the first half of this chapter. In particular, they employ models – explicitly instructed volunteers who immediately stand in response to the evangelist’s appeal, thereby “getting the ball rolling” and making it more normative for others to rise to their feet (and, eventually, rather uncomfortable to remain seated).

- In Chapter 5 we will show that such situational influences tend to be far greater than most people are willing to predict. We can also note that scores of studies have probed additional situational determinants of altruistic behavior (and quite a few have looked for the personality characteristics of the altruist). The results of some of these studies have been fairly intuitive. Bryan and Test (1967), for example, showed that the presence or absence of altruistic “models” (peers who rendered the sought-after assistance in similar or identical circumstances) produced corresponding increases or decreases both in subjects’ willingness to help motorists in distress and in their generosity when faced with a Salvation Army collection kettle. Other studies have produced more surprising, and often more complicated, results. For example, many studies have shown that mood inductions, either of “guilt” (Carlsmith & Gross, 1968) or “happiness” (Isen, Clark, & Schwartz, 1976; Isen, Shalker, Clark, & Karp, 1978) can markedly increase subjects’ willingness to comply with requests for help or to show other altruistic behaviors. But none, we believe, can drive home the situationist message in general, and the importance of channel factors in particular, as pointedly as Darley and Batson’s simple study.

- One of the most potent strategies, it has become apparent, consists of inducing people to take initial small, seemingly inconsequential steps along a path that ultimately will lead them to take much larger and more consequential actions. All of us, in fact, have had personal experiences that illustrate the relevant principle. We agree to help someone in some limited way or to undertake some small responsibility.

- would have predicted, or ever would have agreed to before becoming involved. The principle in question, when applied by a skilled interpersonal manipulator, consists of first getting one’s “foot in the door,” that is, asking for a small favor or commitment (one that, in the context at hand, can scarcely be refused), and only then asking for the larger commitment or undertaking that constitutes the real objective. Jonathan Freedman and Scott Fraser (1966) illustrated this principle very elegantly in an experiment that has become a classic. Homemakers in a middle-class housing tract near the Stanford University campus were first approached by a person who asked them to do something relatively innocuous, that is, either to sign a petition or to place a small (3 inches square) sign in the window of their car or home promoting a noncontroversial cause (for example, safe driving). The vast majority of those approached, not surprisingly, agreed to this seemingly modest request.

He asked them to allow a large, crudely lettered, and decidedly ugly “Drive Carefully” sign to be installed directly in front of their house. As he made this request, he showed them a photo in which the ugly sign could be seen obscuring the front door of another house in the tract. The results of this study were dramatic. Fully 76 percent of the subjects who had initially agreed to place a small auto safety sign in their window now agreed to place the big, ugly “Drive Carefully” sign in front of the house. By contrast, “only” 17 percent (actually, a surprisingly large percentage in absolute terms) agreed to erect the sign when there had been no prior foot-in-the-door visit. Interestingly, even when the issue pertinent to the subjects’ initial compliance was irrelevant to the subsequent request (for example, when they initially had accepted a window sign, or signed a petition, that sought to “Keep California Beautiful”), ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1329))

- As always, contextual details, sometimes very subtle details, matter a great deal, and some talent (or better still, some pretesting) is required to figure out what kinds of initial requests are most likely to facilitate which kinds of later compliance. But the fact remains that careful use of initial commitments and other channel manipulations can lead people ultimately to take steps that no one, least of all they themselves, would have predicted from their previous behavior or from their previous expressions of their views. Rather than attempting to offer any simple formula for using foot-in-the-door or other minimal compliance manipulations, we should consider briefly the explanation that researchers who employ them offer ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1346))

- for their effectiveness. Basically, they argue either that the small acts of compliance motivate subjects to adopt attitudes consonant with such behavior (Festinger, 1957) or that these acts help to “inform” the subjects about the nature and degree of their heretofore unexamined and untested views (Bem, 1972). Whether the subjects rationalize their prior behavior, or simply use it as a clue as to their real attitudes and priorities, the result is a subsequent willingness to act accordingly, for example, to make further commitments or take further actions appropriate for one who holds those attitudes. We think that these cognitive explanations are correct, at least in part, but we think it is also important to emphasize that such explanations really explain very little unless they tacitly grant one of the central contentions of this chapter and of our book as a whole: People are prone not only to be influenced by situational factors but also to underestimate the extent of such influence (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Ross, 1977).

- Putting It All Together: Stanley Milgram and the Banality of Evil In 1965 the moral philosopher Hannah Arendt announced her thesis that the Holocaust, or at any rate its day-to-day implementation, owed more to bureaucratic blandness and indifference than to sadistic pleasure in the suffering of the innocent. She came to this conclusion after watching the trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann, the man charged with overseeing the transportation of Europe’s Jewry to the death camps. What she saw in the docket (in the bulletproof glass cage, actually – Israeli security was… ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1360))

- following orders, and that he never cared much one way or the other about what happened to the people he transported to the camps in central Europe. Arendt was willing to believe that Eichmann was not a sadistic monster but a conformist without a cause, that he could as easily have been in charge of shipping vegetables, or more to the point, that many a vegetable shipper could have been induced to play Eichmann’s monstrous role. We share the suspicions of the social critic Alfred Kazin (1984) that Arendt may have too readily accepted at face value the only defense left to a man who could not plausibly deny either that he was who he was or that he did what he did. “Just following orders” has always been the defense of underlings who commit evil deeds in the name of the state. At the same time, we cannot help commending Arendt’s willingness to resist the easier and more commonplace conclusion that heinous acts must be the product of heinous motives. For, as we have emphasized, the tendency to make unwarranted leaps from acts to corresponding dispositions is perhaps the most fundamental and most common failing of social inference. Whether Eichmann was a fiend, we do not know; that there were many Germans who were not fiends yet knowingly played a role in sending the victims of Naziism to their horrible fates, we do not doubt. It is certainly the case that many Nazi concentration camp guards led blameless lives, both before and after their horrible service (Steiner, 1980). To explain such complicity, therefore, we must assume the existence of a specific social and situational context that could induce ordinary people to commit extraordinarily evil deeds. As it happens, at roughly the same time Arendt was developing her thesis about the banality of evil, Stanley Milgram was demonstrating it in his laboratory. As we described earlier, Milgram had previously done follow-up work on the Asch paradigm showing that people would conform to a unanimous majority even when they thought that they were testing airliner signaling systems. He had then gone on, using the same paradigm, to study cultural differences in conformity (and, in fact, to provide some support for the ethnic stereotype that the “contentious” French would show less conformity than the “more retiring” Scandinavians). These results, in turn, made Milgram wonder whether similar cultural differences would… ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1366))

They were not impressionable college sophomores; rather (at least in his best-known studies), they were adult males of varied occupations who had responded to a newspaper advertisement soliciting participants for a study on learning to be conducted at Yale University. Let us now consider the details of Milgram’s unfolding experimental scenario. Upon their arrival, Milgram’s subject meets another “subject,” a pleasant-mannered, middle-aged man (who, unknown to him, is actually a confederate of the experimenter). The experimenter announces his interest in the effects of punishment on learning. He draws slips of paper from a hat to determine who will be the “teacher” and who the “… ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1387))

- The teacher then watches as the learner is strapped into an electric-chair apparatus (to “prevent excessive movement,” the experimenter explains). An electrode is taped to the man’s wrist and electrode paste is applied to the skin (to “prevent burns”). The experimenter explains that the electrode is attached to a shock generator, and that the teacher’s specific task will be to administer shocks to the learner (by pushing switches on the shock generator) every time the learner makes a mistake in recalling a word. The teacher is then led into an adjacent room, out of sight of the learner, and seated in front of the shock generator. On the generator, the teacher sees 30 lever switches, labeled in 15-volt increments from 15 to 450 volts, with accompanying descriptions of the intensities of shock, ranging from “slight shock” to “danger: severe… ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1395))

- that “although the shocks can be extremely painful, they cause no permanent tissue damage.” The experimenter remains by the teacher’s side, where he stays throughout the experiment that follows. As the scenario unfolds, the learner indicates his answers by choosing from a list of four words and pressing a button that lights up one of four signals at the top of the teacher’s shock generator. After the learner’s first mistake, the teacher increases the shock – 15 volts, then another 15, and so on. The teacher’s dilemma is heightened by the “feedback” he receives from the hapless learner. Initially, there are only verbal protests about the painfulness of the shocks, but the learner continues to participate. Then, when the shock level reaches 300 volts, the learner pounds on the wall in protest, and from… ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1403))

- Throughout the procedure the experimenter restates the teacher’s duties. If the teacher looks to the experimenter for guidance, the experimenter says, “Please continue.” If the teacher protests that the learner is no longer giving answers, the experimenter states that the failure to answer should be considered a wrong answer. If the teacher expresses a reluctance to continue or suggests that the learner’s condition should be examined, the experimenter merely insists that “the experiment requires that you continue.” If the teacher becomes really insistent, the experimenter announces, “you have no choice; you must go on.” And if (but only if) the subject protests that he will not accept responsibility for harm that might be done to the learner, the experimenter assures him that “the responsibility is mine.” As… ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1411))

Most people (68 percent in the best-known variation) obeyed to the bitter end, beyond the “danger: severe shock” level, all the way to the final “450-volt, XXX” level. This result confounded Milgram’s own expectations and those of everyone else. Laypeople, social psychologists, and psychiatrists whom Milgram consulted all assured him that virtually no one would reach the highest levels of shock. The question that arose then, and that remains today, is why so many people obeyed so completely (or, alternatively, why so few people predicted the correct result). Even today we cannot read the results of Milgram’s experiment without feeling that we have learned something very dire about our society in particular and the human… ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1418))

Some people react to Milgram’s results with the reassuring conclusion that the subjects must have seen through the hoax and realized that the victim was not really being shocked. After all, “anyone” would know a respected institution like Yale would “never allow such a thing to happen.” Milgram anticipated such objections, and he was determined that his results not be so easily dismissed. Accordingly, he replicated his study using a shabby office in a rundown section of Bridgeport, Connecticut – this time under the uninspiring aegis of an unknown “Research Institute.” The dropoff in obedience proved to be relatively slight.

At one point he pushed his fist into his forehead and muttered: “Oh God, let’s stop it.” And yet he continued to respond to every word of the experimenter, and obeyed to the end. (Milgram, 1963, p. 377) Such reports not only allow us to dismiss the possibility that Milgram’s subjects were merely going along with the experimenter’s charade, they also allow us to discredit the potential explanation that people in this age of urban anonymity don’t care what they do to strangers.

- The answer appears to be that it was certain subtle features of Milgram’s situation – whose influence tends to be unrecognized or underappreciated by all who read about or even personally witnessed that situation – that prompted ordinary members of our society to behave so extraordinarily. We cannot claim to have identified all these features, or to understand exactly how and why they interacted to produce so potent an effect, but we can outline a few of them which, not coincidentally, turn out to be some of the same situational influences and channel factors that we have discussed for other studies. Milgram’s own analysis began with the subject’s implicit contract to do as one is told without asking why, faithfully serving the authority figure to whom one has willingly ceded responsibility. His analysis also stresses the gradual, stepwise character of the shift from relatively unobjectionable behavior to complicity in a pointless, cruel, and dangerous ordeal. The teacher, it must be remembered, did not obey a single, simple command to deliver a powerful shock to an innocent victim. At first, all he undertook to do was to deliver mild punishments – feedback really – to a learner who had willingly agreed to receive such feedback as an aid in performing his task. He also agreed, as did the learner, to a specific punishment procedure (that is, increasing the punishments by a fixed amount after each error), without ever imagining the full consequences of that agreement. It was only as the stepwise progression continued, and the shocks being administered reached alarming levels, that the teacher’s psychological dilemma became apparent.

There are also some additional, less obvious, features of the Milgram demonstration that we must recognize if we are to appreciate the subjects’ view of their situation and their own behavior. In particular, it is important to note that relatively few of Milgram’s subjects simply obeyed from beginning to end without ever questioning their orders or expressing any unwillingness to continue. While Milgram’s research reports were not as precise as they should have been on this crucial issue, it is apparent that most participants did step outside the role of “obedient subject” to question the… ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1456))

Most of the subjects did confront the experimenter and even refused to continue, often quite forcefully. But nearly always they were backed down by the experimenter. (“The experiment requires that you continue.” “You have no choice.”) Indeed, the Milgram experiments ultimately may have less to say about “destructive obedience” than about ineffectual, and indecisive, disobedience. A thought experiment will be helpful here.

In Lewinian terms, there was no well-defined, legitimate, channel that the teacher could use to escape from the situation and discontinue participation in the experiment; and any attempt to create such a channel was met with implacable opposition from an experimenter who, significantly, never even acknowledged the legitimacy of the teacher’s concerns. There is yet one more, still subtler and more elusive feature of the Milgram situation that may have been very important from the subject’s viewpoint. The events that unfolded did not “make sense” or “add up” from the perspective of the subject. The subject’s task was that of administering severe electric shocks to a learner who was no longer attempting to learn anything… ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1472))

Unless subjects grasped both the nature of the deception and the real purpose of the experiment (in which case, presumably, they would have chosen to disobey in order to prove that they were not the sort to carry out evil orders in stolid, Eichmann-like fashion), there was simply no way for them to arrive at a stable “definition of the situation.” And how does one respond when “nothing seems to make sense,” when one’s own understanding of the actions and outcomes unfolding around one obviously is limited or deficient?

(We’ve never found such slavish obedience forthcoming from the students or advisees whom we enjoin to keep up to date with their reading, take neat lecture notes, and to study for exams in an orderly and timely fashion – and it is not because they do not regard us as authority figures.)

- penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors” (1930, p. 82). The claim, of course, was not that “person” variables didn’t matter in the determination of behavior; rather, it was that the “person” is simply the sum of the situational contingencies experienced in the past – contingencies that could be described objectively, and that provide a basis for precise behavioral prediction and control. But the situationism of the behaviorists was bound up with their insistence that the inner workings of the human mind could not be the proper subject matter of a scientific psychology. They insisted on abandoning the nineteenth-century research strategy of having people introspect about subjective mental experiences. Instead, the new science of psychology was to concern itself exclusively with observable, quantifiable events – in particular, overt responses, observable environmental stimuli that provoked such responses, and objectively specifiable outcomes (for example, specific “reinforcements” relevant to well-defined biological drives) that were the consequences of such responses. All behavior, however subtle or complicated, was to be understood in terms of associations among stimuli, responses, and hedonic consequences, and in terms of generalizations made from one stimulus or context to another on the basis of similarity. The behaviorists paved the way for many important theoretical and applied contributions in the exploration of classical and instrumental conditioning and, more generally, in the study of learning and motivation. But in the strategic decision to ignore subjective experience and concentrate only on… ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1501))

- episode will influence Jane’s and Bob’s subsequent responses to each other, to sorority mixers, and to other related social settings. Indeed, to understand fully the nature and implications of such social dramas, we need to bear in mind that people are not only trying to interpret each other’s words and deeds, they are also trying to predict, monitor, and gently guide each other’s interpretations. The point of the sorority mixer vignette is a very general one. Whether we are disinterested scientific observers of such episodes or participants in them, we must attend closely to questions of subjective meaning. First, we must try to discern how the participants categorize the situation so that their past experience and current beliefs about the world can be brought to bear. Second, we must know what the participants believe about the contingencies between their actions and subsequent outcomes, that is, what likelihoods they attach to particular consequences and what they assume about the cause-effect relationships governing those likelihoods. In short, we must be aware that objective accounts of stimuli, responses, and reinforcements, and objective specification of the linkages among them, will rarely be sufficient for our purposes. We need to know how the participants themselves perceive these “objective” events, and what they believe about the relevant linkages among them. It is no accident that Clark Hull, B. F. Skinner, and other learning theorists in the behaviorist tradition who exerted so much influence in the first half of this century found ways to effectively “finesse” such problems of subjective construal. First, in studying response acquisition and change, they relied primarily on rats and pigeons, organisms that we assume to be less disposed than humans to ponder the meaning of their environment. (And, in any case, whatever private ruminations these organisms might have about their private interpretations, expectations, or motives, they cannot tell us about them.)

- In less sterile circumstances, where the stimuli presented are more complex, where behavioral options are less obviously tied to the satisfaction of innate drives, and where organisms are likely to hold theories based on their experiences with real-world contingencies, accurate behavioral prediction and control proved a more elusive goal. This was true even for pigeons, rats, and cats, as Martin Seligman (1970) pointed out in a revolutionary article near the end of the behaviorist hegemony in psychology.

- substantial prior meaning for the organism, they found that the “laws of learning” they had established with meaningless stimuli and primary reinforcers did not hold. Instead of smooth, gradual learning curves, investigators tended to find abrupt, even “one-trial” learning or sometimes, no learning at all. For example, cats can be taught to pull a string to get food, but they cannot be taught to lick their coats to get food, despite the fact that the latter response has a far higher “operant” or basal level of occurrence. Similarly, pigeons will die sooner than learn to not peck at a screen in order to get food. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1559))

- More generally, people are highly subject to “framing” effects. They judge costs and benefits of various actions, and experience various degrees of regret about choices, not with respect to final outcomes but with respect to comparisons that are implicit or explicit in the presentation of the problem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Thus people tend to choose one action if they judge it in relation to a given arbitrary starting point of wealth and to choose another action if they are maneuvered into thinking about a different starting point of wealth. Recently, Kahneman and Miller (1986) have extended this point to apply to all of cognition. They argue that every stimulus recruits comparison stimuli from memory against which it is judged. For example, the vegetable soup you taste now is compared with the vegetable soup you had last week, the minestrone you had last month, the canned vegetable soup you had as a child, and so on. All these together constitute the “norm” in terms of which the present stimulus is judged. To a behaviorist, such a view stops little short of nihilism. Since each individual has a different history, different memories will be constructed for the reference frame. Nothing could be further from the behaviorists’ dream of identifying stimulus properties objectively, without reference to the black box inside the subject’s head. The relativist view in psychology has been shown to have objective behavioral and motivational consequences of just the sort the behaviorist is honor-bound to respect. For example, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) have shown, in their prospect theory treatment of choice, that there is an asymmetry between loss and gain situations such that people are more motivated to avoid a loss of a given size than to gain an equivalent amount. Such a principle helps us understand why it is that people are often goaded into action less by the prospect of gain than by the prospect of loss. Thus American labor unions boast with justification about their past successes in winning better working conditions, higher wages, and shorter work weeks for their members; but labor historians tell us that union growth and union militancy in this… ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1582))

- One of the most interesting motivational implications of the relativity of judgment is that both happiness and unhappiness should be selflimiting to a degree. This is the strong suggestion of work by Brickman et al. (1978), who studied people whose life circumstances were drastically changed by good fortune or tragedy. He discovered that lottery winners were at first overjoyed at their new estate; but after a year or two they proved to be no more satisfied with their lot than the rest of us. People who became paralyzed through injury, or who struggled with life-threatening diseases similarly seemed to adapt to their circumstances. At first miserable or even suicidal, they eventually became about as happy as the average person. ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1607))

- Just as judgments about stimuli were shown to be inherently relativistic and subjective, other work showed that subjective construals of the relationship between response and reinforcer are also inherently a matter of interpretation. Such interpretations have significant implications for subsequent motives and behavior. The dissonance theorists, led by Leon Festinger, took particular delight in tweaking the noses of the behaviorists. They did this by showing repeatedly that they could invert the effects of reward on behavior by manipulating the meaning the subject placed on the relation between the reward and the behavior that elicited it. One classic dissonance paradigm (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959), for instance, paid subjects for telling a fellow student that a particularly tedious and mindless experimental task they had just completed (rotating pegs on a pegboard) was actually quite interesting. The subjects did so, at the request of the experimenter, in preparing the student to be the next participant to undertake the boring task. The finding was that subjects were more likely to “internalize” the message – that is, to decide that the task ([Location 1632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1632))

- really had been interesting – when the payment in question was $1.00 than when it was $20.00 (which, in 1959, would have constituted a fair wage for a whole day of semiskilled labor). From the viewpoint of dissonance theory, with its emphasis on cognitive balance and rationalization, it was not difficult to explain this result. Subjects receiving a mere $1.00 payment, it was argued, felt dissonance about agreeing to deceive their peers and about saying something publicly that was discrepant from their actual views. Accordingly, they reduced their dissonance in the one way left open to them, that is, by deciding that they really had found the task at least somewhat interesting. By contrast, subjects receiving a $20.00 payment needed no such mental gymnastics to handle the discrepancy between their private beliefs and their public behavior. The $20.00 payment provided a psychologically adequate justification for their lie. Consequently, they felt little residual dissonance, and had no need to adjust their subjective evaluation of the boring task. The larger point of the Festinger and Carlsmith study has now been demonstrated literally hundreds of times, and the underlying motivational basis also has been demonstrated clearly (Cooper, Zanna, & Taves, 1978; Steele, 1988).

- because they take on different coloration from the ideas by which they are surrounded and with which they are compared: “. . . no state once gone can recur and be identical with what it was before” (1890/1948, p. 154, italics in original). Consequently, “no two ‘ideas’ are ever exactly the same . . .” (p. 157). Lawrence Barsalou (1987) has given this idea a modem interpretation and presented some interesting data in support of it. Barsalou argues that, “Rather than being retrieved as static units from memory to represent categories, concepts originate in a highly flexible process that retrieves generic and episodic information from long-term memory to construct temporary concepts in working memory” (p. 101). The common-sense assumption would be that a given individual’s notion of such basic categories as “bird,” “fruit,” “vehicles,” and “things to pack in a suitcase” would be a constant. But Barsalou has shown that there is a nontrivial degree of instability even in such familiar, often-used categories. Thus when he had subjects rate twice within a single month several exemplars of such categories, for example, “robin,” “pigeon,” “parrot,” as to how typical they were of the concept, the subjects gave typicality ratings on the two different occasions that correlated with each other in the vicinity of .80. A correlation of .80 is, of ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1677))

- course, a very high one; nevertheless, it falls substantially short of perfect predictability of the meaning of a category on one occasion from knowledge of its meaning on another. Moreover, the interpretation of any given complex situation requires the application of many categories, some of which are less clear-cut in their meaning than the simple ones examined by Barsalou. The likelihood that two literally identical situations will be judged the same on two different occasions therefore plummets rather rapidly as a function of complexity. Barsalou also found that the correlation between any two subjects, all of whom were college students at the same university, averaged around .45. Thus agreement on typicality of exemplars, even for very common categories, is only modest. These two findings are very important to arguments that we will return to repeatedly in this chapter and in this book. First, there is significant variability in a given person’s construal of events, enough to lead us, just on the grounds of interpretive… ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1687))

- person to another in the meaning even of rather fundamental concepts. Hence, any two people are likely to interpret the same situation in somewhat different ways. We will argue that a great many important phenomena derive from the variability of construal within a person and from the differences in construal between people on any given occasion. Further phenomena of importance derive from people’s relative ignorance of these two facts. We do not recognize the inherent variability in our own construal of events; hence we predict our own behavior with too great confidence. We similarly fail to recognize both the random (or at least unpredictable) differences between our own and others’ construals of events and the systematic, stable differences. Consequently, we predict other people’s behavior too confidently and, when confronted with surprising behavior on the part of another person, attribute it to extreme personality traits or to motivational differences between ourselves and the other person, rather than recognizing that the other… ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1696))

Kurt Lewin (1935) consistently emphasized that the individual’s “life space” must be characterized in a way that captures its (contemporary) subjective reality and personal significance. The Gestalt psychologists (for example, Koffka, 1935) gave similar emphasis to the subjective dimension, as did Brunswik’s (1956) theories of social perception. Most notably of all, perhaps, the advice to focus on the patient’s own subjective representation of events had been echoed by successive generations of clinicians – from Freud’s (1901/1960) analysis of biases in perceptions and memory to Kelly’s (1955) seminal discussion of “personal constructs.” But the discussions of the construal problem that most… ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1705))

- One phenomenon involved the seemingly disproportionate impact of certain “central” evaluation dimensions such as warmth versus coldness. Asch argued that the stimulus traits on his list (like virtually all isolated bits of information one possesses about a person) were susceptible to variable interpretation – and that the specific meaning or construal attached to particular items of information depended upon the more global impressions adopted by the subjects. Thus a seemingly straightforward descriptive term like “intelligent” would have very different connotations when construed in light of a positive global impression of warmth than when the same term was construed in light of a negative impression of coldness. In the former case, “intelligent” means something like “sensible, wise, insightful, and stimulating”; in the latter case, its connotation is closer to “cunning and scheming,” or perhaps, “detached intellectual brilliance of a haughty, cynical, and inhuman variety.” ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1738))

- This means that our construals of events are at the mercy of the often arbitrary sequence in which we encounter them. Having heard first about Joe’s exemplary work for local charities and only later about his rather messy divorce, we like him and are rather sympathetic to his personal problems. Having heard first about the divorce and only later about the charitable work, we think he’s a brute cynically trying to improve his image on the backs of the community’s more unfortunate members. Thus, in contrast to critics who insisted that initial information has greater impact than later information because it receives more attention or is weighted more heavily (N. H.

- Construal and communicator credibility. Asch also applied his controversial change of meaning hypothesis in helping to illuminate the seemingly straightforward finding that arguments produce more attitude change in the people who read them when they are attributed to well-regarded (that is, attractive, trustworthy, or expert) communication sources than when they are attributed to poorly regarded sources. Conventional learning theory interpretations of this effect hinged on the fact that messages associated with attractive and highly credible sources would be attended to more closely, recalled more successfully, regarded as more accurate and reliable, and deemed more worthy of adoption by the recipient, than the same messages associated with unattractive, noncredible sources (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953). Asch, however, again offered a less conventional, and more “dynamic,” hypothesis. As in the case of social conformity, he argued that the information about sources conveyed by the experimenter induces a change not in the “judgment of the object” but rather in “the object of judgment.” The very meaning of the message, Asch (1948, 1952) insisted, changes as a function of the source to which it ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1756))

- is attributed. Thus, to cite Asch’s classic example, an assertion to the effect that “a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing” is much more widely endorsed when attributed to Jefferson than to Lenin, because it has a different meaning in the former case than in the latter. When the statement comes from Thomas Jefferson, it conjures up images of honest farmers and tradespeople throwing off the yoke of corrupt and indifferent rulers. When it comes from Lenin, the images (at least to Americans) are quite different – a revolutionary reign of terror in which mobs run amok and harsh new authoritarians take the place of the old oppressors. Given these differences in construal, it is hardly surprising that the rebellion championed by Jefferson is endorsed more enthusiastically than the one championed by Lenin.

- Asch’s studies convinced most social psychologists that construals can readily be manipulated, and that such manipulations can have profound effects on people’s judgments.

Lord, Lepper, and Ross (1979; see also Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Ross & Lepper, 1980) showed that two opposing partisan groups respond to the same body of mixed and inconclusive evidence by increasing the strength and polarization of their respective beliefs. This polarization effect, it seemed, occurred because the subjects in both partisan groups tended to accept evidence supportive of their own position uncritically, while at the same time critically scrutinizing and “explaining away” evidence that was equally probative but that ran counter to their ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1779))

- position. Thus, both proponents and opponents of capital punishment who were asked to read a mixed package of evidence about the deterrent value of the death penalty came away with their views strengthened. Both sides took comfort from the evidence in support of their position, and both sides had no trouble seeing the flaws in evidence for the opposing view. Building on these results, Vallone, Ross, and Lepper (1985) reasoned that the same biases in assimilation of evidence should influence the reactions the partisan groups have to third parties who offer evaluations, or even summary reports, of any evidence relevant to the dispute. Specifically, the partisans should perceive even maximally objective or evenhanded evaluations – and those who offer them – as unfairly biased and hostile.

- The term “schema” (Bartlett, 1932; Piaget, 1930) was the earliest, and remains the most popular, term used to describe such dynamic knowledge structures. For example, the child learns a “conservation schema,” or set of rules, that tell the child what to expect about changes in quantity of material as its shape changes. More recently, the provocative term “script” (Abelson, 1981; Schank & Abelson, 1977) has come into use to capture our understanding of the ways in which people in many familiar settings play well-defined roles and choose from among specified behavioral options (for example, the restaurant script, the birthday party script, the university lecture script, and so on). The notion underlying the script concept is that predictable, even ritualistic, interactions occur between people who are attempting to satisfy their needs with as little social stress and cognitive strain as possible. The details of different types of knowledge structures need not concern us here, only the sorts of work they accomplish. It is now well documented by researchers that by employing preexisting schemas and other knowledge structures, the social perceiver is permitted to make inferences and judgments with heightened ease, speed, and subjective confidence. To the extent that we employ knowledge structures that are generally accurate in their generic representation, and to the extent that we refrain from employing them too quickly, broadly, or “mindlessly” (Langer, 1989), the consequences of schematic processing are entirely salutary.

- One particular type of subjective construal became a central concern of both theoretical and applied social psychology in the 1970s. This is the causal attribution process that people engage in as they attempt to understand the relation between social situations and behavior, and the relation between behavior and outcomes. There is a set of related attribution tasks, including inferences about the relative importance of various causal factors, inferences about the personal characteristics and capacities of the people we observe (including ourselves), and predictions, based on these attributions, about the likelihood of various future actions and outcomes. Such subjective interpretations, it is clear from research, have extremely important consequences in terms of objective behavior. Whether one’s concern is a laboratory rat’s “decision” about the wisdom of continuing to press a lever in the absence of continuing reinforcement, a college sophomore’s decision about whether to take an advanced chemistry course after earning an A in the introductory course, or an employer’s decision about whether to offer encouragement or criticism to a salesperson whose sales have fallen off in recent months, it is the decision-maker’s perceptions about the causes of relevant past events that will determine the decision.

- In 1967, Harold Kelley, building on the work of many investigators, including Heider (1958), de Charms (1968), and Jones and Davis (1965), brought the topic of attribution to the center stage of social psychology, where it has been ever since. Kelley’s approach was novel in that it was both normative and descriptive. He proposed a set of principles or decision criteria that would promote accurate attributions, and he further suggested that people generally ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1896))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- are guided by these principles. These normative and descriptive principles, not coincidentally, were closely analogous to the principles of statistical analysis commonly employed by scientists and statisticians when they perform an “analysis of variance.” Thus Kelley suggested that in trying to understand why a person acted in a particular way, one calls on one’s knowledge of or guesses about the way the person has acted in other similar situations (distinctiveness data), the way the person has acted in the same situation in the past (consistency data), and the way other people have acted in the same situation (consensus data). Cause is then attributed to the factors with which the effect seems to “covary.” For example, in trying to decide why John liked the new thriller playing at the Bijoux (that is, deciding whether this film is really… ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1899))

- whether it is John or this particular film that is most strongly associated with positive reviews. If John raves about all films, or at least all “thrillers,” or if other filmgoers have been unenthusiastic about this particular film, we are disinclined to think that John’s rave tells us very much about the film’s quality. If, on the other hand, John rarely offers raves (especially to thrillers playing at the likes of the Bijoux), or if other filmgoers share John’s enthusiasm for this particular film, we start making plans to go to the Bijoux next Saturday. Kelley (1972) proposed a second attribution principle to supplement this covariation rule, one that could be employed in the case where one possesses no information about the actor’s response to other related stimuli or about the responses of other actors to this particular stimulus. This principle involves discounting any particular cause or explanation to the extent that one can discern the presence and possible influence of other potential causes. Thus, if John tells us that he loved the film at the Bijoux, we discount the quality of the film as a potential cause of his praise to the extent that we can think of other plausible reasons for his response (for example, the fact that he gets a commission on every ticket sold, or the suspicion that he wants us to go to the Bijoux next Saturday so he can get a ride home from his job at the fast-food restaurant next door). Not surprisingly, researchers (for example, McArthur, 1972; Orvis, Cunningham, & Kelley, 1975) have been able to show that people can and often do use information about covarying causes and effects and about competing causal candidates in… ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1906))

Their contention was that people’s subjective emotional experiences – that is, the way they label their feelings and the way they respond to triggering stimuli – may not depend strictly on the nature of their internal physiological state. Such sensations, Schachter and Singer argued, tend to be too diffuse and nonspecific to give rise to our diverse emotional experiences. Instead, emotional experience and emotional behavior depend on the inferences we make about the causes of our arousal. If the most plausible source of our arousal is a slapstick movie we are watching, we feel amused or happy and we laugh.

While many contemporary theorists would challenge Schachter and Singer’s ideas about the lack of physiological specificity in emotional experience, few now would deny that we can be led to mislabel our feelings and to reach erroneous conclusions about the source of such feelings. There is also considerable evidence that people who are undergoing an emotion-provoking experience may feel and act less emotional if they are led to attribute… ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=1936))

Why are the results of dissonance and arousal attribution studies so surprising? A little thought reveals that it is because one does not typically observe oneself engaging in the cognitive processes postulated to underlie the effects in question. That is, one does not observe oneself changing one’s attitudes to bring them into line with behavior.

- How general is such unconscious, high-level processing of information? Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that it is very prevalent indeed. In fact, they argued that there is no direct access to cognitive processes at all; instead, there is access only to the ideas and inferences that are the outputs resulting from such processes. Some processes, such as the algorithms for solving well-formed problems, have verbal concomitants that may accompany and track the processes, and thus we may be quite accurate about the way we reached a judgment or conclusion. (For example, “I recognized that this must be a conservation of energy problem and applied the appropriate formula.”) But for many problems, especially novel ones involving social judgment, there is very little conscious representation of underlying cognitive processes. Thus, for example, when subjects were asked to rate applicants for a job, they were no more accurate in reporting on the factors that affected their appraisal than they were in reporting on the factors that affected someone else’s appraisal. Jack’s reports about what influenced his judgment were no more accurate for his judgments than they were for Pete’s. Similarly, college women were no more accurate in reporting the factors that caused day-to-day shifts in their own mood than they were in predicting what factors affected another woman’s mood (Weiss & Brown, 1977). Indeed, they showed no net accuracy at all in their causal reports either for themselves or for others. People have theories about what effects their judgments and behavior just as they have theories about all kinds of social processes.

What feels like direct perception of the stimulus is often highly mediated by construal processes that lie outside the purview of consciousness. It therefore feels like we “call ’em as they are,” rather than “as we see ’em.” This lack of awareness of our own construal processes blinds us to the possibility that someone else, differently situated, might construe the same objects in a different way. When we find that someone else has appraised the stimulus differently from the way we have appraised it, we leap to conclusions about unusual dispositions or strong motives on the part of the other person.

In the remainder of this chapter we will illustrate how this failing has been at the heart of inferential and attributional shortcomings that have preoccupied social psychologists and cognitive psychologists over the past two decades. Once again we will take the liberty of focusing on phenomena that we have dealt with in our own research (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Ross, 1990). The False Consensus Effect In a study of attributional shortcomings, Ross, Greene, and House (1977) asked subjects to read descriptions of a series of hypothetical situations, each of which posed a choice between two response alternatives.

One scenario, for instance, described the following dilemma: As you are leaving your neighborhood supermarket, a man in a business suit asks whether you like shopping in that store. You reply quite honestly that you do like shopping there and indicate that in addition to being close to your home, the supermarket seems to have very good meats and produce at reasonably low prices. The man then reveals that a videotape crew has filmed your comments and asks you to sign a release allowing them to use the unedited film for a TV commercial the supermarket chain is preparing. Would you agree or refuse to sign the release?

People who thought they would not sign assumed that refusal would be the majority response and that the minority who agreed would be unusually gullible or exhibitionistic. This phenomenon is similar to one that has been called “egocentric attribution.” Reports of findings resembling this false consensus effect had appeared sporadically in the social perception and attribution literatures (Holmes, 1968; Katz & Allport, 1931; Kelley & Stahelski, 1970). Generally, the interpretations offered for such phenomena had been motivational, centering on peoples’ need to feel that their behavioral choices are rational and normative.

Consider, for example, what is not specified in the brief description of the hypothetical supermarket encounter: What exactly did the “man in a business suit” look like, and how exactly did he make his request? (Was he a fast-talking huckster wearing a pinky ring, or a pleasant, clean-cut chap whom one would hate to disappoint?) How were you dressed at the time? (Were you in sweaty jogging togs, or in a snappy new outfit?) And what, exactly, did you say, and how did you say it? (Were you fluent and witty, or inarticulate and a little silly?) Beyond these details of content and context, there are questions of prior experience. (… ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2018))

(Did you experience fears about “being exploited,” adhere to norms about helping out someone who is “just doing his job,” feel joy or dread at the notoriety of “being seen on television?”) Obviously, some readers of the scenario would fill in more of these unspecified contextual details than others. But the way in which you happen to resolve such ambiguities would influence not only the hypothetical response you specified for yourself, but also your estimates of consensus and your assessment of the “meaning” of the two possible responses. The fact that ambiguities exist in written or oral accounts, and the likelihood that they will be resolved differently by different individuals, is rich in its implications – especially in a world where so much of the knowledge we have about each other’s actions does, indeed, come secondhand. But the issue of semantic ambiguity raises a question about the generality of the false consensus effect. That is, does it occur only for hypothetical secondhand descriptions and reports, or does it also occur in our evaluations of real actions that we personally experience? To answer this question, the investigators conducted a study that forced subjects to face a real dilemma, make a real choice, and then offer consensus estimates and personal attributions about individuals who purportedly had responded to the same dilemma.

This “real” dilemma confirmed the findings of the questionnaire studies. Overall, subjects who agreed to wear the sandwich-board sign estimated that 62% of their peers would make the same choice. Subjects who refused to wear the sign estimated that only 33% of their peers would comply with the experimenter’s request. “Compliant” and “noncompliant” subjects also disagreed about the relative diagnosticity of agreement versus refusal to wear the sandwich board on the part of two specific peers.

- The sandwich-board study shows that the false consensus effect does not pertain only to estimates about hypothetical responses to vaguely described scenarios. Real situations, like hypothetical events, generally can be construed in variable ways. Thus subjects who imagined that their sandwich-board adventure would prompt ridicule from their peers, or who anticipated that the experimenter would accept their refusal to participate with equanimity, or who construed the overall situation as a test of their conformity tendencies, likely would refuse to wear the sign. They also would tend to assume that people who acquiesce under such circumstances would have to possess unusual or extreme personality traits. By contrast, subjects who imagined that their peers would applaud their good sportsmanship, or who imagined that their… ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2048))

An interpretation of the false consensus effect in terms of construal, it should be reemphasized, requires more than the simple assumption that different people construe a given situation in different ways. It depends on the additional assumption that in doing so they fail to recognize or fail to make adequate inferential allowance for the fact that their peers may construe the “same” situation quite differently. The contention here is that people fail to recognize the… ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2055))

- Even more significant, perhaps, was the fact that in the predictions people made about their own academic choices, social preferences, and recreational activities, they showed the same type of overconfidence (Vallone, Griffin, Lin, & Ross, 1990). In other words, not only when subjects made predictions about the responses of people they knew well (that is, roommates) but even when they made predictions about the responses of the people whom they knew best (that is, themselves), subjects overestimated the certainty of the outcomes they were predicting. Overconfidence proved to be most dramatic, furthermore, in the case of predictions in which subjects knowingly or unknowingly went against the relevant response base rates – that is, when they predicted that a particular actor, or even they themselves, would respond in a way that differed from the most frequent behavior of their peers (and, presumably, from the dictates of whatever situational pressures and constraints govern the behavior of people in general).

- There are two different aspects to the construal problem that produce overconfidence in social prediction. First, to predict a person’s response to a given situation – even a person whom one knows very well and has been able to observe in a wide variety of previous situations – one usually must know or correctly infer the details of that situation, in particular, those features of the context that help determine the relative attractiveness of the available response alternatives. Second, beyond knowing such objective features of the situation, one must discern the meaning of the situation from the private perspective of the actor. Uncertainty either about objective features of the situation or about their subjective construal by the actor increases the difficulty of prediction and the ([Location 2085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2085))

- at her two-year-old in the supermarket” or that “John donated blood last Thursday” – without telling us about relevant situational factors and contextual details. We may even personally witness the relevant behavior but be left to imagine or construe features that may have been critical in their influence – for example, what Jane’s two-yearold might have done in the preceding hour and how the child may have responded to milder rebukes in the past, or whether John’s office might have set itself a blood donation quota to which everyone but John had already contributed. In such cases we are usually too ready to assume a person has traits corresponding directly to the type of behavior that was exhibited, without reconsidering one’s construal of the situation facing that person in light of the response. The implications of such naive dispositionism are perhaps clearest in cases where one learns that a person of presumably ordinary character has behaved in a way that seems exceptional – exceptional, at least, given our current construal of the situation. In such cases, we contend, observers are overly disposed to “recompute” the person, that is, to abandon the assumption that the person is probably quite average and begin searching for dispositions that would explain the behavior in question. What observers are insufficiently disposed to do, we argue, is to recompute the nature of the situation – that is, to consider ways in which the situation (either the objective situation or the person’s subjective construal of it) might have been different from what we had assumed, different especially in ways that would make the relevant behavior less surprising and less reflective of extreme personal dispositions. An experience of one of the authors drives this point home. A colleague who perennially taught an upper-level undergraduate methods class was reputed to give very high grades in the course as a routine matter. Upon finding out about this, the author began looking for an explanation in the colleague’s personality. A need to pander to student opinion, perhaps?

It is important for the sake of the illustration to note that the author had no good prior reason to assume that this colleague, rather than any other colleague, possessed such traits. A short time later, the author himself taught the course. He found the students to be an unrepresentatively talented bunch who threw themselves into original and ambitious laboratory projects with energy and zeal. In appropriate response to this situation, he, too, gave very high grades! Thus lay dispositionism is reflected in the failure simply to withhold judgment about the individual – that is, to assume that one’s prior construal of the situation was probably inaccurate in some nontrivial way, and to assume further that a more accurate construal would make the actor’s behavior seem less exceptional and, hence, less… ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2113))

A related thesis involves the layperson’s failure to recognize the importance of subjective interpretation, that is, to realize the extent to which behavior can be predicted and understood only in light of the actor’s own construal of the situation providing the context for such behavior. If people slight the importance of objective situational factors and subjective construals, to what do they attribute the behavior they observe? And on what do they base their predictions about future behavior? The answer we get both from research evidence and from everyday experience is that people are inveterate dispositionists. They account for past actions and outcomes, and make predictions about future actions and outcomes, in terms of the person – or more specifically, in terms of presumed personality traits or other distinctive and enduring personal dispositions.

What our review highlights, however, is their apparent lack of power – at least when evaluated in the harsh light of standard correlation coefficients determined in well-controlled research settings. These statistical results, it is important to note, were quite surprising both to the investigators who did the research and to the field of psychology as a whole, just as they are likely to be surprising to most students who learn about them in the classroom. Indeed, in their own way, the results in question have proven to be just as challenging to intuition, just as inviting of skepticism, and ultimately just as provocative in their implications as the results of the classic studies we have cited to demonstrate the power of the situation. What is the source of this widespread surprise and skepticism? We suspect that these reactions can be traced to the fact that professional psychologists draw heavily on essentially the same intuitive theories and reflect upon essentially the same types of everyday social experiences as do laypeople. And the theories are wrong and the experiences are misleading in some very important respects. ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2141))

The second assumption, equally congruent with everyday social experience, is that individuals display a substantial degree of consistency, and hence a substantial degree of predictability, in responding to different situations. Putting these two assumptions together gives us the core proposition of lay dispositionism – that is, that the variability in responses we witness when different people react to a given situation is a reflection not of randomness or indeterminacy but of the distinctive and enduring personal attributes that the various actors bring to that situation.

Other broad factors that emerge from some studies include dominance-submissiveness, conscientiousness-unconscientiousness, and cultured-boorish (for example, Digman & Inouye, 1986; Norman, 1963).

Mischel’s (1968) personality assessment text in particular seemed to shake the field of personality to its very foundations. The aftershocks continue today, despite the fact that Mischel’s initial contribution was simply to summarize some facts that were well known to most researchers. Perhaps the most important of these facts was that the average correlation between different behavioral measures specifically designed to tap the same personality trait (for example, impulsivity, honesty, dependency, or the like) was typically in the range between .10 and .20, and often was even lower. This means, in terms of the percentage comparisons we have used to convey magnitude of effect, that there is almost no gain in accuracy of prediction about situation 2 by virtue of knowing how someone has behaved in situation 1. If the correlation is, say, .16 between friendliness in any two situations, this means that knowing that Jane was friendlier than Ellen in situation ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2233))

Correlations between scores on personality scales designed to measure a given trait and behavior in any particular situation presumed to tap that trait, moreover, rarely exceeded the .20 to .30 range. Virtually no coefficients, either between individual pairs of behavioral measures or between personality scale scores and individual behavioral measures, exceeded the .30 “barrier.” Mischel’s response to the perplexingly low correlations found between objective behavioral measures was quite novel. Unlike previous commentators, he did not try to explain away the low correlations by suggesting flaws in methodology.

The second challenge was to find new ways of understanding the determinants of people’s response to their social environment.

Simply stated, no amount of reliability in the assessments of a single rater (nor even agreement between different raters) proves that the consistency lies in the behavior of the person being rated. A rater can persist in beliefs or stereotypes that are unsubstantiated by objective response data or that are substantiated only by interpreting such data in the light of one’s presuppositions. You may have decided that you are shy, sensitive, and conscientious, but who is to say that you’re right? Similarly, two different raters, or a rater and an individual being rated, can agree on objectively unfounded personality assessments – provided that their assessments are guided by a shared set of implicit personality theories, stereotypes, or local reputations (for example, “people who wear glasses are brainy,” or “short men are aggressive,” or “all the Van Ormands are stuck-up”). Nevertheless, the ease of paper-and-pencil measures, and the often respectable correlations they yielded, left researchers with little inclination to return to the painstaking but unrewarding search for objective behavioral consistency.

- It was only five years after the Sears study that Mischel and Peterson launched their challenging assault on conventional assumptions about personal consistency. Essentially, what these theorists did was to clear away the accumulated underbrush of studies that had relied exclusively on agreement of subjective assessments and to refocus attention on the few studies that had employed objective behavioral measures. In giving priority to these objective measures, Mischel and Peterson noted the obvious objections to the use of reliabilities in subjective assessment as a means of demonstrating the existence (much less establishing the magnitude) of enduring individual differences in personality. They insisted that while agreement of measures and stability over time are interesting phenomena that are worthy of investigation, they do not establish the validity of the trait constructs in question. They also summarized the existing literature on information-processing biases and the other shortcomings of human inference that could compromise the validity of social perceptions and even self-perceptions – in particular, reliance upon stereotypes based on appearance, role, or reputation. Moreover, the two decades that followed saw an avalanche of research on biases in social perception and cognition, providing an even stronger foundation for the critique (Dawes, 1988; Fiske & Taylor, 1990; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Taylor & Fiske, 1978). Many of the biases that were demonstrated were of just the sort that would be expected to generate illusions of consistency. For example, large distortions of memory for “facts” in the direction of preconceptions of various kinds were the stock-in-trade of numerous research papers of the 1970s and 1980s.

- It is important to note that Mischel did not argue that the absence of behavioral consistency across different situations proves that there are no measurable or predictable individual differences. On the contrary, he emphasized that individual actors might show responses that are very consistent within the same situation – that is, that specific responses to specific situations often might be very stable over time. In fact, some of the classic studies make this very point quite clearly. Stability coefficients – the correlation between two measures of the same behavior on different occasions – often exceed .40, sometimes reaching much higher. For example, Hartshorne and May (1928) found that the tendency to copy from an answer key on a general information test on one occasion was correlated .79 with copying from an answer key on a similar test six months later. Newcomb (1929) found that talkativeness at lunch was a highly stable attribute; it just wasn’t very highly correlated with talkativeness on other occasions (see also Buss & Craik, 1983, 1984).

He added to the personologists’ discomfort by claiming that the correlations between trait scores derived from standard personality assessment scales and objective behavioral outcomes were also very low. Individual behaviors could rarely be predicted with correlations beyond the .30 barrier, and typical correlations were lower. He then went on to point out that personality scales… ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2359))

- Finally, and perhaps most provocatively, Mischel proceeded to demonstrate that subjects’ willingness or ability to “delay gratification” (a trait dear to the hearts of psychoanalytically oriented personologists) might depend less on the dispositions of the person than on the specifics of the situation. Thus, while a child’s success in delaying gratification in any one situation – that is, forsaking a small immediate reward in favor of a later, more substantial one – could be predicted only to a modest degree (again with correlations generally less than .30) either from personality measures or from the child’s success in some other situation, the capacity of children in general to delay gratification successfully could be altered dramatically by manipulating some fairly subtle features of the situation testing that capacity. For example, in one study (Mischel & Ebbesen, 1970) it was found that most children quickly opted for the small but immediate reward when both rewards were made perceptually salient (a mean delay of one minute), but they managed to delay gratification (a mean delay of 11.3 minutes) when both rewards were hidden. Following up these results, Mischel (1974) and his co-investigators showed that any of several simple cognitive strategies that allowed children to divert their attention from the prospect of immediate reward could substantially enhance the capacity of virtually all children to delay gratification. In other words, such manipulations of context (and perhaps… ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2366))

Unlike most other critics, Bem did not disparage the existing behavioral data. Instead, he essentially conceded Mischel’s basic contention about the degree of cross-situational consistency to be found when a… ([Location 2381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2381))

Reviving a distinction made almost 40 years earlier by Gordon Allport (1937), and one used heavily by Mischel’s mentor George Kelly (1955), Bem and Allen (1974) proposed that personal consistencies of the sort implied by common trait labels can be found. But to do so, researchers must adopt an “idiographic” approach to personality as opposed to a “nomothetic” approach (that is, one focusing on the unique aspects of a given individual’s personality configuration instead of assuming that each person can meaningfully be assigned a score on every dimension of personality). The central feature of the idiographic approach is that one first identifies the particular traits that “apply” for the individual in… ([Location 2386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2386))

- only a subset of trait dimensions usefully characterizes any given individual, and that only a subset of individuals can be characterized in terms of any given trait dimension. A second feature of the idiographic approach is the willingness, in defining the subset of particular situations within which response consistency is to be found, to look to the individual actor for guidance. There are two distinct ways in which this can be done. One can observe people’s behavior in a substantial sample of situations to discover the particular consistencies shown by particular individuals (which presumably are likely to be shown by them again in a new sample of situations). Alternatively, one can use information about the person’s personal history, needs, goals, interpretive schemas, or the like, in an attempt to anticipate the… ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2394))

- on a fixed set of traits in a fixed set of situations. Instead, each individual would be expected to manifest his or her particular dispositions only in the particular subset of situations that were relevant for that individual. Bem and Allen’s theoretical departure point was the assumption that consistency will be shown only by people striving to meet personal standards or to convey a consistent impression to others, and it will be manifested only in the particular situations deemed relevant by those people. In other words, consistency will be manifested only by people who actively monitor their behavior and strive, at least within particular situations, to achieve the same consistency of performance predicted and sought by the researchers. For example, some people will monitor their behavior for the degree of friendliness or conscientiousness it displays because these personal attributes represent important values for them and are central to the impression they wish to convey to others. Other people will seek to be consistent in their displays of masculinity, intellectuality, ecological awareness, or patriotism for the same reason. But again, they will be consistent only across the particular situations that they personally deem relevant to the attribute in question. Unfortunately, as Bem and Allen acknowledged, their methodology did not proceed very far in the direction suggested by their theoretical analysis. They did try to identify a subset of potentially “consistent” actors (whose behavior was to be contrasted with a subset of actors expected to be “inconsistent”), but they did not do so on the basis of behavioral observation or analysis of the individual… ([Location 2401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2401))

Perhaps most important, and most at odds with the spirit of their own idiographic prescriptions, they made no attempt to choose their specific situations or measures idiographically. They simply selected a small number of situations and measures that they, the investigators, thought pertinent to the stipulated traits, and then exposed all their subjects to that same, fixed, set of situations. Finally, it should be noted that Bem and Allen employed only a very small number of discrete behavioral measures – two in the case of friendliness and three in the case of conscientiousness. Their other measures were all subjective, rather global, assessments by self, parents, or peers.

Like earlier personologists, they relied heavily on self-assessments and on subjective assessments by peers and parents. And like previous investigators, they were rewarded for doing so. In the case of both friendliness and conscientiousness, they found that the high-consistency subgroup’s peer ratings, parent ratings, and self-ratings correlated highly with each other (average r = .61 for friendliness and .48… ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2432))

- The Bem and Allen paper, perhaps more because of the force of its general arguments than the strength of its data, soon provoked a great deal of controversy and criticism, both from personologists who argued that the investigators’ approach had not been idiographic enough and from Mischelians who once again insisted that correlations involving objective behavioral measures rather than subjective assessments were most relevant to the main point under contention. Also, the single high correlation involving behavioral measures that Bem and Allen reported apparently has not stood the test of replication. Mischel and Peake (1982a), after duplicating the main aspects of the Bem and Allen procedure and adding several additional measures of both conscientiousness and friendliness, found mean correlations between individual pairs of behaviors of .13 for conscientiousness and .05 for friendliness. Similarly, Chaplin and Goldberg (1985) performed a conceptual replication of the Bem and Allen study and found a correlation of .01 for conscientiousness behaviors and .00 for friendliness behaviors. More importantly, neither set of investigators found any more evidence of differentially high correlations for allegedly consistent subjects than for allegedly inconsistent ones, using either of the classification measures that Bem and Allen employed. In sum, then, Bem and Allen’s initial steps in the direction of… ([Location 2439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2439))

- Epstein’s Claims for the Power of Aggregation Epstein’s (1979, 1983) answer to Mischel’s critique was one that appealed greatly to personologists. Essentially, he argued that in paying so much attention to low correlations between individual behaviors or outcomes, one overlooks the theoretical significance and potential practical benefits of aggregating observations. He pointed out that individual responses, like single items on a test of any kind, are highly unreliable and are likely to reflect the impact of many systematic and random factors other than the underlying personal disposition being measured. To obtain a reliable, accurate measurement of an actor’s disposition, therefore, one must take the average of several different individual measures, or “items,” so that random or extraneous factors influencing individual responses or items partially cancel each other out, and the signal becomes stronger relative to the surrounding noise. In other words, to find the consistency that had eluded the behaviorists, one need only make sure that the scores one correlates reflect a high proportion of the individual’s underlying personal dispositions, or “true score,” and a low proportion of “error.” The payoff, Epstein maintained, will be relatively high correlations that in turn reflect genuine, stable, personal dispositions.

- In a sense, Epstein’s argument was purely statistical and beyond dispute. No one can disagree with the contention that multiple observations offer a more reliable measure, and a more accurate reflection of the “truth,” than single observations. (Indeed, Mischel had made the same point in his 1968 book.) Moreover, in many familiar applied contexts, the importance of the aggregation principle is readily appreciated.

- specifically, let us consider the case of a data set yielding a mean correlation of .16 for pairs of measures, a correlation level that is actually a little on the high side for empirical studies of the sort we have outlined. Now a .16 correlation may seem unimpressive. Indeed, as Jennings, Amabile, and Ross (1982) showed, most observers are hard pressed to determine whether they are seeing a positive relationship or a negative one when they hear pairs of tones of differing durations, or see pairs of lines of differing lengths, that embody a .16 correlation. Nevertheless, it can be predicted, by use of the Spearman-Brown “prophecy formula” championed by Epstein, that if we took 25 independent behavioral measures of subjects’ extroversion or honesty or dependency or conscientiousness (that is, measures of just the kind we reviewed earlier in our discussion of Mischel’s challenge to the personologists) and correlated the average score of each subject for these 25 measures with the average score for another 25 independent measures of the same trait, ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2505))

- the resulting correlation would reach .83 – a correlation that no one would call unimpressive and that no one could fail to detect. Indeed, averaging together even nine independent measures for each subject and then looking at their relationship to the average of nine new measures would yield a clear, and easily detectable, correlation of .63. Epstein (1983) was not content to offer this argument in purely theoretical terms. He went to the trouble of demonstrating that, for at least some preferences and behaviors, the use of multiple measures really could boost correlations to the degree “prophesied.” (What this showed, in effect, was that the requirement for independence of measures could be met or, more likely, that it could be violated without much cost in terms of the boost in correlation resulting from aggregation.) Traditional personology thus received a major lift. It had been shown, or so it seemed, that individual differences do exist along traditional trait lines, and that correlations reflecting these differences can be made quite large if one ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2512))

- on knowledge of their past behavior in many relevant situations differ from the predictions we would have made if we had known nothing about these individuals? And how accurate, on average, would such predictions prove to be when tested over the long haul? The answers to these questions can be linked to an even more basic set of questions to which we feel neither the personologists nor their critics have devoted sufficient attention. What does an individual’s distribution of responses across many situations look like in a world where people show the degree of behavioral consistency that Mischel and Epstein both seem willing to agree on? For example, how frequently would an “extreme” individual show extreme behavior and how frequently would such a person look rather average? Conversely, how frequently would an “average” person look extreme? ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2533))

- Let us begin by outlining our basic conclusions. 1.   By measuring a great number of trait-relevant responses for each individual, we can arrive at a reliable and accurate estimate of each individual’s overall mean behavior, or “true score.” Accordingly, we can predict with great ([Location 2553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2553))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- accuracy the mean response that each individual will exhibit over a great number of future observations. Indeed, we can make accurate predictions about each individual’s entire distribution of responses. But to the extent that the individuals’ response distributions reveal them to be highly variable in their trait-relevant behavior – and that is exactly what must be revealed when the pertinent consistency correlations are all .16 – the uncertainty associated with predictions about any particular individual response by any individual actor cannot be reduced to any substantial degree. 2.   Our behavioral samples necessarily will show that although individual response distributions differ somewhat in their central tendencies, all individuals will show a wide range of responses, and all will make responses close to the overall population mean much more often than they make responses that are at all extreme. (Again, if this were not so, the relevant consistency correlations would ([Location 2556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2556))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- be higher than .16.) As a result, no amount of aggregation will ever allow one to predict that even the most sociable, impetuous, or conscientious actors in our observational study will behave in anything like an extremely sociable, impetuous, or conscientious fashion in any particular situation. Conversely, when extreme behavior is displayed by someone on a particular occasion, we will never be able to assume that we are observing an individual whose overall mean or true score is extreme rather than average. 3.   Examination of response distributions and mean scores for individuals nevertheless will serve us well for one type of prediction goal. Even on the basis of a correlation as low as .16 for individual responses, we will be able to make some pointed predictions about the relative likelihood that particular types of extreme responses will be shown by various specific individuals. Indeed, knowing that a particular individual has displayed an extremely “high” response on even a single occasion makes it safe to conclude that the person’s response on some other occasion is much more likely to be extremely high than extremely low. And knowing that an individual’s mean response over a great many observations is extreme makes these differences in the relative likelihood of particularly high or particularly low future scores reach dramatic levels indeed.

- will be immediately clear that even the most “extreme” children show decidedly average behavior more often than they show extreme behavior, and that even the most average children sometimes show behavior at the extremes. In short, when the relevant cross-situational consistency correlation is .16 the vast majority of the children show rather similar, and unexceptional, response distributions – the sort of distributions that would make one reluctant to use adjectives like “shy” or “aggressive” or even “average” without quickly adding some qualifications about variability.

- We begin with the qualitative aspects of lay personality theory. Are people really the inveterate trait theorists we have claimed them to be? We know, from research as well as from everyday experience, that people rely heavily on trait terms when asked to describe each other. Park (1986, 1989) found that while behaviors, affiliative memberships, attitudes, demographic information, and physical descriptions were all used with some frequency, traits (such as kind, shy, self-centered, easygoing) were more than twice as common as the next most frequent form of description. Ostrom (1975) asked college students to list the items of information they would want to know about another person in order to form an impression. Trait information accounted for 26 percent of all items listed; behavior, affiliative memberships, attitudes, and demographic and physical information together accounted for only 19 percent.

- which they call on aspects of the situation or overall social context. Joan Miller (1984) asked people to “describe something a person you know well did recently that you considered a wrong thing to have done” and also to “describe something a person you know well did recently that you considered good for someone else.” Immediately after describing each behavior, the subject was asked to explain why the behavior occurred. Half of the explanations offered by subjects for deviant behaviors invoked general dispositions (for example, “he is rather careless and inconsiderate”). This was three times the rate of offering situational context explanations (“it was hard to see, and the other bicycle was going very fast”). Similarly, for prosocial behaviors, one third of the explanations offered invoked general dispositions, and this was more than 50 percent higher than the rate for context explanations. Thus subjects showed themselves to be trait theorists, not situationists. ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2715))

- Such subjects were more apt to generate dispositional explanations (for example, the two students must have been gays or liberals) than situational ones (the students must have been asked in some manner that made it difficult for them to refuse). Perhaps the most convincing line of work showing the layperson’s reliance on dispositional constructs of a trait type comes from a series of investigations by Winter and Uleman (1984; Winter, Uleman, & Cunniff, ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2727))

- The evidence to date thus suggests that people automatically – and unconsciously – provide a dispositional interpretation to behavioral information (see also Park, 1986, 1989; Lewicki, 1986).

What do you suppose is the probability that in the next situation in which you observe them you would also find Jane to be more honest than Jill? Other subjects were asked about the degree of stability to be expected over two sets of 20 occasions. They were asked about the probability that Jane would prove more honest than Jill over the next 20 situations (on average) given that she had been more honest over the preceding 20 situations (on average). Similar questions were asked about the stability of honesty rankings. In all, cases, subjects were asked to make their estimates of likelihood on a scale running from 50 percent to 100 percent.

- .10. Figure 5.1 also reveals that subjects showed little appreciation of the stability gained from aggregation of measures. Subjects thought that the consistency from one situation to another was only trivially less than the consistency from 20 situations to another 20 situations! We can express this failure to recognize the instability of single measures relative to aggregate ones quite precisely. Given that subjects estimated the item-to-item correlation to be .79, they should have estimated the 20-item-to-20-item correlation to reach 99. Alternatively, given that subjects estimated the total correlation to be .82, they should have estimated the item-to-item correlation to be only .23. [Lest we be accused of picking on our statistically unsophisticated subjects, we remind the reader that we have emphasized throughout this book the continuity between lay and professional intuitions about behavior. In this spirit, Kunda and Nisbett asked professional psychologists, attending a convention symposium on statistical aspects of human judgment, to make the very same estimates as the college students whose data are shown in Figure 5.1. Some of these professionals would be describable as personologists, but most were social psychologists and experimentalists. The professional sample provided data that were essentially the same as those in Figure 5.1 – with one exception. The professional psychologists as a group were aware that traits are not very good predictors of behavior. (Or perhaps we should say they were reminded of that fact. Walter Mischel was seated prominently in the front of the room as they filled out their questionnaires!) In any case, the psychologists showed lower estimates of social trait consistency than did the lay subjects. Nevertheless, they still seriously overestimated the degree of consistency likely to be shown from one situation to the next. Moreover, like the lay subjects, they showed little recognition of the degree to which larger samples of observations enhanced consistency of rankings. As a result, they actually underestimated the ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2772))

- The latter point is particularly important because it suggests that people will make confident trait-based predictions on a small evidence base and will be unmotivated to increase their evidence base before making predictions. For abilities, by contrast, they will be inclined to insist on a relatively large sample of behavior before rendering confident judgments. Kunda and Nisbett argued that people are more accurate for abilities for several reasons. First, abilities are observed in fixed, highly repeatable situations. Second, ability-related behaviors are relatively easy to “code” unambiguously. Third, ability-related behaviors are often assessed in numerical terms, which greatly facilitates application of the law of large numbers and thereby enhances recognition of the advantages of ([Location 2795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2795))

- Evidence regarding lay views of cross-situational behavioral consistency, while highly suggestive, is still rather new and in need of further critical scrutiny. But evidence that people are inclined to offer dispositional explanations for behavior instead of situational ones, and that they make inferences about the characteristics of actors when they would do well to make inferences instead about the characteristics of situations is far from new. It has been the subject of intense critical scrutiny. It is appropriate to review this literature now, including some recent and unpublished data. The evidence indicates that laypeople’s vigorous personality theories are matched by only the most rudimentary and vestigial of social psychological perspectives. We will show that people (1) infer dispositions from behavior that is manifestly situationally produced, (2) overlook situational context factors of substantial importance, and (3) make overly confident predictions when given a small amount of traitrelevant information.

- Ignoring role determinants in favor of dispositional inferences. If people can fail to perceive the extent to which financial incentives rather than personal dispositions are determinative of behavior, then it is scarcely surprising to learn that they can also fail to perceive the extent to which subtler factors such as role relations can determine the nature of behavior. A deceptively simple demonstration of this point was made by Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz (1977). They asked their subjects to play a brief “College Bowl” type of quiz game, in which one subject, selected at random, was to ask the questions and the other was to answer them. The questioner’s role was to generate ten “challenging but not impossible questions,” to which the contestant was supposed to provide answers out loud. Questioners, again and again, took advantage of their role to display esoteric knowledge in the questions they posed (for example, “What is the sweet-smelling liquid that comes from whales and is used as a base for perfume?”) and in the answers they ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2850))

- supplied (in this case ambergris) when contestants failed to answer correctly. At the end of the session, both of the participants, and, in a subsequent reenactment, observers as well, were required to rate the questioner’s and contestant’s general knowledge. One might expect that it would have been clear to subjects and observers alike that the questioners’ role advantage had been quite substantial. That is, the questioners’ role guaranteed that they would reveal no area of ignorance, while the contestants’ role gave no opportunity for such selective, self-serving displays. But the role advantage of the questioner did not prove to be sufficiently obvious either to the contestants or to the observers to prevent them from judging the questioners as being unusually knowledgeable. Both contestants and observers rated the questioner as far more knowledgeable than either the contestant or the “average” student in the university.

- Pitting dispositions against situations. One study combines in a single demonstration both halves of the fundamental attribution error that is, an overeager dispositionism and an underdeveloped situationism. This is the classic Darley and Batson (1973) study of Princeton University theological seminary students, which we discussed at length in Chapter 2. A detail that we did not mention there was that their subjects were given a questionnaire intended to measure whether the basis for their interest in religion had to do primarily with assuring personal salvation or primarily with their concern for helping others. This fact means that Darley and Batson were able to compare the strength of a seemingly important dispositional variable with a “small” situational variable, namely, whether subjects believed themselves to be in a hurry as they passed by a person in apparent need of help. After filling out the questionnaire, subjects were instructed to go to a room in another building across campus where they were to give a sermon. It will be recalled that some of the subjects were told that their audience was already there and that the subject was unfortunately already somewhat late because ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2917))

- the experimenter had fallen a bit behind schedule. Other subjects assumed that they had plenty of time. The route subjects were to follow to the other building was clearly marked out for them and they were set upon their way. The parable of the Darley and Batson experiment is built upon another parable – the parable of the Good Samaritan. On the way to the new building, the seminary student was hailed by a man lying in a doorway, who asked for help. And did the seminary students offer their help? Did it make a difference what the nature of their religious orientation was? Did it make a difference whether or not they were in a hurry? The answers are, respectively: some, no, and a great deal. Sixty-three percent of subjects who were not in a hurry stopped to offer help to the “victim.” Only ten percent of subjects who were in a hurry offered help. In contrast, the dispositional measure concerning the nature of religious orientation played virtually no role in determining whether the subject stopped to help. The Darley and Batson experiment thus, in a sense, replicates but amends the lesson of the parable of the Good Samaritan. Their experiment invites us to surmise that all the priests and Levites who passed by on the other side of the road were simply running behind schedule!

- The situational variables proved more important than the relevant actors’ dispositions – more important, at least, than any dispositions salient to their peers. The evidence thus highlights serious flaws in some central tenets of lay personality theory. The evidence, in fact, is consistent with an extreme version of the fundamental attribution error. People readily make trait ascriptions from data that permit only a situational interpretation or, at most, the interpretation that the actor behaves in a particular way in a particular type of situation. These trait ascriptions are then used as the basis for yet further predictions, which, again, are characterized by little attention to situational factors. As we will see, people often must pay very dearly, in terms of prediction accuracy, for their adherence to such dispositionist theories and for the suboptimal inferential strategies to which they give rise.

- In a study by Dunning, Griffin, Milojkovic, and Ross (1990), cited in Chapter 3, a number of situations, either of the laboratory variety or of the everyday-life variety, were described to observer subjects. The observers then were asked to make predictions about the behavior of target individuals in these situations. For example, subjects were asked to predict whether a target would call home at least once a week during the coming quarter, and they were asked to predict whether he would “comb his hair when we ask him for a picture” in the context of a laboratory study. In one set of conditions, information available to raters about the individuals whose behavior they were predicting was quite abundant: Raters were allowed to interview the target individuals in preparation for the prediction task. In another set of conditions, information was scarce: Subjects had to make their predictions working only from the target individual’s name and picture. The results were clear-cut. The average accuracy in high-information conditions (60 percent correct) was only trivially higher than it was under low-information conditions (57 percent correct). This means that whatever information the participants were able to garner about one another through an interview designed to help them in making behavior predictions proved to be of very limited value. But perhaps people would not claim to be accurate about such oneshot predictions of behavior, even after an interview. Fortunately, the data of Dunning and his colleagues allow us to assess whether or not people think that knowledge about individuals helps them make predictions. The truth is that subjects actually believed that they could be rather accurate even when they had information only about the actor’s name and appearance! In such low-information conditions, where subjects were right about 57 percent of the time, their expected accuracy had been 72 percent. In high-information conditions, where subjects were right about 60 percent of the time, their expected accuracy had been 77 percent. Thus subjects were overconfident of their ability to make predictions under both high-and low-information conditions. In addition, confidence was poorly calibrated with accuracy. Subjects were only modestly more accurate, and therefore the gaps between accuracy and confidence levels were greatest, when they expressed high rather than low confidence in their predictions. As a consequence, subjects were rather often wrong despite being very confident, or even nearly ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=2989))

- situational factors were highly determinative). Subjects who went with the base rate when the base rate was at least 75 percent were right 85 percent of the time. Subjects who went against such base rates were right only 23 percent of the time. The latter subjects showed extreme miscalibration, thinking they were right 72 percent of the time! The moral of these studies seems clear. For predictions of the kind studied by Dunning and colleagues, and by Newton and colleagues (where subjects were asked to predict who would be most likely and who least likely to contribute to a food drive), the base rate, whether known or presumed, is the best basis for prediction. When the base rate is extreme, one can oppose it in one’s predictions only at one’s dire peril. And this is true even if the target is someone who the predictor knows well. The base rate, it should be noted, essentially serves as the proxy for the power of the situation. When the situation is particularly powerful, the base rate is very extreme. It is risky, accordingly, to oppose the ([Location 3014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3014))

- Observers were less accurate than they believed, and they did not improve on their accuracy by adding their knowledge about the target to their presumed base rates for the situation, even though they believed that they had improved their accuracy by drawing on such knowledge. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, at least when it increases confidence far more than it increases accuracy. (See also Borgida & Nisbett, 1977; Nisbett & Borgida, 1975.)

- As the above discussion indicates, sometimes one is better off by virtue of knowing dispositional information about individuals. We may now discuss the cases where the conventional wisdom turns out to be correct, at least in outline. We hinted earlier at one case where individual difference information can be invaluable. This is where one has base rate information for the particular individual for the particular situation. Thus your prediction that Jack will talk a lot at the lunch table today, as in the past, is bankable, as is your prediction that your spouse will complain about the next party where people are standing around talking and drinking. It is entirely likely, in fact, that lay convictions about the utility of traits are in part based on an overgeneralization from successful ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3079))

- predictions based on narrow, within-situation stability. But even predictions made across different types of situations can have genuine utility. In the previous chapter we elaborated some special circumstances where trait-based predictions can be made with good prospects for accuracy. These include the following: (1) The prediction is based on a large, diverse sample of past observations, and pertains not to a single action or outcome, but to an average expected over the “long haul.” (2) The prediction deals with the relative likelihood of extreme outcomes or events, and the actors have in the past shown themselves to be extreme relative to others. (3) The predictions are mindful of population base rates. In particular, extreme base rates and the situational pressures they reflect cannot be overlooked with impunity.… ([Location 3084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3084))

- Why does the observer then go on to make a dispositional attribution corresponding to the form of behavior observed? Heider again was clear on this: . . . Man is not content simply to register the observables that surround him; he needs to refer them as far as possible to the invariances of his environment. . . . the underlying causes of events, especially the motives of other persons, are the invariances of the environment that are relevant to him; they give meaning to what he experiences. . . . (p. 81) We need only add an explanation of why it is the dispositional properties of the person rather than those of the environment that people tend to infer when observing the person in the environment. To be succinct, what you attend to is what you attribute to. ([Location 3110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3110))

- The preceding analysis, incidentally, implies that the actor and the observer will have very different understandings of the causes of the actor’s behavior. The observer will be inclined to invoke dispositions of the actor, whereas the actor will be inclined to invoke situational opportunities and constraints. Jones and Nisbett (1972) argued that this is, in fact, generally the case. Actors tend to give fewer dispositional explanations for their behavior than observers do. For example, in the study cited earlier by Nisbett and his colleagues (1973), observers inferred that actors who volunteered for money were the volunteering type while those who didn’t volunteer, for much less money, were not the volunteering type. But the actors themselves explained their behavior in terms of the sum of money they ([Location 3123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3123))

- were offered. The same pattern was true for subjects asked to explain why they chose their college major and why they dated the person they did. The actor preponderantly explained such choices in terms of the properties of the stimulus (“I date her because she’s a very warm person”), while the observer was more likely to invoke dispositions of the actor (“He dates her because he’s very dependent and needs a nonthreatening girlfriend”). In addition, Nisbett and his colleagues found that actors believe that fewer trait terms are applicable to them than to their best friends, a new acquaintance, or even a well-known news commentator. Rampant dispositionism is kept in check when it is the self that is in question. ([Location 3128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3128))

- Both actors attributed their behavior primarily to situational factors, such as the behavior of the other actor and the unusual situational context. Observers were more inclined to attribute the actors’ behavior to inferred dispositions. However, when the observer was shown a videotape of the conversation that focused on the actor he could not previously observe well, that is, on the situation confronting his actor, he now gave attributions that resembled those of the actor himself. Even more remarkably, when the actor was shown a videotape of himself, he then made attributions that were similar to those of observers! The results of Storms’ study thus support the view that attribution is guided to a very substantial degree by one’s focus of attention and that a primary reason that actors and observers have different casual interpretations is simply because actors and observers typically are attending to different things.

- Statistics and the Dispositionist Bias Finally, it should be noted that some commonplace statistical failings help sustain the dispositionist bias. First, people are rather poor at detecting correlations of the modest size that underlie traits (Chapman & Chapman, 1967, 1969; Kunda & Nisbett, 1986; Nisbett & Ross, 1980). Second, people have little appreciation of the relationship of sample size to evidence quality. In particular, they have little conception of the value of aggregated observations in making accurate predictions about trait-related behavior (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kunda & Nisbett, 1986). The gaps in people’s statistical abilities create a vacuum that the perceptual and cognitive biases rush in to fill. The very factors that allow or encourage people to hold the personality theory that they do in the abstract, it should be noted, will tend also to lower the utility with which the theory is applied to individual predictions in daily life (Nisbett, 1980). Most importantly, people are likely to inflate the consistency values that they associate with particular traits for particular people. We can safely assume that they habitually will assign trait scores of greater extremity, with greater confidence, than is appropriate. This means that they readily will make predictions, with assurance, that a sophisticated personologist would recognize to be inappropriate.

- Of course, many of us today spend most of our time with nonintimates and must constantly make judgments of some importance about nearstrangers. So the errors of lay personality theory we have been describing are not mere foibles. In the next chapter we will examine the implications of the predictive failures we have discussed in this one. Do these failures generate chaos for us in our attempts to coordinate our behavior with that of others? It would seem not, and thus there is a paradox. We deal with nonintimates all the time; we hold erroneous theories about the basis of their behavior; and yet we somehow seem to muddle through without an enormous number of prediction errors on a daily basis. What spares us? It is this question to which we next turn our attention. ([Location 3190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3190))

- In fact, the more one thinks about the realities of our day-to-day experiences with each other, the more difficult it becomes to accept the conclusions seemingly demanded by the “objective” studies of crosssituational consistency reviewed in Chapter 4. We do not dispute the charge that perceptual, inferential, and perhaps even motivational biases may lead us to see more behavioral consistency and predictability than any purely objective analysis would ([Location 3220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3220))

Reconciling experience with the scientific evidence from objective studies demands that we reflect further upon the predictability of everyday social events – predictability we believe would be documented by even the most objective account of our experiences, and that we count on heavily in planning and conducting our lives. More specifically, we must try to understand how and why everyday social behavior may, in fact, be highly stable and highly predictable, even though appropriately designed empirical tests reveal cross-situational behavioral correlations fully as low as Mischel and company claim.

- we intertwine our lives, owes much to the relative consistency of the situational forces and constraints that govern those particular individuals – or at least govern them when they interact with us. In the course of ordinary experience, we rarely have a chance to observe the same people in radically different roles or situations in a way that would test fairly the cross-situational consistency of their geniality, generosity, or ability to delay gratification. Nor do we systematically vary our own behavior, or our status and circumstances, or the nature of our relationships with others, to determine how their responses to us might change as a result. Accordingly, we are not forced (indeed, not even given the opportunity) to appreciate the power of the relevant role demands and to disentangle dispositional influences from situational ones. Quite the contrary, we count on the fact that particular roles and relationships will render people’s behavior predictable – despite the fact that broader, less “biased,” and more “scientific” samples of behavior ([Location 3244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3244))

- It is precisely the confounding of person and situation that allows people to be well served by their naive dispositionism. When we predict that the behavior of professors will be professorial, that the behavior of dictators will be dictatorial, or that the behavior of servants will be servile, it makes little difference whether we do so because we are aware of the impact of the respective roles, ([Location 3293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ZTTTL2&location=3293))

- because we have made stereotyped judgments about the types of individuals who occupy such roles, or because we have taken role-prescribed behavior at face value and ascribed corresponding personality traits to the actor. In each case, the performances we observe more often than not will confirm our predictions and justify the relevant trait ascription – professorial, dictatorial, or servile – provided, of course, that we continue to observe the actors in circumstances where the privileges and constraints of their roles remain in effect, and provided that no other powerful situational factors suddenly intrude. Misattributions can have similarly benign consequences in contexts where the immediate determinants of a particular person’s behavior are less easy to detect. Thus our failure to recognize that Mrs. Jones’ reclusiveness and secretiveness reflect the impact of an abusive, alcoholic husband (whom we may never even have met) will not undermine the accuracy of our predictions about Mrs. Jones’ future behavior – unless and until she escapes from the situation that is constraining her. By the same token, we will suffer no adverse consequences from our failure to recognize how much a particular benefactor’s consistent generosity owed to the tax code, or how much a particular congresswoman’s consistently liberal rhetoric reflects the prejudices of her district – until we base our hopes on that benefactor’s generosity continuing in the absence of tax advantages or on that politician’s rhetoric being translated into political action when she becomes a member of the president’s cabinet.
