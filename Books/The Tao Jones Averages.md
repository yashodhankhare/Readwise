## Highlights
- The half-brained experts can only tell you what’s already happened – they have a lousy record for predicting the future. There is more to financial analysis than hard logic. You have to use both sides of your brain to beat the market. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=48))

- Thus, the visual, intuitive, and sensing qualities of the right hemisphere, missing from the thinking of most experts, were necessary to sense change in the early stages. By reading over 150 publications on a regular basis, our firm was frequently able to show clients where change was beginning to happen long before it could be measured by the numbers.

- How can one win when institutional investors not only control 50 percent of stock equity ownership and over 70 percent of the volume of shares traded on the N.Y. Stock Exchange, but also have access to the information compiled by such brilliant analytic scholars? Logically speaking, it doesn't make sense for individuals to play the market. Well, there is bad news and good news: If we are the pioneers in the wagon train, we must face the fact that the cavalry isn't coming to save us—but don't despair, for there aren't any Indians! Most individual investors cannot gain proper access to sophisticated institutional research. But don't worry, because it doesn't work! The pros are not beating the market; it is beating them!

- Why do investment professionals get such poor marks? The main reason is that they are victims of their own methodology. By making a science out of an art, they are opting to be precisely wrong rather than generally correct. By creating the illusion of certainty where there is none, analysts are continually surprised by changing conditions. As Mitzi Malevich, a senior investment officer of the St. Paul Companies, states, "Next to Congress, Wall Street analysts are the greatest lagging indicator around." Like the message tape in "Mission Impossible," they tend to self-destruct. The "pros" are just not keeping up with "the Joneses"—that is, with the Dow Jones Averages.

- The Nature Of The Market Versus Fundamental Analysis Wall Street does not seem to have figured out what Mr. Edward C. Johnson, Jr., of Fidelity Management, the now retired "dean of Wall Street," understood when he said, "I have been absorbed and immersed since 1924 in the market and I know this is no science. It is an art form...It is a personal intuition, sensing patterns of behavior." Yet despite the fact that the market is famous for its fickle, crowdlike behavior, the Street's research analysts keep applying rules of logic and formula thinking. Behaving like the fanatic (one who, when he loses sight of his goals, redoubles his efforts), they apply logic to an illogical game. By applying male (yang) logic to the market's female (yin-type) behavior, professional investors are often guilty of what Lao Tsu referred to as "trying to understand running water by catching it in a bucket." A herd is a synonym for a crowd, and as John Train states in Dance of the Money Bees, "The herd instinct seems to be the strongest human emotion, one that the race is constantly breeding off as the mavericks are liquidated. Happiness is running with the crowd." Gustave Le Bon's book, The Crowd, still considered by many to be the most definitive work on mass psychology despite its 1895 publishing date, explains how a crowd goes from controlled logic to uncontrolled emotion, resulting in conscious personalities vanishing into a collective mind. The crowd, as opposed to the individual, possesses the spontaneity, violence, ferocity, and heroics of primitive beings. If you have been wondering about the success of Wall Street analysts' scientific, logical, fundamental approach to coping with crowd behavior, you're not alone. It is fair to say that the disenchantment with institutional research is reaching epidemic proportions, and the record shows why: It is illogical to treat the market logically.

- The fundamental approach to security analysis, though its popularization started in 1963 with the Burlington Industries report, actually began in 1934 when Graham and Dodd published Security Analysis, a 778-page bible for the scientific study of corporations. This book, which contains 178 pages on financial measurements, is...well, boring. It has nonetheless been through three editions, and can be found on the bookshelves of most security analysts. Graham and Dodd believed that each stock has an inherent value based on its earnings power (earnings-per-share ÷ price = price-earnings ratio) which can be determined by carefully following the economy, the company's industry, and the company itself. Sounds simple enough, but as Casey Stengel said, "Knowing how to do something and doing it are two different things."

- It is very easy for the professional money manager to mistake activity for effectiveness as he plows through his daily paper snowstorm. 4) Since analysts talk to the same corporate managers and to each other, and look at the same statistics, it is no wonder that they have a tendency to reach similar conclusions. This in turn tends to lull professional investors into a false sense of security through consensus forecasts. Their mathematical complexities tend to provide a false feeling of scientific precision. As E. F. Schumacher said in 1961, "Make a guess, call it an assumption, and derive an estimate by subtle calculation. The estimate is then presented as a result of scientific reasoning, something far superior to mere guesswork. Colossal planning errors result because the method offers a bogus answer where the entrepreneurial judgment is required."

- Managers are thus encouraged, even coerced, to join with the lemmings as they march toward the sea cliffs. Scary, isn't it? It is also scary to realize that the power of the articulate and brilliant analytic mind is not confined to Wall Street, but is pervasive throughout Western society. Our MBA and other professional schools continue to grind out technocrats. We have become so caught up in our scientific methodology that if something cannot be measured or counted, it will not be believed. As a result, we tend to adapt the world to our belief systems, rather than try to understand it as it is. In dealing with a changing world, we often try to "catch water in a bucket" rather than go with the flow. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=221))

- Though the philosophy of Taoism is marvelously simple, it is difficult to describe in words. The first line of Lao Tsu's great book, the Tao Te Ching, reads, "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao." The Tao means "the Way," the way of the universe that cannot be adequately described in words. Taoism, along with Confucianism and Buddhism, is one of the three great philosophic teachings of China. Like the Judeo-Christian tradition, it has a concept of duality—but with an important difference. The Judeo-Christian tradition emphasizes opposing dualities, such as heaven and hell, good and evil, God above and Devil below. Taoism, on the other hand, stresses unity and the interrelationship of all things. Its notion of duality is one of polarity, in which the yin (female) and the yang (male), good and evil, pleasure and pain, are seen as complementary poles that cannot exist without one another. Despite these commonalities and the fact that Lao Tsu and Confucius were likely contemporaries some 2,500 years ago, Taoism and Confucianism are best known for their contrasts. Confucius believed in the worship of ancestors, strict morality, high court etiquette, and the importance of rules and names. Taoism, on the other hand, advocates cooperation with the universal laws of nature while avoiding the artificial doctrines invented by man. As Lao Tsu stated, "To attain knowledge, add things every day; to obtain wisdom, remove things every day." Knowledge is the goal of Confucius, whereas Taoism strives for wisdom. Confucius is remembered as one of the world's great scholars, whereas Lao Tsu, in saying that the "sage sees and hears no more than an infant sees and hears," can be seen as a keen but simple observer of nature.

- In a world where dynamic change is a constant, one has to go with the flow in order to survive. As Lao Tsu said, "To resist change is like holding your breath—if you persist, you will die." Therefore, Lao Tsu's advice that "man must accept motion, must live with motion, and must know himself to be forever moving" is even more relevant today than when first uttered. Unfortunately, Western mentality with its analytic ways tends to resist change by making fixity out of flux, or as Lao Tsu would say, it tries to understand running water by catching it in a bucket. Since one cannot analyze change until after it has happened, our Western approach to information leaves us dealing with events after the fact rather than as a part of the flow. Moreover, our societal disease of what I call "analexia" (our conviction that if something cannot be analyzed or measured, it is not real) is accompanied by our passion for numbers. By depending on expertise, we have become less dependent on ourselves. By so downgrading our trust in our intuitions and feelings, we settle too often for the false comforts of doctrines and beliefs. Considering the predictive records of economists and other information specialists, it is quite clear that such trust has too often been unrewarded. In effect, by attempting to fit life's events into the framework of rigid form, we tend to exhaust our energies by trying to freeze the flow of the current. For these reasons, Taoism has the potential of being a catalyst for freeing the "fixity" of the Western view. But what, after all, is Taoism? What is it about this ancient philosophy that has influenced so many, including this author? What is it about Lao Tsu, a simple man of few words, that has caught the imaginations of generations of people around the world? His philosophy is simple, but not easy. His main principles, for instance, fall under such improbable headings as Wu Wei (the law of reverse effort), the newborn child, catching running water in a bucket, P'u (the uncarved block), Te (being with the Tao), and Judo (the "gentle way" of martial arts). The Tao means "the Way"—the underlying nature of the universe. It is as if there were a central axis around which everything revolves in an interrelated way. Though this concept could provide a rationale for astronomy, Lao Tsu was not interested in observing planetary activities, but rather those of nature and inner man. For Lao Tsu, "without going beyond one's nature, one can achieve ultimate wisdom." To achieve wisdom and power, you merely need to understand the five simple workings of nature that reflect universal principles, then learn to cooperate with events rather than fight them. Though Lao Tsu believes in the interconnectedness of all things, he does not advocate predestination, but says rather that one who possesses Te (the power of being in tune with the Tao) can positively influence his life by observing and fitting into the natural flow of things. By understanding the nature… ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=284))

- To utilize the power of the uncarved block, one has to return to childlike ways by unlearning the rules of man and society, and thus be free to allow the unconscious mind to work effectively. We should learn to appreciate the uncarved block, the inner virtue, in all things. Such awareness will result in our not trying to make something or someone be different from its true nature (e.g., by not putting square pegs into round holes). Thus, one should "accept what is weak for what strength it has, and use what is dim for the light it gives." The sage does not desire to change others. Lao Tsu, perhaps in part as a rebuff to the many followers of Confucius, was an outright ridiculer of scholars, who, he felt, devised rules that conflicted with the basic laws of nature and thus interfered with our ability to be in touch with our unconscious, our uncarved block. Scholars' conscious minds, he felt, acquired knowledge for the sake of knowledge… ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=315))

- Lao Tsu suggests using observation to understand the laws of nature and the universe. But what about understanding the laws of man, which he admits tend to be artificial? In dealing with one's fellowman, Lao Tsu suggests employing the principles of water. Of all substances "nothing is weaker than water; yet, for attacking what is hard and tough, nothing surpasses it." Water seeks the lowest place and thus is humble and receptive, like the female yin. Water adapts to the shape… ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=323))

- In dealing with one's fellowman, Lao Tsu recommends that one be humble, flexible, adaptable, and accepting of change as a way of life. The principle Lao Tsu calls Wu Wei, which literally means "not doing," is the doctrine of inaction, sometimes called the law of reverse effort. Wu Wei does not mean total passivity,… ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=329))

- rolling with the punches, swimming with the current, and winning by attraction and attitude rather than by deed and compulsion. Examples of the law of reverse effort are many. For instance, when you try to float, you sink, but when you try to sink, you float. When you try to remember a name, you can't, but when you stop thinking about it, it appears forthwith. When you hold your breath, you lose it, but when you let it go, you regain it. Wu Wei means succeeding by attitude rather than action; it is having the power of the infectious wish that comes from certain virtues such as compassion, moderation, and humility. In applying the principle of Wu Wei to the affairs of men, Lao Tsu made reference to government and teaching. In government, one should "govern a large country as you would cook a small fish—lightly." Lao Tsu would not recommend, as did Confucius, that copious rules be imposed upon people, for "the more laws are enacted and taxes assessed, the… ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=331))

- When it comes to the stock market, Taoism can be used to justify many different methodologies. For instance, the technician would encourage one to "go with the flow" of what others are buying and selling. The fundamentalist would say that successful investing depends upon knowing the "way" of the economy, industries, and companies. Finally, the contrarian would advise generosity, like "the sage who prefers being the creditor," by giving others the stocks they… ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=340))

- These responses suggest that there is a flip side or possible liabilities and flaws for those who are exceptionally "brilliant." Looking at the brain and how it operates, it is interesting to see that we have two brains within our neocortex: a left and right hemisphere. Furthermore, each person is dominated by either one side or the other. Though these twin hemispheres look alike, recent brain research indicates they control very different functions.

- It is becoming increasingly clear that it is important for each hemisphere to do the mental task for which it is best suited—to match the right tool with the right job. This is easier said than done, as our minds are often dominated by one side or the other, and we have a strong tendency to rely too heavily on our dominant mode. Each of us shows a dominant preference for one side of our body or the other; cases of true ambidexterity are rare. We have a dominant hand, foot, and even eye. (Note: To test for your dominant eye, point to a small object across the room and shut first one eye and then the other. The eye that is "on target" is your dominant eye.) There is a good reason for dominance; if one side did not control the other, we would often end up like Buridan's Ass (the symbol of indecisiveness because it starved to death equidistant between two bales of hay). There is, in fact, growing evidence that dyslexia occurs in cases where there are verbal skills in both hemispheres. Indecisive mental processing occurs as the two sides vie for control.

- As interesting as the above delineation may be, Herrmann would be the first to point out that we are talking about dominance, not either/or thinking. Those who are most successful in their careers are integrating qualities of both halves of their brains in their thought processes. It is also important to note that the chart does not happen to mention that Wall Street research analysts are strongly left-brain oriented, whereas portfolio managers tend to be more oriented to the right hemisphere.

- With the advent of the computer, which "thinks" sequentially in digital form, the left brain was given a powerful tool to extend its capabilities. Our modern obsession with numbers has resulted in a "Cognitive Era," and our obsession with measurement has created a prevalent philosophy that if it can't be counted, it doesn't count. Though we are told not to compare apples and oranges, we continually do so by translating them into numbers. In the process, we tend to lose track of their intangible properties such as taste, nutrition, and aesthetics. An increase in specialization has accompanied the rise of science and technology. Specialized left-brain oriented professions have proliferated, and aided by the perception that the government saved America from the Great Depression, the "FDR syndrome" has developed. This refers to our society's awe of experts, the idea that ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=483))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- someone else—the government, doctor, lawyer, educator, etc.—is better able to look after our lives than we are. This syndrome has resulted in a lack of confidence in ourselves. Our passion for measurement has made our destinies more and more determined by IQ and other tests that measure only half our brains. Those who qualify for college and graduate schools by SAT and other test scores are not necessarily those who are balanced and who have good judgment, but rather those with imbalanced, left-brained mental specialization. In turn, these scholars swell the ranks of the educators and thus perpetuate the system. Has this shift to our "scientific" logical mind worked? In one sense, its track record has certainly been impressive. After years of slow evolution, man's ability to pass his knowledge on in written form to the next generation has resulted in advancements that have allowed us to put a man on the moon, split the atom, and communicate through the airways. The fact that 90 percent of the scientists who have ever lived are alive today is a rather impressive statement about the growth dynamics of the Cognitive Era.

- It is becoming increasingly clear that our trend toward technocratic, left-brained specialization in business has reached a point of diminishing returns. These very experts in whom business has placed its trust have failed by not being sensitive to changing situations. Furthermore, they have created an overload of information that has often obscured reality. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=505))

- By declaring in the first line of the Tao Te Ching that the "way of the universe" cannot be adequately described in words, Lao Tsu shows his disdain for the language skills that are identified with the left hemisphere. He later adds, "Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know," thus leaving us with little doubt about how he would view the "articulate incompetent." For Lao Tsu, man needs to overcome a lifetime habit of expressing thoughts only in words. Lao Tsu recommended that we "discard knowledge and the people would benefit a hundredfold." Of man, he said, "Even though he may be a 'walking encyclopedia,' he is really a misguided fool." He also said, "If we stop fussing about grammatical trivialities, we will get along much better." Such statements indicate that Lao Tsu not only placed little value on the scholarship qualities of the left hemisphere, but also viewed them as frankly negative traits. "Day after day the overzealous student stores up facts for future use. But he will discard formula after formula, until he reaches the conclusion, Let nature take its course." In short, Lao Tsu feels that ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=527))

- "expertise" does not work, that left-hemispheric logic is incapable of leading us to the higher wisdom of intuitive knowing. He complains about the scholars who study for the sake of knowledge and who then create a barrier of words between themselves and common people. As Lao Tsu laments, "Nature's way is simple and easy, but men prefer the intricate and the artificial." Therefore, "The wise are not learned and the learned are not wise." "The power of intuitive understanding will protect you from harm until the end of your days." "The sage is guided by what he feels." Such statements by Lao Tsu show his preference for those qualities of the right hemisphere. True education comes from unlearning the artificial rules of man, as indicated by the saying, "The sage sees and hears no more than an infant sees and hears." Teaching should not be done by describing and pointing out differences, but by example. Understanding is a matter of intuitive sensing, not the result of some discipline. By stating, "Without going beyond one's nature, one can achieve ultimate wisdom," Lao Tsu is giving right-brained knowing the highest accolade. Throughout the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tsu downgrades the role of logical, verbal, sequential thinking at all turns, whether it relates to areas of human interaction, affairs of state, or the discovery of wisdom. He believes that "the way of the universe" can be understood only through perception of nature, by using the attributes of the right brain. Since man and nature are in constant motion, a notion Fritjor Capra in his book The Tao of Physics claims is being verified by recent scientific findings, Lao Tsu feels that the world needs to be sensed directly. By saying that running water can't be understood by catching it in a bucket, he is observing the inability of the left hemisphere to deal with motion and change. Lao Tsu's constant bias for right-brained qualities is so strong and consistent that his writing can be viewed as an appeal for right-headedness. One could even go so far as to call the right brain the "Lao Tsu brain." The increasing popularity of Taoism in the West is another confirmation that the Cognitive Era is gradually giving way to a greater increase in right-brained values. However, our society is still dominated by left-hemispheric values, and if Lao Tsu were to reappear today, the "experts" would no doubt echo the sentiments Confucius expressed after the only meeting of the two philosophers: "I just don't understand Lao Tsu." In effect, what they would be saying is that they just do not understand the nonverbal, intuitive, feeling side of their own cerebrum.

- Though definitive studies have not yet been published about the brain dominance of minorities, there is an interesting possibility that blacks, Indians, and other minorities have been discriminated against not so much because of their skin color but because of their right-brained thought preference. One indication of their dominance is the success of blacks in basketball, a spatial, nonprogrammed sport if there ever was one. Seventy-two percent of the players in the NBA are black.

- The growth of left-brained thinking during the Cognitive Era has not been without its side effects. As we became more conditioned to distrust our own personal instincts in favor of "experts," we were also attracted to drinking to relieve our anxieties. Our left brain, the censor of our emotional right side, becomes tranquilized by alcohol. Just as meditation stills the left brain by giving it the simple task of repeating a mantra, so alcohol numbs the analytic mind so that our right hemisphere can be "let out of its cage." As we get high, physiologically speaking we are achieving a better balance and we thus tend to feel more complete. If this theory is correct, it may help explain why American Indians have trouble drinking. Since their left brain is their minority mode, drinking can more easily anesthetize their "censor," leaving them out of control. John Marshall, founder of Right On, a Los Angeles organization that works with alcoholics ("experienced drinkers," as he prefers to call them), is fascinated with recent medical discoveries about the two brains. As he says, "Drinking is the easiest, most effective, most economical, and most accepted way to give the overworked half of the brain relaxation while the other half has a chance to express itself." The Persians long ago sensed the relationship between booze and our two modes of thinking: "If an important decision is to be made [the Persians] discuss the question when they are drunk, and the following day the master of the house where the discussion was held submits their decision for reconsideration when they are sober. If they still approve it, it is adopted; if not, it is abandoned. Conversely, any decision they make when sober is reconsidered afterwards when they are drunk."—Herodotus, The Histories (ca. 450 B.C.), Psychology Today, December 1979.

- Where Wall Street Is Headed The dominant role of security analysts in the decision-making of professional investors is a key to Wall Street's mind-set; after all, they are called analysts. These highly paid researchers use logic by combing through the numbers, interviewing corporate managers, and then passing on their recommendations to the investment community as to whether a stock is a buy, hold, or sell. As logical, brilliant, and hard-working as these professionals may be, the lack of success of their recommendations speaks for the ineffectiveness of their approach. Unlike the Japanese, analysts do not take a whole-brained approach to understanding the world. By applying left-brained logic to the illogical stock market, they often are using the wrong tool for the task. Though tests have not been done, it is quite likely that the majority of those investors who consistently outperform the market value their right-brained qualities, for that is the side that can best sense the rapidly changing world of the stock market. Lao Tsu, if he were a professional money manager, would probably not read institutional research reports, as he would feel that they would fill up the mind, preventing it from seeing the true nature of things.

- A couple recently took their five-year-old son to interview for placement in the first grade of one of New York's most prestigious private boys' schools. As David's behavior was exemplary throughout the interview, his parents began to relax. Then the director of admissions, a stuffy young man with an English accent, asked David how many letters there were in his own name. "Four," declared David crisply. "I'm sorry, David, you are wrong," replied the interviewer, "there are five letters in your name." "No, four," stated David emphatically. "David," replied the interviewer, moving forward in his chair, "there are five letters in David." "Noooo, there are only four letters," David stated with set jaw. Eyes narrowing, the admissions director stated, "Five, D-A-V-I-D; that is five." "I knew you were wrong," David triumphed. "There are four, as everyone knows that there are two D's in David!" For a scholar not to know something is practically a crime. Haven't we all had abuse heaped on us when we didn't get the answer that the teacher thought was right? The process is so intimidating that many adults have recurring nightmares about not having done their homework or about being unable to answer even one of the questions on a test. Consequently, most of us give a silent cheer when we hear the story about young David slaying the giant admissions director (who, incidentally, got the last word by not accepting David). Unfortunately, not many of us triumph over our educational system. It is so pervasive that sooner or later the inevitable happens. We start out as butterflies, and end up in cocoons. Our typical educational format consists of a teacher imparting knowledge to a class, typically of fifteen to thirty students who are supposed to receive and absorb the intended messages. This educational system emphasizes being "right" at the expense of being open, and teaches our young to be still, to look to authority, and to construct certainties. It ingrains self-limiting behavior and promotes competition for the highest grades. As Marilyn Ferguson states in The Aquarian Conspiracy, "Conventional schools tend to be instruments of our greatest denial by breaking knowledge and experience into subjects, relentlessly… ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=633))

- Mark Haroldsen, in his million-copy seller How to Wake Up the Financial Genius Inside You, lists eight qualities for success: belief, drive, desire, positive mental attitude, determination, discipline, excitement, and motivation. Despite the fact that of these eight qualities only one (discipline) is left-brain oriented, our Western educational system stresses verbal skills, sequential reasoning (cause and effect), scientific theory and, of course, reading, writing, and arithmetic. So constituted, there is a high correlation between high grades and IQ scores. Conversely, a study of engineering students by Don Taylor at Yale University indicates that there is virtually no correlation between grades and intuition. Considering such evidence, it is no wonder that Dr. Roger Sperry states, "Our educational system and modern society generally discriminate against one whole half of the brain. In our present educational system, the attention given to the right hemisphere of the brain is minimal compared with the training lavished on the left side." Such an educational bias, which is further reinforced by testing, has led to what I call "analexia," our society's compulsion to accept only what can be measured.

- If our educational system is left brained, and Lao Tsu, on the other hand, is right brained, whom should we believe? The answer is neither and both. Neither should be blindly followed, as to do so would be to act in a half-brained way. Nor should we ignore either, for each effectively represents its half of the brain. By understanding both and being able to use the correct hemisphere for the correct task, we can be more whole brained and effective in our decision-making. Whole-brainedness, in turn, results in creative thought processes. In 1945 Graham Wallas developed in The Art of Thought a simple model for creativity that illustrates how creativity involves the whole brain. This model, which is the one most commonly used regarding creativity, consists of four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Preparation is "doing your homework," researching the situation, searching for information, and it is best performed primarily by left-hemispheric skills. Incubation is "sleeping on it," taking a walk, or just reflecting. It takes place when the left brain idles (emits alpha waves) and the right mulls things over in its own nonverbal way. Illumination takes place when the two brains come together, when the left side is able to verbalize the intuitive understanding of the right. This coming together of the two minds can be so powerful that it often produces the enlightenment, the oceanic feeling, that sent Archimedes jumping out of the tub shouting "Eureka." Verification is the process whereby the left brain confirms the validity of the discovery. Looking at Wallas's model for creativity, the stages of preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification can be classified hemispherically as left, right, both, and left. This suggests, indeed, that creativity and its counterpart, discovery, are whole brained. Einstein, when he quipped that he seemed to get his ideas while shaving in the morning, was in reality referring to the process whereby his left verbal hemisphere was combining with the right hemisphere's incubation that had been performed while he was asleep.

- Lao Tsu's statement, "The wise are not learned and the learned are not wise," certainly does not suggest whole-brainedness, but rather the opposite: an either/or situation. It is here that hemispheric brain research would take issue with our venerable philosopher; it suggests that both hemispheres need development and interaction. Ideally, education should be designed to bolster both brains, as we need to learn to make our intuition an equal partner with logic. Considering the strong bias in favor of the left, how can the right also be educated? Our educational system, of course, is not a total failure. It is doing an adequate job training the brain hemisphere that it is concerned about (even here there is mounting criticism of the system). Its major failing is that it misses the mark through omission; it does too little for the right. What is needed is not an elimination of what is being done, as Lao Tsu might advocate, but rather a scaling back of what is being taught and an increase in courses and methods that are not presently offered. It is interesting that the development of most children's drawing skills tends to stop at about the same time, at the age of ten. Such a phenomenon is odd, when one considers that a child's hand-eye coordination continues to improve into his or her late teens. The problem is not with the hand, but the eye. As one's left brain fills up with knowledge, one's seeing ability decreases. As the brain is forced to economize its inputs, it… ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=714))

- Ignorance of the development of the right hemisphere in the lower grades is a sin of missed opportunities. However, by the time the bias of our educational system has reached the graduate level, most students suffer from an almost permanent form of brain damage, "analexia." This ailment is a condition in which the student is able to recognize only what can be counted and analyzed. In most cases this condition has the side effect of an atrophied right brain.

- There were other reasons why Du Pont was playing a loser's game. With 25,000 professional managers in their employ, Du Pont certainly had spent many man-hours studying the energy area, after the 1973 embargo made energy an important subject. They more than likely consulted with the leading experts on energy. Unfortunately for Du Pont, it is axiomatic that just before a trend changes, there will be maximum agreement by experts and others that the trend will not end! By relying on analytically derived forecasts of the left brain, the right-brained sensing becomes overpowered. If he could, Lao Tsu would interject that Du Pont, by consulting men of knowledge, ended up with the wrong feel of reality for their decision-makers. Their regression analysis and economic models of the price of oil caused them to mistake the symbol for reality. In turn, a false sense of security was created when man once again preferred the artificial and complicated to the simple ways of nature.

- Man is extremely uncomfortable with uncertainty. To deal with his discomfort, man tends to create a false sense of security by substituting certainty for uncertainty. It becomes the herd instinct. The irony is that the greater the uncertainty, the greater the similarity of predictions, as the experts "shout together in the dark." In turn, the greater will be the collective surprise when their predictions miss the mark. The less information there is available about reality, oftentimes the more uniform the "conventional wisdom" will be. It is amazing how easily people's opinions are drawn together under conditions of uncertainty. Sadly, many businessmen, despite having made disastrous decisions by following the conventional wisdom, retain their jobs because their files are stuffed with research reports ("How could you expect me to disagree with the 'world's smartest men'?"), and because almost everyone else was wrong as well. And so it goes, as the experts continue to substitute certainty for uncertainty and thus become the losers in the forecasting game.

- As Lao Tsu said, "Certain ends are best accomplished without the use of conscious means." Tim Gallwey made the same discovery and shared his insights with readers in his book The Inner Game of Tennis. Gallwey's inspiration for his famous book first developed when he observed a player talking to himself on the tennis court as if there were two people in one body. After further observations, Gallwey concluded that the conscious mind of many players constantly blamed the unconscious mind for a poor performance. He further observed that the more a player berated himself, the more his natural flow was affected and the worse he played. Gallwey described one incident where he was giving lessons to a group of novice players. In giving them a drill for net play, he asked them to concentrate on their footwork as they returned the shots he hit to them. After the drill, he commented on how well they had done, pointing out that the balls they had hit were clustered in the rear corners of the court, just where they should be. He then asked the group to repeat the drill and again to concentrate on their footwork. The results of this exercise were quite different, as the balls were scattered all over the court, many of them not clearing the net. In the second drill, the students' conscious minds, thinking shot placement, had interfered with their natural flow. Though Gallwey does not refer directly to the left and right brains in his book, the dual mentality of tennis players is the book's primary focus. By trying to overpower the nonverbal right hemisphere, whose natural province is spatial relationships, players often let the wrong mind dominate the task. The expression "playing out of one's mind" in effect refers to play where the logical, verbal mind is stilled so that the right hemisphere can be in control. (Note: In jogging, that "runner's high" occurs when the blood flow first switches in greater proportion to the right brain, usually ten minutes after starting.) In like fashion, those who can verbalize the techniques and methodologies of a sport tend to be those whose play is least skillful. As Lao Tsu observed, "The man who struggles to carve a piece of jade will mar it, but if he lets his hands guide themselves, the work is easy and perfect."

- By relying too much on MBAs and other technocrats, Wall Street and corporate America have tipped the managerial balance heavily toward the left brain. As a result, they are playing a loser's game; they are relying on the wrong brain hemisphere for the task of understanding a changing world. Sure, the left brain, like the "world's smartest man," thinks it can do the job, with its theoretical rankings, its sophisticated models that project the past into the future, and its verbal skills to convince us of its infallibility. But it constantly plays the loser's game by trying to make fixity out of flux. As John Maynard Keynes said, "Nothing is more suicidal than a rational investment policy in an irrational world."

- This tendency of the West to "execute" events that do not fit its dominant belief system (i.e., to pick out only the information that fits one's predetermined viewpoint) is dangerous, as it denies possible clues that change may be occurring. As Einstein said, "Theory shapes the observation." Therefore, the common expression "seeing is believing" is perhaps one of the West's most inaccurate platitudes. In reality, we are much more likely to see what we believe. As Shakespeare's Macbeth asked, "Are my eyes but fools for my other senses?" Most of our personal, business, and investment problems are not caused because we lack intelligence or are lazy. Rather, the most common cause of failure is that we fail to see and/or otherwise ignore the numerous yellow and red warning signals that are waved before our eyes. Why do we so often miss them? One reason is that the warning signals are but one of many information inputs vying for our attention. Sociologists calculate that Western man receives 65,000 more stimuli per day than his forebears did one hundred years ago. Investment research reports piled high on the desks of professional investment managers attest to the now-famous overload of information. Another reason why we see reality so poorly, and so often miss the warning signs, is that our logical left hemisphere interferes with the seeing abilities of the right brain. The following tests are provided to demonstrate this point. The "F" Test Read carefully the sentence below and count the number of f's in the sentence. Reread it again, carefully: Did you find all six f's? If not, don't be surprised, as only 15 percent of those who take this test get the correct answer. If you counted less than six (most count three), read the same sentence below as it is written backward: By now you have probably realized that you missed the f's in the "of's." Why? Your error was not that you did not see the f's in the of's (you did), but that you failed to count them. Since "of" is phonetically "ov," the verbal left hemisphere, by taking the verbal clue, overrode the right, "seeing" hemisphere and thus forced the wrong conclusion.

- Another visual test is provided in the three-letter word below. Can you read what the word is? If you are having trouble seeing the above word (it is a negative space lettering), try the more filled-in version below. In order to extrapolate what is missing, you need to use the right hemisphere, as it is by far the one best suited to deal with incomplete information. Most of us, however, try to use our left brains to recognize what is familiar; we are employing the wrong brain half for the task. To further test your perception, try this "bookworm" test: Bookworm Problem While this problem looks deceptively simple, it is actually quite difficult. As a matter of fact, only about one person in ten is able to solve it the first time around. There are four volumes of Shakespeare's collected works on the shelf. The pages of each volume are exactly 2" thick. The covers are each 1/6" thick. The bookworm started eating at page 1 of volume I and ate through to the last page of volume IV. What is the distance the bookworm covered? Despite the fact that once you see the answer it is obvious, few persons who take this test get it correct the first time. The left brain is so anxious to get into its mathematical calculations that it pushes aside the initial visual task that the right hemisphere has to perform in order to correctly solve the problem. Positive of its calculations, the left brain volunteers the answer and in the process forces a "half-brained" conclusion. It fails to "see" that the order of the books is different for the worm than it would be for a reader. To read from the first page to the last would mean reading all four volumes, but the bookworm has only to eat through two volumes (including the covers). Such an example is illustrative of our Western tendency to carelessness in challenging assumptions. We tend to miss the big picture by jumping too quickly to the details. If the ship's captain in the cartoon survives his impending problem, he might well agree with Lao Tsu's blunt quote, "How stupid to waste our lives in infinite details!" Well-known psychologist Jerome Bruner conducted an interesting visual test in which he flashed pictures of playing cards on a screen and asked his audience to identify them. After a while, he mixed in with the ordinary cards a red ace of spades, a black five of diamonds, etc. Rather than spot the anomalous cards, the observers would "correct them" in their minds and improperly report a black ace of spades or a red five of diamonds. The fact that the subjects' assumptions limited their ability to see reality shows once again how we tend to ignore our sensory input when it does not fit our dominant beliefs.

Furthermore, the harder he would look at the blue sky, the more he would classify night people as "crazies." As Ornstein states, "If an object or sensory input appears which does not fit our categories, we tend to ignore it. Therefore, it is difficult to alter our assumptions even in the face of compelling new evidence." We fail to realize that our consciousness is merely our best guess about reality. The following Taoist story illustrates how one's assumptions affect perception: Once upon a time a man whose axe was missing, suspected his neighbor's son.

- Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain Dr. Betty Edwards's best-selling book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, is revolutionizing the way that art is being taught. In her six-week drawing course, the improvement of her students is not gradual, but dramatic. Her techniques for teaching art serve to turn off the overactive left hemisphere. She points out that the left brain interferes with perception because of its simplistic certainty that, if it can name and categorize something, it need not look carefully. Edwards points out that most children lose their capacity for drawing past the age of nine or ten as they get little help from overly busy teachers who are intent on the three R's. Since a child's hand-eye coordination continues to improve until the age of fifteen or sixteen, it is the student's ability to see reality that is not being developed. Dr. Edwards describes how art can still the chatter of the verbal brain, to enter the realm of relationships, meaningfulness, and wholeness. In short, she discusses art as a discovery process to achieve greater self-awareness. As Lao Tsu would add, "The more stuffed the mind is with knowledge, the less able one can see what's in front of him." One of Betty Edwards's instructional drawing exercises is to draw a picture upside… ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FKZN4W6&location=1071))
