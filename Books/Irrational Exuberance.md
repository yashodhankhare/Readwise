## Highlights
- Although the book originally focused directly on current economic ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=122))
- events, it was, and is, about how errors of human judgment can infect even the smartest people, thanks to overconfidence, lack of attention to details, and excessive trust in the judgments of others, stemming from a failure to understand that ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=122))
- others are not making independent judgments but are themselves following still others—the blind leading the blind. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=124))
- There is an increasing perception that the price of assets matters very much to our lives. People increasingly believe that they must defend their private property and doubt that they can depend on social institutions to save them if things turn ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=164))
- out badly. They see merciless capitalism as the wave of the future. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=166))
- Irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble. I define a speculative bubble as a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=353))
- contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=354))
- envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler's excitement. We will explore the various elements of this definition of a bubble throughout this book. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=356))
- Although interest rates must have some effect on the market, the behavior of the stock market is not just a predictable reaction to interest rates. There is a lot more going on in the stock market, and a lot more for us to try to understand about its behavior. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=486))
- There may well be at least some tendency for home prices to respond to the stock market: a recent Bank of International Settlements study of house prices in ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=584))
- thirteen industrialized countries concluded that peaks in the housing market tend to follow peaks in the stock market with an average lag of about two years.10 ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=585))
- Reflections from casual observation ought to convince us that homes have not appreciated significantly over the decades. People are living in larger homes than they were decades ago and are spread out over more ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=735))
- properties, more people are living in a house by themselves, more children are moving out and starting their own homes rather than living with their parents until marriage.20 How could they afford this if home prices were rising steeply? This ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=736))
- suggests that in the United States real home price growth must have been less than real per capita personal income growth, which was 2.0% a year from 1929 to 2003. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=738))
- The bottom line appears to be that, while there is some uncertainty about the actual path of home prices, most of the evidence points to disappointingly low average rates of real appreciation of most homes.

- actual path of home prices, most of the evidence points to disappointingly low average rates of real appreciation of most homes. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=740))
- The problem is that people in glamorous regions often tend to believe that land prices, already a significant component of home value there, will keep going up and up. Surely, they think, there is some advantage to living in those areas. People do ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=772))
- enjoy the prestige of living in an area where celebrities live, and they also benefit from the business opportunities there. It is easy for residents there to imagine that more and more people are thinking similarly, and that they will continue to bid up real estate prices in ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=774))
- their city. This is irrational exuberance in the context of real estate. But, in reality, if home prices get sufficiently high in a city relative to the income of the people who live there, and thus make it difficult to afford a decent home, people start ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=776))
- taking a hard look at these assumptions. The fact is that the prestige one derives from simply living in a glamorous city is not very significant. And although individual cities may have reputations tied up with specific businesses, with a little imagination one ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=778))
- sees that other centers in the same businesses are constantly being set up, which will eventually cause corporate relocaters to draw population away from older centers to these new centers, thereby relieving upward pressure on real estate prices in the older ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=779))
- centers. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=781))
- Based on these trends, owner-occupied ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=786))
- housing is looking like a bad long-term investment relative to the stock market: despite the occasional volatility of real estate, it has offered practically no capital gains for long-term investors. But one must remember the implicit dividends that one receives from ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=787))
- living in a home, that is, the value of the shelter and other services provided by a home. These dividends are untaxed. It is often said (correctly) that there is a tax advantage to owning rather than renting. If one swapped houses with one's neighbor ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=788))
- living in an identical house and each paid rent to the other (so that the rent received would cancel out the rent paid), the transaction would be virtually meaningless from an economic standpoint, but it would incur taxes, since the rent received would be taxable ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=790))
- while the rent paid would not be deductible. For this reason, most people are well advised to buy rather than rent the homes they live in. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=792))
- Thus there is really no way that one can say authoritatively which has been the better investment historically, homes or stocks. The answer differs across individuals, and is ultimately a matter of taste and circumstance. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=803))
- Unfortunately, tying compensation to the price of stock creates an unhealthy fixation on stock price. With such options—which hold out the promise of substantial wealth if the stock price rises above the exercise price of the options—management has an ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=945))
- incentive to do everything they can to boost share prices. They have an incentive to maintain an appearance of corporate success, an image of the company as working toward a brilliant future. They also have an incentive to undertake corporate initiatives ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=947))
- whenever they think the market will respond to them, even if they themselves are doubtful of the value of these initiatives. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=948))
- What matters for a stock market boom is not, however, the reality of the Internet revolution, which is hard to discern, but rather the public ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1042))
- impressions that the revolution creates. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1043))
- In experimental situations, if people are shown daily data on stock prices they ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1337))
- express much less interest in investing in stocks than if they are shown only longer-run returns. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1337))
- Witnessing the day-to-day noise in stock prices apparently encourages more fear about the inherent risk of investing in stocks. Thus institutional ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1338))
- innovations that encourage viewing the market price more frequently might tend to depress the price level of the market. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1339))
- On the other hand, the increased frequency of reporting of stock prices caused by recent institutional and technological ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1340))
- changes may have just the opposite effect to that observed in the experimental situation crafted by Benartzi and Thaler. In a nonexperimental setting, where people's focus of attention is not controlled by an experimenter, the increased frequency ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1341))
- of price observations may tend to increase the demand for stocks by attracting attention to them. And changing public attention is a critical factor in the valuation of investments, a point that will be elaborated in Chapter 9 ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1343))
- A spillover from gambling to financial volatility may come about because ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1376))
- gambling, and the institutions that promote it, yield an inflated estimate of one's own ultimate potential for good luck, a heightened interest in how one performs compared with others, and a new way to stimulate oneself out of a feeling of boredom or ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1376))
- monotony. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1378))
- The emotional state of investors when ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1616))
- they decide on their investments is no doubt one of the most important factors behind the bull market. Although their emotional state may be in part a consequence of the factors described in the previous chapter, such as the rise of materialistic ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1616))
- sentiment and individualism, it is also amplified by the psychological impact of the increasingly strong uptrend observed in the market. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=1618))
- Two kinds of psychological anchors ([Location 3198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3198))
- will be considered here: quantitative anchors, which themselves give indications for the appropriate levels of the market that some people use as indications of whether the market is over- or under-priced and whether it is a good time to buy, and moral ([Location 3198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3198))
- anchors, which operate by determining the strength of the reason that compels people to buy stocks, a reason that they must weigh against their other uses for the wealth they already have (or could have) invested in the market. ([Location 3200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3200))
- With quantitative anchors, ([Location 3201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3201))
- people are weighing numbers against prices when they decide whether stocks (or other assets) are priced right. With moral anchors, people compare the intuitive or emotional strength of the argument for investing in the market against their wealth and their ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3202))
- perceived need for money to spend now. ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3203))
- It has been shown that people will place larger bets on a coin that has not yet been tossed than on a coin that has already been tossed (and for which the outcome has been concealed). ([Location 3322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=3322))
- Understanding how social forces cause speculative market moves has been the major theme of this book. It is so difficult for most of us to figure out which moves are caused by sensible good reasons and expert opinions and which are caused by human ([Location 4329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4329))
- imagination and social psychology. I hope that the argument to this point has made it clear that, as these major markets go, it is often largely the latter that drives prices. In both the stock market and the housing market, people have only the fuzziest idea what these investments are really worth, what their prices ought to be. They may be able to judge whether one ([Location 4330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4330))
- stock is overpriced relative to another, or whether one house is overpriced relative to another, but they just do not know how to judge the overall level of prices. Much more salient in their minds is the rate of increase of the prices, something that they talk and hear about a lot in a time of rapid price change, and that has subtle effects on their ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4333))
- demand for speculative assets. ([Location 4335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4335))
- As the price increase during a bubble goes on through time, people constantly reassess their opinions. People who thought there was a bubble, and that prices were too high, find themselves questioning their own earlier judgments, and start to wonder if fundamentals are indeed driving the ([Location 4335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4335))
- price increase. Many people seem to think that if the price increase goes on for years after some experts have called the price increase a bubble, then maybe the experts were wrong. And they then feel that there is no alternative to thinking that it is really fundamentals that are driving the increase, and that these fundamentals will go on forever. These ([Location 4337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005CQAJ80&location=4337))
