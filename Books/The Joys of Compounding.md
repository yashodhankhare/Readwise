## Highlights
- More important than the will to win is the will to prepare. —Charlie Munger ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=168))

- One person who took Buffett’s advice, Todd Combs, now works for the legendary investor. After hearing Buffett talk, Combs started keeping track of what he read and how many pages he was reading. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=596))

- If you think of your mind as a library, three things should concern you: 1. The accuracy and relevance of the information you store. 2. Your ability to find or retrieve that information on demand. 3. Your ability to put that information to use when you need it—that is, your ability to apply it. Having a repository of knowledge in your mind is pointless if you can’t find and apply its contents. Here, I am reminded of what Sherlock Holmes said in The Reigate Puzzle: “It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital. Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated.”6 So be very careful of what you take in.

- In Michael Eisner and Aaron Cohen’s book Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed, Buffett talked about his and Munger’s fierce dedication to lifelong learning: I don’t think any other twosome in business was better at continuous learning than we were…. And if we hadn’t been continuous learners, the record wouldn’t have been as good. And we were so extreme about it that we both spent the better part of our days reading, so we could learn more, which is not a common pattern in business…. We don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think.7 ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=635))

- Munger: We’ve learned how to outsmart people who are clearly smarter [than we are]. Buffett: Temperament is more important than IQ. Munger: The other big secret is that we’re good at lifelong learning. Warren is better in his seventies and eighties, in many ways, than he was when he was younger. If you keep learning all the time, you have a wonderful advantage.8 Is there a better investment than self-improvement? Here is what Buffett has had to say on the topic: “The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself.” “The more you learn, the more you’ll earn.” “Learn from your mistakes, and the mistakes of others.”9 Self-improvement is the best way to spend some of your time every day. And finding the time to read is easier than you think. One way to make this happen is to carve out an hour of each day just for yourself. If you need inspiration, consider how Munger would sell himself the best hour of each day. In an interview for his authorized biography, The Snowball, Buffett shared this story about Munger: ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=643))

- Charlie, as a very young lawyer, was probably getting $20 an hour. He thought to himself, “Who’s my most valuable client?” And he decided it was himself. So he decided to sell himself an hour each day. He did it early in the morning, working on these construction projects and real estate deals. Everybody should do this, be the client, and then work for other people, too, and sell yourself an hour a day.10 ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=657))

- After having successfully achieved financial freedom through my passionate pursuit of lifelong learning, I can happily say that I am a better investor because I am a lifelong learner, and I am a better lifelong learner because I am an investor. It seems fitting to end this chapter with the golden words of wisdom from two of the greatest learners and thinkers to have ever lived. An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. —Benjamin Franklin Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day. —Charlie Munger ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=673))

- That sounds funny, making friends among the eminent dead, but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better in life and work better in education. It’s way better than just being given the basic concepts.2 ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=715))

- Morgan Housel writes: Everything’s been done before. The scenes change but the behaviors and outcomes don’t. Historian Niall Ferguson’s plug for his profession is that “The dead outnumber the living 14 to 1, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.” The biggest lesson from the 100 billion people who are no longer alive is that they tried everything we’re trying. The details were different, but they tried to outwit entrenched competition. They swung from optimism to pessimism at the worst times. They battled unsuccessfully against reversion to the mean. They learned that popular things seem safe because so many people are involved, but they’re most dangerous because they’re most competitive. Same stuff that guides today, and will guide tomorrow. History is abused when specific events are used as a guide to the future. It’s way more useful as a benchmark for how people react to risk and incentives, which is pretty stable over time.3 ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=719))

- So, learn from others. Figure out where you are going and find out who has been there before. Knowledge comes from experience, but it doesn’t have to be your experience. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=736))

- The rich have money. The wealthy have control over their time. And time is the scarcest resource, because of its nonrenewability. Time is a universally depleting resource, reduced at the same rate for the wealthy as for the poor. This gives us one way of defining a successful investor, as a person for whom time has become a more binding constraint than money. The ultimate status symbol is time. Time is the new money. My friends and colleagues often ask me how I manage to find so much time for reading while having a full-time job and managing my household chores. For starters, I hardly watch television. I don’t even have a cable television connection. I get all my desired content on Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime. I watch only those select few movies, documentaries, and shows that truly pique my interest. I ensure that I don’t spend a lot of time commuting to my workplace. I live in an area where I can walk to the grocery store, finish my purchases, and return home in less than twenty minutes. I have fully automated the monthly payments online for my phone, electricity, Internet, utilities, and meal plan bills. All these choices are deliberate. If you assume that the average person spends two hours a day watching television, an hour for commuting, and another two hours a week shopping, that adds up to twenty-three hours a week. Twenty-three hours. That is 1,380 minutes. That is a lot of time. If you read a page in two minutes, that’s almost seven hundred pages a week. Do seven hundred pages a week sound like too much for you? Well, how about just twenty-five pages a day? Shane Parrish writes: While most of us don’t have the time to read a whole book in one sitting, we do have the time to read 25 pages a day. Reading the right books, even if it’s a few pages a day, is one of the best ways to ensure that you go to bed a little smarter than you woke up. Twenty-five pages a day doesn’t sound like much, but this commitment adds up over time. Let’s say that two days out of each month, you probably won’t have time to read. Plus Christmas. That gives you 340 days a year of solid reading time. If you read 25 pages a day for 340 days, that’s 8,500 pages. 8,500. What I have also found is that when I commit to a minimum of 25 pages, I almost always read more. So let’s call the 8,500 pages 10,000. (I only need to extend the daily 25 pages into 30 to get there.) With 10,000 pages a year, at a general pace of 25/day, what can we get done? Well, The Power Broker is 1,100 pages. The four LBJ books written by Robert Caro are collectively 3,552 pages. Tolstoy’s two masterpieces—War and Peace, and Anna Karenina—come in at a combined 2,160. Gibbon’s The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is six volumes and runs to about 3,660 pages. That’s 10,472 pages. That means, in about one year, at a modest pace of 25 pages a day, you’d have knocked out 13 masterful works and learned an enormous amount about the history of the world. In one year! That leaves the following… ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=746))

- The point of assigning yourself a certain amount of reading every day is to create a deeply held habit. The 25-pages-a-day thing is a habit-former!… …Read what seems awesome and interesting to you now and let your curiosities grow organically. A lifelong interest in truth, reality, and knowledge will lead you down so many paths, you should never need to force yourself to read anything unless there is a very, very specific reason. (Perhaps to learn a specific skill for a job.) Not only is this approach way more fun, but it works really, really well. It keeps you reading. It keeps you interested. And in the words of Nassim Taleb, “Curiosity is antifragile, like an addiction; magnified by attempts to satisfy it.” Thus, paradoxically, as you read more books, your pile of unread books will get larger, not smaller. That’s because your curiosity will grow with every great read. This is the path of the lifelong learner.5 This is compounding wisdom in action. This is how you become smarter. You must value your time very highly. You’ve got to keep control of your time, and you can’t unless you say no. You can’t let people set your agenda in life.

- Reading alone, however, isn’t enough to improve your knowledge. Learning something insightful requires work. You have to read something above your current level. You need to find writers who are more knowledgeable on a particular subject than you are. This is how you become more intelligent. Reach out to and associate with people better than you and you cannot help but improve. A lot of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding it.

- In my view, studying old newspapers is a far more productive exercise than reading today’s newspaper. (Buffett likes to call it “instructive art.”) Morgan Housel writes: Every piece of financial news you read should be filtered by asking the question, “Will I still care about this in a year? Five years? Ten years?” The goal of information should be to help you make better decisions between now and the end of your ultimate goals. Read old news and you’ll quickly see that the life expectancy of your goals is higher than that of the vast majority of headlines.6 Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes, in his book Fooled by Randomness, “Minimal exposure to the media should be a guiding principle for someone involved in decision making under uncertainty—including all participants in financial markets.”7 His key argument is that what is reported in the media is noise rather than information, but most people do not realize that the media is paid to get our attention.

- Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren have written the seminal book on reading. Their How to Read a Book provides the necessary skills to read anything. Adler and Van Doren identify four levels of reading: elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical. Before we can improve reading skills, we need to understand the differences among these reading levels. They are discussed as levels because you must master one level before you can move to a higher level. They are cumulative, and each level builds on the preceding one. Here is how Adler and Van Doren describe these four levels: 1. Elementary reading. This is the most basic level of reading as taught in our elementary schools. It is when we move from illiteracy to literacy. 2. Inspectional reading. This is another name for “scanning” or “superficial reading.” It means giving a piece of writing a quick yet meaningful advance review to evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience. Whereas the question that is asked at the first level (elementary reading) is “What does the sentence say?” the question typically asked at this level is “What is the book about?” 3. Analytical reading. Analytical reading is a thorough reading. This is the stage at which you make the book your own by conversing with the author and asking many organized questions. Asking a book questions as you read makes you a better reader. But you must do more. You must attempt to answer the questions you are asking. While you could do this in your mind, Adler and Van Doren argue that it’s much easier to do this with a pencil in your hand. “The pencil,” they argue, “becomes the sign of your alertness while you read.” Adler and Van Doren share the many ways to mark a book. They recommend that we underline or circle the main points; draw vertical lines at the margin to emphasize a passage already underlined or too long to be underlined; place a star, asterisk, or other symbol at the margin for emphasis; place numbers in the margin to indicate a sequence of points made in developing an argument; place page numbers of other pages in the margin to remind ourselves where else in the book the author makes the same points; circle keywords or phrases; and write our questions (and perhaps answers) in the margin (or at the top or bottom of the pages). This is how we remember the best ideas out of the books we read, long after we have read them—by making a book our own through asking questions and seeking answers within it. As Cicero said, “Nothing so much assists learning as writing down what we wish to remember.” 4. Syntopical reading. Thus far, we have been learning about how to read a book. The highest level of reading, syntopical reading, allows you to synthesize knowledge from a comparative reading of several books about the same subject. This is where the real virtue of reading is actualized. Syntopical reading, also known as comparative reading, involves reading many books on the same subject and then comparing and contrasting… ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=860))

- In a 2017 interview, AngelList cofounder and CEO Naval Ravikant said, “I don’t know about you, but I have very poor attention. I skim. I speed read. I jump around. I could not tell you specific passages or quotes from books. At some deep level, you do absorb them and they become part of the threads of the tapestry of your psyche [emphasis added].” It is this development of the “tapestry of the psyche” that really matters a lot in becoming a wiser person over time. How can we develop the same? By starting early and taking advantage of the Matthew effect. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=902))

- Imagine that you and Buffett are reading the latest issue of The Economist magazine. Who do you think will end up with greater insight at the end of this reading session? The answer is obvious, isn’t it? And for good reason. Buffett is eighty-nine years old and, even at this age, he continues to be a relentless learning machine. He not only started learning early but also has been accumulating knowledge for more than three-quarters of a century. The Matthew effect, in this context, refers to a person who has more expertise and thus has a larger knowledge base. This larger knowledge base allows that person to acquire greater expertise at a faster rate. So, the amount of useful insight that Buffett can draw from the same reading material would be quite high compared with most any other person, and again, Buffett would end up becoming smarter at a faster rate. As you read increasingly more, your capacity to read and absorb more knowledge increases rapidly. During the initial days of inculcating my reading habit, I found it difficult to grasp the deep significance of many of the concepts in the books I read. Gradually, over time, I started discovering connections between the ideas that spread across different books. It is these connections that lead to the development of the “tapestry of the psyche,” which in turn deepens our understanding of the big ideas coming from the key disciplines. This deep understanding makes the brain more efficient and smarter and better able to make sense of new information. None of us can know everything, but we can work to understand the big important models at a basic level across a broad range of disciplines so they can collectively add value in the decision-making process. Deep reading of the fundamentals enables us to understand the world for what it is. This is how we learn to reason from first principles.

- When Jeff Bezos started Amazon.com, in 1995, he clearly identified the first principles that would guide his business philosophy—that is, long-term thinking and a relentless focus on the customer rather than on the competition.

- Nassim Taleb calls this “subtractive epistemology.” He argues that the greatest contribution to knowledge consists of removing what we think is wrong. We know a lot more about what is wrong than what is right. What does not work (i.e., negative knowledge) is more robust than positive knowledge. This is because it is a lot easier for something we know to fail than it is for something we know isn’t so to succeed. Taleb dubs this philosophy “via negativa,” employing a Latin phrase used in Christian theology to explain a way of describing God by focusing on what he is not, rather than on what he is. The absence of evidence doesn’t qualify as the evidence of absence. In other words, just because all of the swans that have been observed to date are white, doesn’t prove that all swans are white. One small observation (i.e., spotting a black swan) can conclusively disprove the statement “all swans are white” but millions of observations can hardly confirm it. Thus, disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. Elon Musk once referred to knowledge as a semantic tree: “Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.”12 When you want to learn a new subject, first identify the fundamental principles and learn those in a clear and deep manner. Is there a way for us to do this effectively? It turns out that, indeed, a simple way to do this exists. It’s simple but not easy.

- To apply first principles thinking to the field of value investing, consider several fundamental truths. Understand and practice the following if you want to become a good investor: 1. Look at stocks as part ownership of a business. 2. Look at Mr. Market—volatile stock price fluctuations—as your friend rather than your enemy. View risk as the possibility of permanent loss of purchasing power, and uncertainty as the unpredictability regarding the degree of variability in the possible range of outcomes.

- Remember the three most important words in investing: “margin of safety.” 4. Evaluate any news item or event only in terms of its impact on (a) future interest rates and (b) the intrinsic value of the business, which is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out during its remaining life, adjusted for the uncertainty around receiving those cash flows. 5. Think in terms of opportunity costs when evaluating new ideas and keep a very high hurdle rate for incoming investments. Be unreasonable. When you look at a business and get a strong desire from within saying, “I wish I owned this business,” that is the kind of business in which you should be investing. A great investment idea doesn’t need hours to analyze. More often than not, it is love at first sight. 6. Think probabilistically rather than deterministically, because the future is never certain and it is really a set of branching probability streams. At the same time, avoid the risk of ruin, when making decisions, by focusing on consequences rather than just on raw probabilities in isolation. Some risks are just not worth taking, whatever the potential upside may be. 7. Never underestimate the power of incentives in any given situation. 8. When making decisions, involve both the left side of your brain (logic, analysis, and math) and the right side (intuition, creativity, and emotions).

- Engage in visual thinking, which helps us to better understand complex information, organize our thoughts, and improve our ability to think and communicate. 10. Invert, always invert. You can avoid a lot of pain by visualizing your life after you have lost a lot of money trading or speculating using derivatives or leverage. If the visuals unnerve you, don’t do anything that could get you remotely close to reaching such a situation. 11. Vicariously learn from others throughout life. Embrace everlasting humility to succeed in this endeavor. 12. Embrace the power of long-term compounding. All the great things in life come from compound interest. In addition to these fundamental truths, the value investing discipline has certain finer aspects that we come to realize and appreciate only with the passage of time and with experience: Knowledge is overrated.

- Robert Hagstrom wrote a wonderful book on worldly wisdom entitled Investing: The Last Liberal Art, in which he states that “each discipline entwines with, and in the process strengthens, every other. From each discipline the thoughtful person draws significant mental models, the key ideas that combine to produce a cohesive understanding. Those who cultivate this broad view are well on their way to achieving worldly wisdom.”3 ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1074))

- When Munger was asked at the 2017 Daily Journal Corporation meeting whether one should become a polymath or a specialist, his answer surprised a lot of people. Many people in the audience expected the answer to be obvious—of course he would recommend that people become generalists. But this is not what Munger said. I don’t think operating over many disciplines, as I do, is a good idea for most people. I think it’s fun, that’s why I’ve done it. And I’m better at it than most people would be, and I don’t think I’m good at being the very best at handling differential equations. So, it’s been a wonderful path for me, but I think the correct path for everybody else is to specialize and get very good at something that society rewards, and then to get very efficient at doing it. But even if you do that, I think you should spend 10 to 20 percent of your time [on] trying to know all the big ideas in all the other disciplines [emphasis added].4 ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1093))

- What crosses most of history? Peter Kaufman, CEO of Glenair, board member of the Daily Journal Corporation, and editor of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, has shared the answer in his “three-bucket” framework: Every statistician knows that a large, relevant sample size is their best friend. What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles? Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It’s all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior. Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.6 ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1114))

- If we are to improve our learning, we should focus on things that change slowly. Kaufman’s approach provides a framework of general laws that have stood the test of time—invariant, unchanging lenses that we can use to focus and arrive at workable answers. A foundational principle that aligns with the world and is applicable across the geologic time scale of human, organic, and inorganic history is compounding. Compounding is one of the most powerful forces in the world. In fact, it is the only power law in the universe that exists with a variable in its exponent. The power law of compounding not only is applicable to investing but also, and more important, can be applied to continued learning. The fastest way to simplify things is to spot the symmetries, or invariances—that is, the fundamental properties that do not change from one object under study to another. Munger explains: The models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control—at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineers—is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal… And, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea of breakpoints—that’s a very powerful model, too. The notion of a critical mass—that comes out of physics—is a very powerful model.7 But learning the big ideas from the key disciplines is not enough. We need to understand how these ideas interact and combine with each other, because this is what leads to “lollapalooza effects.” Munger explains: You get lollapalooza effects when two, three or four forces are all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don’t get simple addition. It’s often like critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to a certain point of mass—and you don’t get anything much worth seeing if you don’t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a break point or critical mass basis… More commonly, the forces coming out of…models are conflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable trade-offs. …You have to realize the truth of biologist Julian Huxley’s idea that “Life is just one damn relatedness after another.” So you must have the models, and you must see the relatedness and the effects from the relatedness.8 Commenting on Munger, Bill Gates once said, “He is truly the broadest thinker I have ever encountered.”9 Warren Buffett has said that Munger has “the best thirty-second mind in the world. He goes from A to Z in one move. He sees the essence of everything before you even finish the sentence.”10 How is Munger able to do this?

- We can improve our thinking process by taking out and devoting the necessary time for it. According to Tren Griffin, Munger’s breadth of knowledge is something that is naturally part of his character but also something that he intentionally cultivates. In his view, to know nothing about an important subject is to invite problems. Both Munger and Buffett set aside plenty of time each day to just think. Anyone reading the news is provided with constant reminders of the consequences of not thinking. Thinking is a surprisingly underrated activity. Researchers published a study in 2014 that revealed that approximately a quarter of women and two-thirds of men chose electric shocks over spending time alone with their own thoughts.11 Bertrand Russell rightly said, “Most people would rather die than think, and many of them do.” ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1160))

- Look at this generation, with all of its electronic devices and multitasking. I will confidently predict less success than Warren, who just focused on reading. If you want wisdom, you’ll get it sitting on your ass. That’s the way it comes. —Charlie Munger Munger has often credited his success to having a long attention span, that is, his ability to stay focused for an extended period of time. Munger is able to block out the world when he is thinking, which has provided him a great advantage in solving problems and developing ideas. Long attention spans allow for a deep understanding of subjects. When combined with deliberate practice, it helps us identify our leverage points and focus our energies on them. As you can see, actual thinking is really hard work. It is why Henry Ford said, “Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably why so few people engage in it.” The best ideas come to you in solitude. Introverts tend to be creative because, by spending more time alone, they are more susceptible to inspiration. Introverts are less susceptible to groupthink, and thus it is easier for them to go against the consensus. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1181))

- Brilliant people aren’t a special breed—they just use their minds differently. They practice certain habits of thinking that allow them to see the world differently from others. In their book The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, Dr. Edward B. Burger and Dr. Michael Starbird outline some practical ways for us to improve our thinking:13 1. Understand deeply. When you learn anything, go for depth and make it rock solid. Any concept that you are trying to master is a combination of simple core ideas. Identify the core ideas and learn them deeply. This deeply ingrained knowledge base can serve as a meaningful springboard for more advanced learning and action in your field. Be brutally honest with yourself. If you do not understand something, revisit the core concepts again and again. Remember that merely memorizing stuff is not deep learning. 2. Make mistakes. Mistakes highlight unforeseen opportunities as well as gaps in our understanding. And mistakes are great teachers. As Michael Jordan once said, “I’ve missed more than nine thousand shots in my career. I’ve lost almost three hundred games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” The takeaway is that we cannot come out with a correct solution on the first attempt. Start with a probable solution (hypothesis) and continue correcting the mistakes until you arrive at the right solution. Thomas Edison was famous for using this approach for his inventions. When he said that invention is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration, the perspiration was the process of incrementally making mistakes and learning from them to make the next attempts apt to be closer to right. When Edison was asked how he felt about his countless failed attempts at making a light bulb, he replied, “I have not failed. I’ve just found ten thousand ways that won’t work.” 3. Raise questions. If you want to deepen your understanding, you need to raise questions. Do not be afraid to show your ignorance. If you do not understand, ask. The great philosopher Socrates would challenge his students, friends, and even enemies to make new discoveries by asking them uncomfortable, core questions, which often led to new insights. 4. Follow the flow of ideas. To truly understand a concept, discover how it evolved from simpler concepts. Recognizing that the present reality is a moment in a continuing evolution makes your understanding fit into a more coherent structure. You cannot discover everything on your own. You need to use the existing idea and improve it. Edison was supremely successful at inventing product after product, exploiting the maxim that every new idea has utility beyond its original intent. He is credited with having said, “I start where the last man left off.” More poignantly, he noted that “many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.” 5.… ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=1191))

- According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—a reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the world’s longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happy life. Having a strong sense of ikigai—where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersect—means that each day is infused with meaning. Although there is no direct English translation, the word ikigai is thought to combine the Japanese words ikiru, meaning “to live,” and kai, meaning “the realization of what one hopes for.” Together these definitions create the concept of “a reason to live,” or the idea of having a purpose in life (figure 4.1).

- Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart… [emphasis added]. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition [emphasis added]. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

- Every big decision we make in life usually involves some sort of a trade-off. At times, we have to accept small regrets to avoid large ones later. Many people spend so much time worrying about the risks of taking action that they completely overlook the risks of failing to act. Sure, if you don’t take any risk, there’s no failure associated. No pain. No pain? Really? Regrets will haunt you for the rest of your life. Failure hurts but passes quickly. Conversely, regret hurts forever. It’s hard to look back and face the opportunities missed because of a lack of initiative. Failure doesn’t hurt as much as witnessing how fear led us to mistrust our intuition. You only need to succeed once to unlock a new world of possibilities. Regret is in the nondoing. Many people are experts at success, but amateurs at failure.

- The framework I found, which made the decision incredibly easy, was what I called—which only a nerd would call—a “regret minimization framework.” So I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, “Okay, now I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.” I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried [emphasis added]. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision.9 ([Location 2261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=2261))

- Following are some of the key elements of deliberate practice: 1. It’s repeatable. If you’re a writer, you write a lot. If you are a musician, you know the importance of repeating your notes. 2. It receives constant feedback. Learning occurs when you get lots of feedback tied closely in time to decisions and actions. And deliberate practice constantly refers to results-based feedback. No mistakes go unnoticed. In fact, every error is a crucial piece of information for further improvement. The feedback can come from your observations or from a coach or mentor who notices the things that aren’t always visible to you. 3. It is hard. Deliberate practice takes significant mental effort. 4. It isn’t much fun. Most people don’t enjoy doing activities that they’re not good at. It’s no fun to fail time and time again and to receive criticism about how to improve. Yet deliberate practice is designed to focus specifically on those things you are weak at, and this requires you to practice those skills repeatedly until you master them.

Chapter 8 of Graham’s book talks about not letting the mood swings of Mr. Market coax us into speculating, selling in panic, or trying to time the market. Chapter 20 explains that, after careful analysis of a company’s ongoing business and its prospects for future earnings, we should consider buying only if its current price implies a large margin of safety.

- For example, I ask four inverted questions whenever I am looking at a stock. These questions break the mind-set of trying to find supportive bullish reasons and force me to actively seek out disconfirming evidence. 1. How can I lose money? versus How can I make money? If you focus on preventing the downside, the upside takes care of itself. 2. What is this stock not worth? versus What is this stock going to be worth? If you can identify the floor price or a cheap price for a stock, it’s far easier to make profitable decisions. 3. What can go wrong? versus What growth drivers are there? Rather than focusing just on the growth catalysts, think probabilistically, in terms of a range of possible outcomes, and contemplate the possible risks, especially those that have never occurred. 4. What is the growth rate being implied by the market in the current valuation of the stock? versus What is my future growth rate assumption? A reverse discounted cash flow fleshes out the current assumptions of the market for the stock.

- Good investors demonstrate the flexibility to completely change their opinions if necessitated by the facts. They don’t hope they will be right; they keep evaluating why they might be wrong. A good source for disconfirming evidence (from which I have greatly benefited) is the analysis provided by vigilante investors on social media. These investors tend to express bearish or skeptical commentary on almost every single company they review. Another useful source for disconfirming evidence is short-seller or negative reports on the stocks I am contemplating buying or those on which I am bullish. Seth Klarman has spoken in the past about the benefit of this source of information: From our experience, much long-oriented analysis is simplistic, highly optimistic, and sloppy. Short-sellers, by going against the long-term tide of economic growth and the short-term swells of public opinion and margins calls, are forced to be crackerjack analysts. Their work product is usually top-notch and needs to be. Short-sellers shouldn’t be reviled or banned; most should be celebrated and encouraged. They are the policemen of the financial markets, identifying frauds and cautioning against bubbles. In effect, they protect the unsophisticated from predatory schemes that regulators and enforcement agencies don’t seem able to prevent.16 ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=2990))

They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of losses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their solvency.

What are fiduciary duties? You must treat every dollar of client money as though it were the fruit of your own parents’ labor, saved up piece by piece over a lifetime of diligence and thrift. Even if it’s not much, it took years of struggle and sacrifice to accumulate. If you can understand the responsibility this entails, then you can start to understand the meaning of fiduciary duty.

- Long-term investors look for management teams that are willing to defer gratification. These teams are focused on building a durable economic franchise. They are focused on the longevity of the business. They are willing to forgo near-term earnings to increase long-term value. Let’s look at the compound interest formula and view it in a way that helps us think about building long-term value: where a = accumulated future value, p = principal or present value, r = rate of return in percentage terms, and n = number of compounding periods. All too often, management teams focus on the r variable in this equation. They seek instant gratification, with high profit margins and high growth in reported earnings per share (EPS) in the near term, as opposed to initiatives that would lead to a much more valuable business many years down the line. This causes many management teams to pass on investments that would create long-term ([Location 3459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=3459))

- value but would cause “accounting numbers” to look bad in the short term. Pressure from analysts can inadvertently incentivize companies to make as much money as possible off their present customers to report good quarterly numbers, instead of offering a fair price that creates enduring goodwill and a long-term win–win relationship for all stakeholders. The businesses that buy commodities and sell brands and have strong pricing power (typically depicted by high gross margins) should always remember that possessing pricing power is like having access to a large amount of credit. You may have it in abundance, but you must use it sparingly. Having pricing power doesn’t mean you exercise it right away. Consumer surplus is a great strategy, especially for subscription-based business models in which management should primarily focus on habit formation and making renewals a no-brainer. Most businesses fail to appreciate this delicate trade-off between high short-term profitability and the longevity accorded to the business through disciplined pricing and offering great customer value. The few businesses that do understand this trade-off always display “pain today, gain tomorrow” thinking in their daily decisions.

- Let’s look at two contrasting examples. On one hand, we have Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which buys lifesaving drugs for rare diseases from innovative companies but then resorts to predatory pricing. The financial metrics might appear attractive, but a parasitic relationship of extracting value from customers (rather than adding value to them) usually ends up destroying shareholder value at some point in the future. On the other, we have companies like Amazon, led by Jeff Bezos, who says, “We’ve done price elasticity studies, and the answer is always that we should raise prices. We don’t do that, because we believe—and we have to take this as an article of faith—that by keeping our prices very, very low, we earn trust with customers over time, and that that actually does maximize free cash flow over the long term [emphasis added].”3 Some companies are willing to look past maximizing short-run focused r and instead focus on maximizing long-term focused n to create maximum long-term stakeholder value and happy customers. Amazon, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Costco, and GEICO are prominent examples. As they have grown larger over time and have achieved economies of scale, they have continued to share those benefits with customers in the form of lower prices and to provide more value for their customers. This not only makes for delighted customers, who then spend more money with those companies, but also makes those businesses harder to compete with over time, because they have the rare ability to defer gratification in lieu of long-term benefits. Consider the following quotes from Bezos that reflect the culture of long-term thinking at Amazon: A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it’s durable in time—with the potential to endure for decades [emphasis added].

- Investors generally overlook businesses that are doing things that will create significant incremental earnings one to two years from now because they don’t want to wait that far out. Investors often shun businesses that are investing for the future and currently are suffering from low initial margins in those new initiatives (because capacity gets utilized only over time) because the earnings growth is back-ended. Even if they execute well, they will see little “reported” earnings growth for the next four to eight quarters and may even see a decline resulting from incremental depreciation and poor initial margins (because of low capacity utilization). Even if they are expected to experience an exponential jump in earnings growth after that, the stock markets generally do not initially increase the market value of these businesses. They do re-rate them, however, around the time when the earnings growth is clearly visible. As investors, we get an edge over competition if we pick these companies and have the patience and conviction to hold them. Although these businesses are clearly undervalued on a longer-term basis, it is psychologically challenging to invest in them and even more so to hold on to them. These difficulties result in a lack of investors and the subsequent mispricing of these stocks, because the price discovery is weak when investors’ attention on these stocks is low. Capitalizing on businesses that operate on a long-term timeline of value creation is possible only if we operate with a long-term view as well. When you focus on long-term outcomes, expect to be frequently misunderstood in the short term. This is true not only in business and investing but in life and relationships as well. To invest in companies with “the capacity to suffer,” we must be willing to suffer along with them. In other words, we need a high tolerance for short-term pain.

- We should judge our businesses based on their operating results, not on the volatility of their stock prices. The stock market is focused on the latter, but investing success is based on the former. If the management team executes, the stock eventually follows. In fact, not getting immediate returns on our existing high-quality growth stocks builds antifragility. Patience plays a critical role during such times. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has delivered a CAGR of ~21% over the past 42 years (as of October 2019). But if you bought it in 1997, you would have had to wait five years before you saw any positive return on the stock. Similarly, investors in Adobe (which, as of October 2019, has delivered a CAGR of ~24% since its IPO in August 1986) had to undergo a period of thirteen years (2000–2013) during which they made nil return on its stock. Investing is hard. Very hard. It pays to have a long-term view. But a long-term investment horizon must be married with an investment process willing to continually question the core investment thesis. Investors should exercise active patience, that is, diligently verifying their original investment thesis and doing nothing until something materially adverse or negative emerges. All too often, when a stock doesn’t work out as planned, we call it a “long-term investment.” When we spend a lot of time getting to know a business and its management team before investing, as we investors often do, it becomes difficult to change our mind. Investors don’t want to feel like all that time was wasted learning things that they didn’t act upon. We gain an advantage over time by staying intellectually honest while studying new ideas and existing holdings, and only investing in the few in which we think the odds are significantly in our favor. Investors tend to become complacent and stop questioning their existing holdings when their stock prices are going up. They resume analyzing in detail only when the prices start falling. Don’t analyze your holdings only when they fall. Just because the stock price of an existing holding is going up doesn’t necessarily mean that nothing negative is happening in its business.

- An investor who can hold on in the face of all of the advice and temptations to ensure a profit by selling an existing position demonstrates a quality of mind quite out of the ordinary. Embracing deferred gratification is what leads to the single biggest edge for an investor. Human nature makes it difficult to utilize this edge. This difficulty is the very reason the edge exists, and because human nature will never change, this edge is a durable one for those who possess the right temperament to capitalize on it. Bezos referred to the source of this edge when he said, “If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people. But if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue.”14 The ability to have a long-term orientation is now a bigger advantage than ever before. Fifty years ago, the average holding period for stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was seven years. Today it is barely four months. The short-term mind-set that is all-pervasive in the market creates irrational buying and selling for all sorts of reasons that have everything to do with the short-term direction of the stock but nothing to do with the long-term value of the business. Because the financial community has an ever-increasing focus on the next quarter, a long-term orientation is a structural competitive advantage for an investor, and one that is likely to strengthen over time as we experience information, data, and noise overload driven by technological innovations and social media. The very fact that most of the talent and resources on Wall Street are focused on competing in the short-term arena of the next few quarters is what leads to a big opportunity for those who can look three to five years out and quietly consider the bigger picture. Such a long-term orientation helps identify the few key variables that really matter, and those variables are rarely (if ever) the consensus estimates for next quarter’s EPS or the decimal point accuracy of the reported margins. Capitalizing on others’ desire to avoid volatility is what makes this strategy work. Clients tend to demand constant success and have little patience for short-term underperformance, and this means that fund managers risk losing both assets under management and their jobs (also known as “career risk”) if they do not intensely focus on the next month, quarter, or perhaps year at the most. Such clients obviously don’t understand that the only three types of investment performance are bad, net good but occasionally bad, and always good but fraudulent.

- Companies that are focused on stewarding investor capital tend to deliver superior returns over time. Rittenhouse writes, “As an investor, your goal is to find businesses which are run by leaders who steward capital and are accountable for their words and actions. Capital Stewardship reveals whether a CEO’s actions are based on attitudes of being entrusted with or entitled to investor capital.” To check for the presence of capital stewardship, look for clues related to the following topics in shareholder letters, annual reports, and other executive communications: •   Capital discipline. CEOs who are good capital allocators typically offer commentary about returns on investment, on invested capital, and on assets. The strength or weakness of a CEO’s capital discipline is expressed in the commentary about book value or market value. Ask these questions while reading the annual report commentary: Is capital allocation discussed explicitly and rationally? Are words consistent with actions? Are actions and words consistent over time? •   Cash flow. Recurring cash flows are crucial for long-term sustainability of a business. This is why many investors like to invest in stocks of small-ticket consumer nondurables, which are purchased almost as a matter of habit and whose consumption cannot be indefinitely delayed. (For this very reason, within cyclical industries, consumable-oriented businesses enjoy higher valuations than capex-oriented ones, which have a long replacement cycle.) Given its importance, investors might expect every shareholder letter to include commentary on operating and free cash flow. But most letters fail to report on this aspect. Look for CEOs who place a great deal of emphasis on cash flows and communicate about it in a clear manner. Also look at a company’s balance sheet and cash flow statement to see whether the cash flow numbers listed in those financial statements match with the numbers in the CEO’s communication. •   Operating and financial goals. Meaningful financial goal statements indicate that a CEO is serious about efficient capital allocation. Instead of stating goals as platitudes, such as “our goal is to delight all our customers,” effective CEOs provide meaningful context around quantifiable goal statements. Ask yourself: What are the CEO’s incentives? How does the CEO get paid? Is there a return-on-investment component? Look for CEOs and insiders who have low salaries and high stock ownership, as they get rich only when shareholders get rich.

They do not try to spell out everything and they provide reminders of only the critical and most important steps. •   Bad checklists are vague, imprecise, too long, hard to use, and try to spell out every single step. •   Checklists should be confirmed: perform jobs/tasks from memory and experience, but then stop, run the checklist, and confirm that everything was done correctly. •   Checklists should be reviewed: carry out tasks as they are checked off. •   Checklists should include some deal-breaker questions as well as other questions that may require trade-offs.

So he rifles through and as soon as you hit one of those it’s done. Doesn’t like the CEO, forget it. Too much tail risk, forget it. Low-margin business, forget it.

- In other words, our minds are drawn to what feels true, not to what is necessarily so. Every time we pull out a piece of information from memory, we get back a summary that has a lot of missing details. To comprehend that piece of memory, our brain regenerates some part of it on the fly by imaginatively filling in the missing details with stuff that seems plausible, whether or not it actually happened. This reconstruction of any piece of memory happens not just once but every time we access it. When we remember something, we are simply pulling up a number of false details. Maybe we are even adding new errors with each act of recall. The presence of this feedback loop in memory reconsolidation compounds the problem over time. We tend to remember the things we want to remember and forget the things we would rather forget. As a result, a significant part of our memories is self-distorted fiction. Making effective decisions is a complicated affair, but that is our primary task as investors. Our job is to make decisions. And yet very few of us think about how we engage in decision-making. Confusing actual experience with a false memory of it can be a big deterrent to learning from our past investing outcomes. And if we are not learning effectively from our past experiences, we cannot improve our process to make better decisions. Because of narrative fallacy, hindsight bias, and imperfect memory, it is almost impossible to recall with 100 percent accuracy the reasons why we made a particular decision in the past. Our brain fools us by presenting a distorted picture of the circumstances under which we made the decision, which leads to the wrong conclusion about why a stock turned out to be a mistake or a success. We often struggle to improve our decision-making skills because we rarely receive feedback on the quality of our decisions. Good decisions do not guarantee success, but bad ones almost always lead to failure. The way to test the quality of our decisions is to test the process by which we make them. There is a simple way to do this. It’s simple but not easy. Implementing it requires a great deal of humility and intellectual honesty. Carry a notebook and track all of your important decisions. A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking when you made decisions. This feedback helps you realize when you were just plain lucky. Sometimes things work out well for very different reasons than we initially envisaged. The key to understanding the limits to our knowledge is to check the results of our decisions against what we thought was going to happen and why we thought it was going to happen.

- This feedback loop is incredibly important, because the mind won’t provide it on its own. We don’t know as much as we think we know. We are fooled into thinking that we understand something when we do not, and we have no means to correct ourselves. Our minds revise history to preserve our view of ourselves. The story that we tell ourselves conjures up a linear cause-and-effect relationship between a decision we made and the actual outcome. The best cure for this cognitive malfunction is a decision journal. Maintain a journal that contains your original investment thesis at the time you made the purchase as well as the rationale for making the sale. As Robert Heinlein writes, “man is not a rational animal; he is a rationalizing animal.”1 After the fact, everything seems obvious; in hindsight, fundamental analysis of any event can be reconstituted and is always brilliant. A journal is the most objective way to remain true to yourself and to avoid hindsight bias. More important, it helps you continuously learn from your mistakes, and these insights will be your greatest teachers in life, business, and investing. The significant intrinsic value of learning from one’s personal mistakes (and, even more important, learning vicariously from others’ mistakes) over an investing lifetime is grossly underestimated.

Skinner’s experiments in operant conditioning and behaviorism are his biggest contributions to the field of psychology.

- In his 1996 letter, Warren Buffett explained Berkshire Hathaway’s incentive compensation principles. It is widely regarded as the blueprint for how organizations should design incentive and compensation structures: Goals should be (1) tailored to the economics of the specific operating business; (2) simple in character so that the degree to which they are being realized can be easily measured; and (3) directly related to the daily activities of plan participants. As a corollary, we shun “lottery ticket” arrangements, such as options on Berkshire shares, whose ultimate value—which could range from zero to huge—is totally out of the control of the person whose behavior we would like to affect. In our view, a system that produces quixotic payoffs will not only be wasteful for owners but may actually discourage the focused behavior we value in managers.6 ([Location 4418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4418))

The Code of Hammurabi is among the oldest translated writings and consists of 282 laws, most of them concerning punishment. Taleb and George A. Martin describe law 229 of Hammurabi’s Code as “the best risk management rule”: The Hammurabi rule marks the separation between an agent’s interests and those of the client, or principal, she is supposed to represent. This is called the agency problem in the social sciences. Often closely associated is the problem of moral hazard, wherein an actor has incentive to behave in an economically or socially suboptimal manner (e.g., overly risky) because she does not bear all of the actual and/or potential costs of her action…. The Hammurabi rule solves the joint agency and moral hazard problem by ensuring that the agent has sufficient non-diversifiable risk to incent the agent to act in the joint interest of the agent and the principal.9 ([Location 4453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4453))

- Over the years, I have come to appreciate the fact that investing is a field of simplifications and approximations rather than of extreme precision and quantitative wizardry. I also have realized that investing is less a field of finance and more a field of human behavior. The key to investing success is not how much you know but how you behave. Your behavior will matter far more than your fees, your asset allocation, or your analytical abilities. Even low-cost index funds won’t be able to help you if you succumb to behavioral biases. Most of the time, the real risk is not in the markets but in our behavior. Emotional intelligence has a much bigger impact on the success or failure of investors than the college they attended or the complexity of their investment strategy. Most of the time, their high intellect works against them, because they become so sure of themselves and their abilities that they cannot change their mind. It is always a struggle to keep things simple in a complex world. That struggle is more pronounced for the highly educated people. The smarter you are, the better you are at constructing a narrative that supports your personal beliefs, rationalizing and framing the data to fit your argument or point of view. You may be smart, but not necessarily intelligent, because intelligence is the ability to arrive at accurate cause-and-effect descriptions of reality.

The more uncertain the future of a business, the more possibility there is that the calculation will be wildly off-base [emphasis added].” And, in his 2000 letter, he wrote, “Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a range of possibilities is the better approach [emphasis added].” ([Location 4635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4635))

- A general definition of intrinsic value would be that value which is justified by the facts—e.g., assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects. In the usual case, the most important single factor determining value is now held to be the indicated average future earning power [emphasis added]. Intrinsic value would then be found by first estimating this earning power, and then multiplying that estimate by an appropriate “capitalization factor.” —Benjamin Graham, Security Analysis ([Location 4700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4700))

- The process of determining the intrinsic value of a business is an art form. You cannot follow rigid rules to plug data into a spreadsheet and hope that it spits out the value for you. Stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them, and no shortcuts will give you an exact equilibrium value. Intrinsic value is a moving target that is constantly changing as fundamental data come out and investors update their “expectations” based on knowledge and past experience. In the past, Warren Buffett has described intrinsic value as private owner value, the price that an informed buyer would pay for the entire business and its future stream of cash.

- If we carefully read Benjamin Graham’s definition at the beginning of this chapter, it is interesting to note that he says that future earning power is “the most important single factor determining value.” So the main question we are trying to answer is this: What is the normalized earning power of the business? In other words, if I am a private buyer, how much cash will this business put in my pocket each year, after paying for the expenditures required to maintain my competitive position? What normalized owner earnings can I expect from this business? ([Location 4712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4712))

- Buffett’s definition of owner earnings is widely regarded in the value investing community as the holy grail for understanding the true earning power of a company. Note, however, the subtle omission in Buffett’s definition. Buffett started from reported earnings and then made some adjustments to arrive at owner earnings. But he did not adjust for outlays having a quasi-capex nature, such as advertising or research and development, which are generally treated as an expense in the profit and loss (P&L) statement before reported earnings are arrived at. So the first variable (reported earnings) in Buffett’s equation is likely to be depressed in cases of businesses with emerging moats, that is, businesses that are investing in long-term value-creating initiatives that currently are being expensed in the income statement. Investors should capitalize these types of expenditures and amortize them over a conservatively assumed economic life. Two conditions must be satisfied to warrant such an adjustment: volume growth and market ([Location 4731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4731))

- share gains. Business analysts should treat any money spent that expands the size of the moat as an expenditure that delivers an enduring advantage—just like capex. Businesses that follow conservative accounting, however, treat all this money spent as an expense in the income statement. Such an adjustment, if made, will—in growing businesses in which such expenditures also are growing—result in owner earnings exceeding reported earnings. This is why accounting numbers should always be used only as a basic starting point for investment analysis. ([Location 4740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4740))

- Whether appropriate or not, the term “value investing” is widely used. Typically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low price-earnings ratio, or a high dividend yield. Unfortunately, such characteristics, even if they appear in combination, are far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something for what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the principle of obtaining value in his investments. Correspondingly, opposite characteristics—a high ratio of… ([Location 4749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4749))

- The key point is that for businesses that will grow their earnings even at a moderate pace, but for a very long time, the optically high price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that deter many value investors in reality are pretty low. This means that if you buy a strong moated business at what appears to be a “full price based on current year earnings,” you will end up compounding your money at a higher rate than the discount rate you used to arrive at that “fair price.” The longer the competitive advantage period (CAP), the more likely a business is worth a lot more than what the market thinks. “Durability” of the moat is the key factor. The market tends to underappreciate companies that have really strong moats because the durability often allows for the company’s runway to last longer than many expect.

- My observation has been that the market always displays its wisdom and accords a lower valuation to companies with higher maintenance capex, which thus optically appear to be cheaper than their peers. One needs to derive the maintenance capex figure from the annual report, or get it from management during the conference calls or annual general meetings. (Always cross-check what management says with what they actually report.) Total capex is given in the investing section of the cash flow statement. All capex that is not growth capex must necessarily be maintenance capex. So if we can estimate growth capex, we can estimate maintenance capex. Sometimes it is obvious that almost all the capex is maintenance capex because of competitive pressures. For example, the functional equivalents of Buffett’s shutdown of his textile mills are common in the business world, so do not take the accountants’ definition of capex at face value. Accountants don’t evaluate; they record transactions. They would rather show something as precise even if it is wrong. How a business transaction is recorded does not alter the event or its impact on value. Avoid availability bias by asking, “Is this expenditure likely to result in a sustainable rise in economic earnings in the future?” This will not be the case if the margin or productivity gains have to be fully passed on to the customer; if capex is incurred to replace defunct machinery that will only help the company maintain its current earning power; if the industry is characterized by cutthroat competition or high rates of technological change or obsolescence that requires constant capex for protective reasons or just to keep up with the competition, which keeps inventing new technology applications, thus making old… ([Location 4766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4766))

- Buffett explains how certain asset-heavy businesses with no owner earnings get into trouble when they begin to distribute out of restricted earnings: All earnings are not created equal. In many businesses—particularly those that have high asset/profit ratios—inflation causes some or all of the reported earnings to become ersatz. The ersatz portion—let’s call these earnings “restricted”—cannot, if the business is to retain its economic position, be distributed as dividends. Were these earnings to be paid out, the business would lose ground in one or more of the following areas: its ability to maintain its unit volume of sales, its long-term competitive position, its financial strength. No matter how conservative its payout ratio, a company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is destined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused. Restricted earnings are seldom valueless to owners, but they often must be discounted heavily.4 In these kind of companies, debt issuance and equity dilution occur frequently. New investors keep pouring money into the firm but are never able to take anything out. And if any dividends are paid, they come not from operating cash flow but from the fresh fund infusions made by debt and equity investors. These companies are just recycling cash from new investors to old investors, which is the functional equivalent of a Ponzi scheme. In Berkshire’s fiftieth annual letter, Buffett described these kind of companies: Business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares—just like chain-letter models—most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodically blossom in our country—they are every promoter’s dream—though often they appear in a carefully crafted disguise. The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters, the sums hijacked can be staggering. At both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that is overpriced and—all too often—outright dishonesty [emphasis added].5 Munger also has voiced his opinion on such businesses: Benjamin Graham used to talk about a “frozen corporation”—a company whose charter prohibited it from ever paying out anything to its owners or ever being liquidated or sold. And Graham’s question was, “What is such an enterprise worth?” I do think that it’s an interesting case because I think there is a class of business where the eventual “cash back” part of the equation tends to be an illusion. There are businesses like that—where you just constantly keep pouring it in and pouring it in, but where no cash ever comes back [emphasis added].6 ([Location 4791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4791))

- The working capital component in the owner earnings definition is an important input in the valuation exercise. Any time a business requires additional capital (fixed or working) that will do nothing for rise in unit volume or market share, the money spent should be treated as an expense. When competitive conditions deteriorate, such required expenditures always go up. This increase is usually a warning signal of things to come. If bargaining power is permanently shifting from a business to its customers or suppliers, then the amount of working capital needed by the business just to stand its ground in terms of unit volume and competitive position will increase. That increase is (c) in Buffett’s equation and should be treated as a charge against earnings. Of course, when we do that in practice, then, in many cases, we will find that (c) exceeds (a) + (b), which means that there are no real earnings to speak of. And if there are no real earnings, then there is no real value, although the asset in question may enjoy fabulous market value for a while. As Buffett notes, “Value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime, no matter how high its interim valuation may get.”7 He closed his textile operations when he figured out that there were no owner earnings; he refused to throw good money after bad. In Security Analysis, Graham, contrary to popular belief, actually spends a lot of time discussing future earnings—not what the business earned in the past but rather what we can expect the business to earn each year on average in the future. Graham was signaling that valuation is an art form. Determining the present value of all the future cash flows of a business involves looking at the various aspects of a business’s DNA, including its capital intensity, business model durability, balance sheet strength, profitability, competitive position, future growth prospects, and management bandwidth, among other factors—all weighted and compared with the current price. Some businesses are easier to value than others. Predictability of cash flows is an important factor. Graham talked about this when he said that the security analyst must “use good judgment in distinguishing between securities and situations that are better suited and those that are worse suited to value analysis. Its working assumption is that the past record affords at least a rough guide to the future. The more questionable this assumption, the less valuable is the analysis.”8 ([Location 4819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4819))

- In other words, it is easier to value a business with stable operations and cash flows than a business with high volatility in its underlying operations every year. The intrinsic value is the sum of the present value of the cash flows during the explicit forecasting period and the present value of the terminal value. Less predictable cash flows need to be discounted at a higher rate. This leads us to the discussion regarding the appropriate starting point for the cost-of-capital number. Both Buffett and Munger acknowledge that calculating a company’s cost of capital is an inexact art that does not result in a precise estimate. This is reflected in their comments during the 2003 annual meeting: Buffett: Charlie and I don’t know our cost of capital. It’s taught at business schools, but we’re skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital that we have. We measure everything against our alternatives. I’ve never seen a cost of capital calculation that made sense to me. Have you Charlie? Munger: Never. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs—in other words, it’s your alternatives that matter. That’s how we make all of our decisions. The rest of the world has gone off on some kick—there’s even a cost of equity capital.

- Security Analysis discussed the concept of a range of value: The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. It needs only to establish that the value is adequate—e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase—or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient [emphasis added].11 ([Location 4862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=4862))

Ten dollars of earnings from a capital-light business like Moody’s, with its low reinvestment requirements, is obviously worth a lot more than the same earnings figure from a capital-intensive business like General Dynamics, so investors should capitalize each of them differently. Investors have to look at each business’s earning power, along with the future prospects of the business, to decide how much they are willing to pay to acquire that business’s future cash flows.

- The lesson from this exercise, I believe, is that investors should always be conscious of starting valuation when placing their bets. With few exceptions, eventually valuations that are simply too high will drift back down to more reasonable levels, often at the expense of poor intermediate-term performance. This appears to be true no matter how revolutionary the new business appears to be, and no matter how much potential you believe it has [emphasis added]. Of course, if your conviction is such that you plan on holding your shares for multiple decades, valuation may indeed matter less to long-term returns, but that is assuming you follow through on your commitment.

- For example, buying a low-quality public sector bank in India at 30 percent to 40 percent of book value can work out well if and when the stock gets revalued to 100 percent of book value. But over ten- or fifteen-year periods or longer, paying even three times book value for a high-quality, well-managed franchise like HDFC Bank should deliver better results. (Between two lenders with similar levels of return on equity and growth, I would prefer the lender with a higher price-to-book valuation for two reasons: (1) growth capital in the future would be available at a lower equity dilution, and (2) a higher price-to-book valuation tends to signify important nondisclosed aspects like superior underwriting skills, robust internal processes, and better quality of the loan book.) Having started out as Grahamites—which, by the way, worked fine—we gradually got what I would call better insights. And we realized that some company that was selling at 2 or 3 times book value could still be a hell of a bargain because of momentums implicit in its position, sometimes combined with an unusual managerial skill plainly present in some individual or other, or some system or other. —Charlie Munger ([Location 5047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=5047))

- The Graham and Dodd investor believes in mean reversion—that is, bad things will happen to good businesses and good things will happen to bad businesses. Buffett–Munger–Fisher investors invest in businesses with fundamental momentum, that is, a high probability of sustaining excess returns over long periods of time. These two ideologies often clash (mean reversion versus fundamental momentum) in the value investing community. For most businesses, mean reversion applies, but for some exceptional ones, it starts applying after a prolonged period of time, and until then, fundamental momentum applies. Although Benjamin Graham is widely renowned as a deep value investor, the profits from his single growth stock investment, GEICO, were more than all his other career investments combined. In 1948, Graham’s investment partnership (Graham-Newman) purchased 50 percent of GEICO for $712,000. By 1972, this was worth $400 million. Graham had scored a Peter Lynchian five-hundred-bagger. He later wrote, “Ironically enough, the aggregate of profits accruing from this single investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the others realized through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the partners’ specialized fields, involving much investigation, endless pondering, and countless individual decisions.”5 ([Location 5063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=5063))

- In 1955, Benjamin Graham had to testify on the state of the stock market before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. The following excerpt is from an exchange between Graham and the committee chair: Chair: When you find a special situation and you decide, just for illustration, that you can buy for 10 and it is worth 30, and you take a position, and then you cannot realize it until a lot of other people decide it is worth 30, how is that process brought about—advertising, or what happens? Graham: That is one of the mysteries of our business, and it is a mystery to me as well as to everybody else. We know from experience that eventually the market catches up with value. It realizes it in one way or another.1 Graham’s response to the question regarding an undervalued stock rising to a level of fair valuation captures the essence of the process of mean reversion. But what causes this revaluation? For that, an understanding of the capital cycle is essential. A capital cycle is based on the premise that the prospect of high returns will attract capital (which results in intense competition), just as low returns repel it. The resulting ebb and flow of capital affects long-term returns for stockholders in what often are predictable ways—this is termed the capital cycle.

- When investing in commodities and cyclicals, look for industries that are in a major down cycle and are starved for capital. This step should be followed by a detailed analysis of the fundamentals of individual companies and behavioral insights within the sector to uncover stocks that are selling at a significant discount to their intrinsic value. Next, conduct a stress test to check whether the short-listed companies have manageable debt and are capable of surviving another couple of years in a downturn. Then wait for a few companies in the industry to go bust or shut down some plants and initiate your buying activity after that happens, while pessimism levels are high. As the cycle starts turning, add more to your position. Given the contrarian and long-term nature of the capital cycle approach to investing, this strategy entails firm variant perception and long holding periods.

This scenario is even more significant if it happens amid overly negative sentiment for the sector in question. This is one of the best ways to identify inflection points in a sectoral trend that occur as an industry’s fortunes are beginning to turn around. Most of the time, we observe that the stocks that are going up together so rapidly do not have any current earnings to support their valuations, but we generally realize only in hindsight that the market was an extremely smart discounting machine. It is why Gerald Loeb said, “The market is better at predicting the news than the news is at predicting the market.” Always respect the wisdom of the collective. If a particular stock displays a price volume breakout to fifty-two-week/multiyear/all-time highs on large volumes, then that stock is a strong candidate to start researching. (In technical analysis parlance, if a stock’s price rise is on low volumes, it may be topping out, and if the price remains range-bound on large volumes, it implies a distribution is being made. Chartists prefer a decrease in volume when a stock is in its consolidation phase.) ([Location 5211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=5211))

- Techno-Funda investors tend to believe in two key principles, in addition to strong earnings growth and industry fundamentals, when analyzing potential buys: first, stocks that show relative strength, that is, that go sideways or consolidate during significant market pullbacks, tend to outperform significantly during the subsequent market recovery; and, second, the first stocks that break out to new fifty-two-week highs after, or during, a major correction tend to become the leaders of the next rally. The beauty of the Internet and social media is that everyone has access to the best brains on the planet for a marginal cost. The fifty-two-week high list is often a shortcut to the minds of smart investors. At any given time, the market has only a few great growth stories but hundreds of institutions want to own them. For these institutions, it’s all about catching the next big thing, and price-to-earnings ratios are a secondary consideration. Trends persist because supply is limited—early buyers are not eager to sell, and plenty of new buyers would like to participate. There’s always a scarcity of great growth stories, and markets love high growth. Even if you do not end up investing in any of the breakout stocks, the positive takeaway from this exercise would be the fact that your mental database will have expanded by studying the annual reports, presentations, and conference call audio recordings and transcripts of the various companies in the industry. (Conference calls are a vital component of any serious investor’s research activity list.) For truly passionate investors, researching new companies is just delightful and never gets old. The importance of insatiable intellectual curiosity, along with a deep passion for continuous learning, cannot be overstated in the investing profession. In investing, all knowledge is cumulative, and the insights we acquire by putting in the effort today often help us in a serendipitous way at some time in the future. Work hard today to let good luck find you tomorrow. Opportunities in the stock market can spring to life on short notice. To take advantage of them, you must be prepared and ready to act. Make sure you properly allocate your time playing offense as well as defense. Playing defense means monitoring the companies you already own, and playing offense means scanning the other thousands of listed companies for new and superior ideas. There’s a lot of truth to the expression “The harder I work, the luckier I get.” If you spend many weeks and months evaluating a business and end up discarding the name after doing all the work, it is not a waste of time. This time is very well spent. You gain insight about the business, which you put in your mental data bank, which in turn alerts your subconscious when a similar or related opportunity is presented the future, because you know the background and the context and can assess it faster. Our results today are the fruits of the hard work done in the past.… ([Location 5232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=5232))

- I gained many valuable lessons on commodity investing during my extensive study of the field in 2017: •   Well-managed low-cost commodity producers usually do not generate higher returns. High-cost producers do, because they show a higher percentage gain in profitability. This is highly counterintuitive for most investors. •   A commodity up-cycle lifts all the players in the industry. This is where the low base effect becomes essential. It is relatively easier to improve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins from 5 percent to 10 percent than from 20 percent to 40 percent. This is why the laggards score over the leaders. This makes their stocks go up much faster. In investing, always focus on delta, that is, on the rate of change in earnings growth and its underlying quality. •   When comparing commodity stocks and deciding which one to buy, evaluate them in terms of enterprise value (EV) to installed capacity. HEG was cheaper than Graphite India on this metric. •   Most of the time, sector leaders move up first and become expensive. Then the attention turns to the secondary players in the industry. Investors begin to realize that these secondary players are cheaper, and they bid them up. •   For loss-making companies with sizeable revenues and a low market cap-to-sales ratio, even a small improvement in profit margin adds a significant number to the profit value. In addition, loss-making companies usually have sizeable tax loss carryforwards from the previous down-cycle, resulting in lower taxes and high net profits during the up-cycle. Newbie investors extrapolate these temporary supernormal profit numbers into infinity, and they chase these stocks at close to their peak earnings. You will hear analysts (and sometimes even renowned investors) say, “This time it’s different, and it is a structural long-term change in the industry dynamics, which should drive sustainably-higher valuation multiples.” During boom times for any commodity, people forget how horrible the past down-cycle was and how horrible the future one will be, too. •   Commodity stocks are valued on an EV/EBITDA multiple, not on price-to-earnings. Investors in commodity stocks need to shift focus away from the profit-and-loss statement to a balance sheet–driven approach. When looking at a commodity stock, debt is one of the most important items to look at, as it has a significant impact on earnings (because of the tax shield on interest payments) and on market cap during an up-cycle. As operating cash flows improve, debt falls, and EBITDA rises for the highly leveraged players, the entire debt reduction amount flows to the equity side of the enterprise value equation and market cap rises sharply. Some companies use the favorable business conditions to refinance their debt at more favorable terms and lower rates of interest, giving a material boost to their earnings per share. •   Instead of looking at just the total installed capacity,… ([Location 5345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=5345))

- Spinoff companies often do not publicize the attractiveness of their business and undervaluation of their stock as they prefer to initially fly under the radar. Klarman explains that this is “because management often receives stock options based on initial trading prices; until these options are, in fact, granted, there is an incentive to hold the share price down. Consequently, a number of spinoff companies make little or no effort to have the share price reflect underlying value.”5 ([Location 6521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6521))

- Klarman states that the parent company also can represent an attractive investment opportunity in certain cases. He frequently recommends spinoffs as a fertile ground for finding attractive investments. In a 2009 speech at the Ben Graham Center for Investing, Klarman said, “Spinoffs are an interesting place to look because there’s a natural constituency of sellers and there’s not a natural constituency of buyers.”6 Joel Greenblatt is the most widely known proponent of investing in spinoffs. In his seminal book on special situation investing, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, Greenblatt dedicates a full seventy-six pages to a discussion of spinoffs. Greenblatt quotes a Penn State study that found spinoffs outperform the market by 10 percent per year. If you assume that the market will return 10 percent, then, theoretically, you can make 20 percent per year by just blindly buying spinoffs. What if you selectively choose which spinoffs to invest in? You potentially could exceed 20 percent. Next, Greenblatt discusses five reasons why a parent may spinoff a subsidiary: ([Location 6526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6526))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 1. Usually, conglomerates trade at a “conglomerate discount.” By separating the unrelated businesses, management can “unlock” value. In other words, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. 2. To separate a “bad” business from a “good” business. 3. To realize value for a subsidiary that can’t easily be sold. 4. To recognize value while avoiding a large tax bill that would become due if the parent company pursued a sale instead of a spinoff. 5. To resolve a regulatory hurdle. For instance, a company may be in the process of being acquired. It may need, however, to spin off a subsidiary to address antitrust concerns. Another reason why spinoffs do so well, as Greenblatt explains, is “because capitalism, with all its drawbacks, actually works.”7 Once a spinoff is complete, its management is freed from the bureaucracy of the parent and is empowered to make changes that will create shareholder value, because if management owns a significant portion of the spinoff’s stock, they will benefit directly. Greenblatt writes, “A strategy of investing in the shares of a spinoff or parent company should ordinarily result in a preselected portfolio of strongly shareholder-focused companies.” By proceeding with a spinoff, a management team makes a strong statement that it cares about shareholder returns. Next, Greenblatt explains how to pick the best spinoffs and shares the characteristics he looks for: 1. Institutions don’t want it (and their reasons don’t involve the investment merits). In addition to the reasons outlined so far, it is common for the spinoff entity to be loaded up with debt or cash. Loading up the spinoff is a way for the parent company to transfer these assets and liabilities in a tax-free manner. Understanding what the post-spinoff balance sheet looks like helps investors better analyze its potential performance. Greenblatt talks about how the presence of leverage can result in asymmetrical payoffs: Say what you will about the risks of investing in such companies, the rewards of sound reasoning and good research are vastly multiplied when applied in these leveraged circumstances. Tremendous leverage would magnify our returns if spinoff turned out, for some reason, to be more attractive than its initial appearances indicated [emphasis added]. 2. Insiders want it.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Always study insider incentives. A way to do that is to pull out the spinoff’s Form 10-12B filing (in the United States, this is the document that the parent company files with the SEC before the separation) and search for “executive compensation.” There, we should be able to learn how many shares of the spinoff are reserved for the new management and employee incentives. For example, a spinoff may have the following in its Form 10-12B: “The aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to incentive awards under the Equity Plan is the sum of X shares.” Then, simply calculate what percentage of the spinoff’s total shares outstanding these shares represent. In his investing classic One Up on Wall Street, Peter Lynch speaks highly about the merits of spinoffs. He begins by saying, “Spinoffs often result in astoundingly lucrative investments.”8 Lynch believes parent companies do not want to spin off divisions that could fail, as this… ([Location 6577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6577))

- Spinoffs receive little attention from Wall Street, are usually misunderstood, and thus are mispriced by investors. All this bodes well for future returns. Lynch recommends looking for spinoffs with insider buying, as this will confirm the management’s belief in the spinoff’s long-term potential: “If you hear about a spinoff, or if you’re sent a few fractions of shares in some newly created company, begin an immediate investigation into buying more. A month or two after the spinoff is completed, you can check to see if there is heavy insider buying among the new officers and directors. This will confirm that they, too, believe in the company’s prospects [emphasis added].”10 Remember, insiders may sell for many reasons, including personal ones. But insiders have only one reason to buy their own stock: they believe it will go up. A particularly strong insider buying signal is what is known as a cluster-buy.

- When Buffett talks about a dollar of retained capital creating a dollar of market value (he prefers to apply this test on a five-year rolling basis), he is talking about a dollar of intrinsic value. His implication is that the stock market will be a fairly accurate judge of intrinsic value over time. (A simple way to do a quick one-dollar test is to compare the change in beginning and ending market value of a company over a period of time to the change in its beginning and ending retained earnings values.) Basically, Buffett is saying that the market, over time, will reward those companies that create high returns on the dollars they keep (by giving them a higher valuation multiple) and will punish those companies whose retained dollars fail to earn their keep (by giving them a lower valuation multiple).

- The longevity of growth is always given a greater weight by the market than the absolute rate of growth, so you often will notice stocks with 12 percent to 15 percent predictable earnings growth for the next ten to fifteen years getting current year price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 40× to 50×. This phenomenon perplexes most new investors, but with experience, they come to appreciate the finer nuances of the market and respect its wisdom. The expensive, high-quality secular growth stocks tend to remain at elevated valuations for extended periods of time because investors in such stocks generally are willing to sit out periods of high valuation until earnings catch up. Markets provide disproportionate rewards to companies that can promise years of sustainable earnings growth. ([Location 6685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6685))

- The principle of scarcity premium applies to the number of high-growth stocks available in an individual sector as well as in the overall market. A business with a perceived sustainable growth rate of 30 percent to 35 percent often ends up getting a 40× to 50× P/E (or an even higher valuation that generally keeps expanding throughout the entire duration of the bull run, as long as the high growth expectations are intact) if only a few companies in the market are able to achieve such high growth rates. In contrast, a business growing at 20 percent may not get more than 15× to 20× P/E if many 20 percent growers are available. (This is why looking at the P/E-to-growth ratio, also known as PEG ratio, in isolation can result in suboptimal return outcomes.)

During bearish phases, investors want certainty of growth (whereas during bullish phases, they are ready to take a leap of faith). During such periods of uncertainty, the market’s focus becomes extremely narrow, and valuations of the select few high-quality growth stocks in the market keep expanding until their growth rate remains at above-average levels relative to the majority of the stocks in the market. (Most investors remain in denial during this phase, as these expensive stocks keep becoming more expensive.) When growth finally starts decelerating, the valuation derating begins.

- Recall Buffett’s definition of the best business to own. I love the business Munger talks about, which cuts me a check every year from its owner earnings. Ideally, however, I am looking for a business that will forgo sending me a check because it has attractive internal reinvestment opportunities. In other words, I prefer a business that not only produces high returns on invested capital but also consistently reinvests a large portion of its earnings at similarly high returns. This is the holy grail of long-term value investing. At this point, a business has achieved true internal compounding power, which is the product of two factors: return on incremental invested capital and the reinvestment rate. This compounding power leads to huge value creation over time. This phenomenon was discovered almost a century ago by Edgar Lawrence Smith and was subsequently brought to the attention of the mainstream investment community by John Maynard Keynes, who, in May 1925, reviewed Smith’s book Common Stocks as Long Term Investments. Keynes stated, “[This is] perhaps Mr. Smith’s most important point…and certainly his most novel point. Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to their shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back in the business. Thus, there is an element of compound interest [emphasis added] operating in favor of a sound industrial investment.”12 The two big ideas are reinvested profit and compound interest. Typically, “compounding machines” enjoy a niche positioning or some durable competitive advantage that allows them to achieve high returns on capital for a long time. The key to investing in these reinvestment moats lies in the conviction that the runway ahead for growth is long and that the competitive advantages that produce those high returns will sustain or strengthen over time. When I look at high-ROIC businesses, I am really looking for return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC), that is, the return a business can generate on its incremental investments over time. The growth of a company’s intrinsic value depends on the returns it can earn on its incremental invested capital. Whether growth is good or bad is contingent on ROIIC. For companies that have a large spread between ROIIC and cost of capital, high growth is good and adds a lot of value. All things being equal, for such companies, faster growth translates directly into a higher P/E multiple. The value of high-ROIIC companies is extremely sensitive to changes in perceived rates of growth. Investors tend to confuse ROIIC with ROCE (return on capital employed) or ROIC. ROIIC less cost of capital drives value creation. Even though legacy moat businesses with established franchises and low or no growth opportunities may have high return on invested capital, if you purchase their stock today and own it for ten years, it is unlikely that you will achieve… ([Location 6746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6746))

- growth provides us with a margin of safety not just in the valuation but also in the gap between price and intrinsic value, which widens over time as the business value continues to grow. If two businesses (Company A and Company B) have the same current ROIC of 20 percent, but Company A can invest twice as much as Company B at that 20 percent rate of return, then Company A will create much more value over time for its owners than Company B. Both of these companies will show up as businesses that produce 20 percent ROIC, but one is clearly superior to the other. Company A can reinvest a higher portion of its earnings, and thus it will create a lot more intrinsic value over time. The longer you own Company A, the wider the gap grows between Company A’s and Company B’s investment result. I cannot emphasize this critical fact enough: although valuation is more important over shorter time periods, quality along with growth is much more important over long time periods (seven to ten years and longer). The longer you hold a stock, the more the quality of that company matters. Your long-term returns will almost always approximate the company’s internal compounding results over time. It is far more important to invest in the right business than it is to worry about whether to pay 10× or 20× or even 30× for current-year earnings. Many mediocre businesses are available at less than 10× earnings that lead to mediocre results over time for long-term owners. The intrinsic value of quality business increases over time, thus increasing the margin of safety in the event of a stagnant stock price. This is a pleasant situation because it creates antifragility for an investor. In contrast, if a business is shrinking its intrinsic value, time is your enemy. You must sell it as soon as you can, because the longer you hold it, the less it is worth. ([Location 6772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6772))

- To create significant shareholder value, absolute size of the firm does not matter. Profitability matters. Businesses can achieve high returns through high profit margins. Capital efficiency matters. Businesses with a modest level of margins can achieve attractive returns through high asset and inventory turnover. In both cases, it is the growth in intrinsic value per share that ultimately matters. In the long term, the change in the market value tends to approximate the change in the intrinsic value of the enterprise plus any value added from capital allocation decisions. ROIC can be calculated as owner earnings divided by invested capital, in which invested capital equals ([Location 6833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=6833))

- working capital (excluding excess cash) plus net property, plant, and equipment. Certain long-term value-creating expenditures are not always categorized as capital investments but are expensed on the income statement—things like advertising expenses or research and development (R&D) costs. To be accurate, you would need to know what portion of advertising is needed to maintain current earning power (akin to maintenance capex). The portion above that number would be similar to growth capex, which should be included in capital employed. R&D could be thought of in the same way. Investing is part art, part science, but over the long term, investing in businesses that earn high returns on incremental invested capital significantly improves the probability of achieving above-average returns. Finding a great business that does all of the heavy lifting for you while you passively let value compound is about as good as it gets.

- Making the correct qualitative judgment about a business, including the long-term sustainability of its success attributes, is more important than the entry valuation over a long-term holding period. Within reason, you can survive overpaying for a growing high-quality franchise. If you have to go wrong, go wrong on valuation but not on quality. It seems fitting to end this chapter with Buffett’s views on the topic of quantitative versus qualitative investing: Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school (and as I write this no one has come back from recess—I may be the only one left in the class), the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a “high-probability insight.” This is what causes the cash register to really sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights usually are, and, of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side—the figures should hit you over the head with a baseball bat. So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions [emphasis added].20 ([Location 7038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=7038))

- Benjamin Graham had said, “Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.”2 Read, reread, and reflect on this timeless piece of wisdom by Graham. If you can just adhere to these words throughout your investing career, you are bound to succeed. This advice is what Buffett was referring to when he shared the secret to becoming rich in the stock market: “I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy.

- An important paradox applies to small companies: they are less well researched and yet easier to research. Compared with larger companies, the accounts are simpler, the management is more accessible, and the business segments are few. The market often misprices small-cap companies, as they are relatively illiquid and often ignored by the bigger participants. When it comes to blue-chip stocks, many investors have a common bias that reminds me of the “bystander effect” seen in the Kitty Genovese murder. (No one who witnessed the crime called the police because they all thought someone else would.) Many investors avoid looking at the widely followed large-cap stocks because they assume that everyone else does. These investors assume that such stocks must be fully priced and that they lack the possibility of having an edge. The astonishing reality, however, is that the ever-present characteristics of greed and fear focus on short-term thinking, lack of patience, and the innate desire for instant gratification among market participants frequently lead to stock prices of even the large-cap blue-chip companies temporarily becoming grossly out of line with their underlying intrinsic value (table 23.1).

- Many articles, books, and white papers on investing recommend having a highly diversified investment portfolio. The reality, however, is that all you are doing in this case is swapping one type of risk for another. You are exchanging company-specific risk (unsystematic risk), which may be quite low, depending on the type of company in which you invest, for market risk (systematic risk). Risk hasn’t been reduced, it simply has been transferred from one form to another. Diversification of investments is touted as reducing both risk and volatility. Although a diversified portfolio indeed may reduce your overall level of risk, it also may correspondingly reduce your potential level of reward. The more extensively diversified an investment portfolio, the greater the likelihood is that it, at best, mirrors the performance of the overall market.

- Formulated by John L. Kelly and popularized by the practical success of Ed Thorp, the Kelly criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal bet size for a given set of probabilities and payoffs.

- If an individual knows the odds and payouts of a given bet with precision, the Kelly criterion bet size will maximize capital over the long run. A key difficulty, however, is that people don’t get precise odds, and only in the rare special situation or arbitrage do they obtain a reasonable picture of the payout. Another hurdle is that, when utilizing Kelly, the long run is based on the number of events, not on a time frame. An investor who bets infrequently will have trouble making enough investments to get the full long-term benefits of applying Kelly. Another key limitation is that people tend to underestimate the role of infrequent, high-impact events, or Taleb’s black swans. The probability and downside magnitude of negative black swans may not be given the necessary consideration when investors look to apply the Kelly criterion, and thus the formula, when applied by the human mind, may tend to overestimate F. And continual overestimation leads to ruin. Anything above the optimal bet size will lead to total loss sooner or later. Despite the practical difficulties and impediments in its application to real-world investing, the underlying logic behind the Kelly criterion is highly beneficial as a way to think about whether to establish a position in a given situation and, if one is to be established, what proportion of capital should be invested in that position.

- I size individual allocations in my portfolio according to my evaluation of potential risk, with the largest holdings having the lowest likelihood of permanent capital loss coupled with above-average return potential. I initiate new positions with a minimum weighting of 5 percent and subsequently average upward if the management executes above my expectations. Individual position sizing is important not only for its impact on overall portfolio performance but also for mental peace of mind. I sell down to my “sleeping point” if an individual position becomes a discomfortingly large percentage of my portfolio value. Always have bigger weights in businesses with high longevity, solid growth prospects, and disciplined capital allocators. As Mae West said, “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.” Our constant focus as investors should be on increasing the intrinsic value of our portfolio and letting the market give us gains according to its own schedule. If we are patient, we eventually will get rewarded, because financial markets ultimately take money away from mediocre and stagnant businesses and redirect it toward growing, profitable ones. Money never sleeps. Every crisis brings an opportunity. We have a better way to look at the world and to think deeply about our investments. This is the glass-half-full approach, and it comes from a basic understanding of how capitalism functions. Every bust in one area of the market establishes the foundations for a boom in another. Every company’s rising cost is another company’s rising revenue; every company’s declining revenue is another company’s declining cost. The best part is that the stock market usually does an excellent job of recognizing the beneficiaries in each situation by sending their stocks to the fifty-two-week-high list. Money has a metaphysical-like attraction to places of its best possible use. This is one of the powerful correcting forces of capitalism. Take advantage of it.

- In 2007, Buffett gave a talk to a group of MBA students at the University of Florida, wherein he shared his thoughts on the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM): To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need, and that’s foolish. That is just plain foolish. Doesn’t make any difference what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. I don’t care whether the odds are 100 to one that you succeed or 1,000 to one that you succeed. If you hand me a gun with a thousand chambers—a million chambers in it—and there’s a bullet in one chamber, and you said, “Put it up to your temple, how much do you want to be paid to pull it once?” I’m not going to pull it. You can name any sum you want but it doesn’t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. [Laughter.] So I’m not interested in that kind of a game.

- Always be aware of the potential downside. If the consequence of an action is not acceptable to us, then, no matter how low the probability, we must avoid that action. If bankruptcy, death, or loss of reputation are one of the potential downside risks, then it doesn’t really matter what the various upside possibilities are because they become totally irrelevant. Certain bets in life, regardless of how asymmetric they may appear, should be avoided by any prudent individual. The key to long-term survival is planning your life to prepare for the odds of bad luck, which in turn requires a strategic focus on diversification, room for error, and avoiding single points of failure, particularly big, noninsurable risks. It is fine to trust our intuition on the small decisions, but we should always carefully think through the big decisions in our lives to avoid potentially fatal mistakes. This is why Buffett says, “We don’t have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest.”6 A peaceful night’s sleep and assured survival is much more important than higher relative returns for one’s overall well-being. Charlie and I believe in operating with many redundant layers of liquidity, and we avoid any sort of obligation that could drain our cash in a material way. That reduces our returns in 99 years out of 100. But we will survive in the 100th while many others fail [emphasis added].

This is the easiest way to make decisions. 2. Outcomes are unknown, but probabilities are known. In this case, the range of outcomes is known but the individual outcome is unknown. This is risk. Think of this as gambling in Vegas, where all of the outcomes at the table are known, as are the probabilities of each. 3. Outcomes are unknown and probabilities are unknown.

- According to Sebastian Mallaby, In the early 1960s, a maverick mathematician named Benoit Mandelbrot argued that the tails of the distribution might be fatter than the normal bell curve assumed; and Eugene Fama, the father of efficient-market theory, who got to know Mandelbrot at the time, conducted tests on stock-price changes that confirmed Mandelbrot’s assertion. If price changes had been normally distributed, jumps greater than five standard deviations should have shown up in a daily price data about once every seven thousand years. Instead, they cropped up about once every three to four years [emphasis added].9 Benoit Mandelbrot was a Polish-born mathematician and polymath who developed a new branch of mathematics known as fractal geometry, which recognizes the hidden order in the seemingly disordered, the plan in the unplanned, the regular pattern in the irregularity of nature. Mandelbrot found that the underlying power law that was evident in random patterns in nature also applies to the positive and negative price movements of many financial instruments. The movement of stock prices followed a power law rather than a Gaussian or normal distribution. In his book The (Mis)Behavior of Markets, written with Richard Hudson, Mandelbrot invoked the important concept of “clustering”: Market turbulence tends to cluster. This is no surprise to an experienced trader…. They also know that is in those wildest moments—the rare but recurring crisis of the financial world—where the biggest fortunes of Wall Street are made and lost. …Periods of big price changes groups together, interspersed by intervals of more sedate variation—the tell-tale marks of long memory and persistence. It shows scaling. …Large price changes tend to be followed by more large price changes, positive or negative. Small changes tend to be followed by more small changes. Volatility clusters [emphasis added]. 10 Clustering as a concept resembles the Pareto principle, which states that, for many events, 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. The clustering phenomenon has important implications for investors. Market returns are largely clustered, followed by long periods of a ranged move. Volatility is often the greatest at turning points, diminishing as a new trend becomes established. Patience is extremely important. Beyond a certain point on a larger portfolio size, compounding becomes powerful. Long-term survival ensures a high probability of making money. Within our portfolio, returns are clustered. A few stocks account for the bulk of the returns. Appropriate allocation is the key to generating better returns. While studying an investment idea, our research efforts are clustered. A small fraction of the information and analysis determines the action on an idea. Valuation clusters. We spend large amounts of time either in overvaluation or in undervaluation.

- Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences. We all contemplate and understand the things that happen within three standard deviations, but everything important in financial history takes place outside those three standard deviations. Still, many smart people do not consider these kinds of rare events to be even remotely plausible. In addition, complex mathematical models that can purportedly manage fat-tail risks create the illusion of control. Consequently, these people express this overconfidence in their beliefs by betting the entire house on their preferred bet and piling up tons of leverage.

- Never bet your entire capital on a single stock or sector. Even if you hold stocks from different industries, diversify thoughtfully to ensure that they are not vulnerable to a cascading impact from any one single event or common factor, such as all of them having operations in a common city or state or any other common-risk concentration factors. Statistically, any investment opportunity can appear to be attractive, but statistics, by definition, apply to a group. The bigger the sample size, the higher the statistical significance of the pattern observed. By putting all our money on an “almost” sure-shot bet, we could end up making a fatal financial mistake. Howard Marks shared a story about a gambler who bet everything on a race with only one horse in it. How could he lose? “Halfway around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.

- French polymath Gustave Le Bon wrote one of the most influential works on social psychology, The Crowd, as a rant on French politics, but his observations also describe how stock market manias take place. The book, widely considered to be the definitive work on mass psychology, despite its 1895 publishing date, explains how a crowd goes from controlled logic to uncontrolled emotion, resulting in conscious personalities vanishing into a collective mind. Under the influence of crowds, individuals act bizarrely, in ways they never would alone. The key finding in Le Bon’s work is that crowds are mentally unified at the lowest, most barbaric common denominator of their collective unconsciousness—instincts, passions, and feelings—not at the level of facts or reason. Crowds are impressed by spectacle, images, and myths. Misinformation and exaggeration become contagious. Prestige attaches to true believers who reaffirm shared beliefs. Under these conditions, crowds chase a delusion until it is finally destroyed by experience. Jesse Livermore is quoted as saying: There is profit in studying the human factors—the ease with which human beings believe what it pleases them to believe; and how they allow themselves—indeed, urge themselves—to be influenced by their cupidity or by the dollar-cost of the average man’s carelessness.

- Conditional probability, also known as Bayes’s rule, measures the probability of an event, given that another event has occurred. In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman has simplified the formula for us: “The simplest form of Bayes’s rule is in odds form, posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio, where the posterior odds are the odds (the ratio of probabilities) for two competing hypotheses.”13 According to this equation, one’s prior beliefs (prior odds) are subject to revision with the help of the likelihood ratio. The higher that ratio, the higher should be the change in one’s view of a given situation. Although prior beliefs can come from many sources, an excellent source is base rates, which represent historical statistical information. The likelihood ratio represents new information about a specific case that changes the odds. The higher the likelihood ratio, the higher the posterior odds. Sometimes the information and characteristics specific to the situation being examined are so vivid and persuasive that it leads us to overlook the base rates or the average historical experience. In those cases, Munger’s warning usually comes true: “When you mix raisins with turds, you’ve still got turds.”14 ([Location 11055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=11055))

When Buffett avoids investing in turnaround situations, it is because he relies on base rates. According to him, “Turnarounds seldom turn.”19 (This is why the best time to buy a turnaround is when evidence of a turnaround is already in place. You won’t get in at the bottom, but you will have eliminated a lot of risk and uncertainty.) When Buffett avoids investing in fast-changing high-technology businesses and justifies that by stating that “severe change and exceptional returns usually don’t mix,”20 he is relying on base rates.

Many investors in the Indian markets have a prejudice against Hyderabad-based companies, microcap stocks, turnaround situations, conglomerates, highly leveraged companies, commodity stocks, and holding companies. That prejudice (baseline information) is reflected in the cheaper valuations. “At the same time, however,” writes Bakshi, “you should recognize the possibility that this particular business which you are evaluating could be different from the statistical class to which it belongs.” (For instance, I usually begin studying select leveraged distress situations after the borrowers have entered into a formal debt-restructuring arrangement.)

- One should not hurriedly sell a great business if it becomes temporarily overvalued (and if the stock in question is a bull market sector leader, then one should have the courage to hold on to it for the entire length of the bull run). In great businesses, one tends to get frequent positive surprises, and they tend to end up delivering much better performance than we initially envisaged (as was the case, for instance, with Bajaj Finance). When you find the goose that lays golden eggs, don’t sell the goose. One big lesson I have learned over the years is to be reluctant to sell a great business that is trading at expensive valuations, especially when cash is the alternative. A better approach is to wait to sell until a far superior opportunity comes along, or until the stock has become absurdly overvalued. When we perceive great companies to be fairly valued on an immediate, short-term basis, they often are significantly undervalued on a long-term basis. As Fisher wrote in his book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits: How can anyone say with even moderate precision just what is overpriced for an outstanding company with an unusually rapid growth rate? Suppose that instead of selling at twenty-five times earnings, as usually happens, the stock is now at thirty-five times earnings. Perhaps there are new products in the immediate future, the real economic importance of which the financial community has not yet grasped. Perhaps there are not any such products. If the growth rate is so good that in another ten years the company might well have quadrupled, is it really of such great concern whether at the moment the stock might or might not be 35 percent overpriced? That which really matters is not to disturb a position that is going to be worth a great deal more later. …If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is—almost never [emphasis added].29 ([Location 11217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=11217))

- Over the long term, stocks should outperform most other asset classes and should almost certainly earn higher returns than cash. Cash will always prove to be valuable on occasion, but over a period of twenty to thirty years, the drag on portfolio performance from holding cash will be much more significant than the few occasional benefits one would get from taking advantage of any periodic downturn with “dry powder.” John Templeton’s quote on the subject of “when to invest” is one of my favorites: “The best time to invest is when you have money. This is because history suggests it is not timing which matters, but time.”30 The key to wealth creation is to buy high-quality, growing businesses at reasonable valuations and then just sit on them for a very long time. If you take any random sample of a hundred successful investors who have compounded their capital at a good rate for a long time, you will invariably observe that almost all of them would have bought some great businesses and then just sat tight on them. As Munger says, “The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.”31 ([Location 11232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=11232))

- An effective way to counter this bias is to mentally liquidate your portfolio before the start of every trading day and ask yourself a simple question: “Given all the current and updated information I now have about this business, would I buy it at the current price?” If you conclude that you would not buy the shares today but find that you cannot push the sell button, be aware that this is because of endowment bias and not because of a logical hold thesis. Sell. Clinging to stocks with unsatisfactory expected future returns from their current price is a costly mistake that negatively affects an investor’s long-term net worth. The opportunity cost mental model should be used in conjunction with the circle of competence principle. Things that you are incapable of understanding should not form part of the opportunity set from which you determine your opportunity cost. If I come across a superlative investment opportunity within my circle of competence, then I do not mind immediately selling the weak holdings, if any, in my portfolio, even at a loss, if required, without any hesitation. At any time, we always hold one or two stocks in our portfolio that are our “least favorites.” They are not always bad stocks per se. We just are subconsciously aware that they are weaker than the other stocks in our portfolio (but we still tend to hold on to them!) and that we would not mind selling them at a future date, if required. When you come across what you strongly believe is a great investment idea, conduct a rigorous analysis to actively search for disconfirming evidence within all your existing holdings. In most cases, you will find that your smallest-weight holdings will be the ones that get sold, because you had less conviction in them to start with (as indicated by their low weights).

- Is there a way we can overcome availability bias when faced with a complex problem? Turns out, there is indeed a simple way to do it. It’s simple but not easy. It requires us to train our minds to think in a certain manner. According to Sanjay Bakshi: Well, Charlie already taught us how to do that; we just follow what he says. We try to look at a problem from multiple perspectives. That’s, I think, the correct way of doing it. When you are trying to evaluate something, you are trying to ask the question Why? Why did this happen? And when you reflect upon it, you find that the answer sometimes comes from multiple disciplines, and you get down to that and try to figure it out. It is very enjoyable to do it in that way. The process for me has always been to ask the question Why? and wait. Because the mind will tend to jump to a certain answer, and that’s not the only answer. So the way I think about it is, wherever there is a complex question I am trying to answer, I always start with the words “Part of the reason is this”—which means there must be other parts too. I’d like to think about what those parts might be. There don’t have to be twenty of them—even if there are three or four of them, that’s better than one. So it helps me to ask the question Why? and then look for answers [emphasis added].2 When something is at the forefront of our thoughts, we assume it to be correct. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn’t, and usually that involves second- or third-level consequences. Ray Dalio has written about this in his book Principles. Similarly, Howard Marks has often advocated the adoption of second-level thinking. Second-level (and beyond) thinking is to ask, “And then what?” at each stage of the decision-making process, while humbly acknowledging “Part of the reason is this.” Looking at things through the “And then what?” lens can help you avoid making hurried decisions in life based on emotions. Whether you are looking to invest in a business or in a new relationship or career, never forget to ask, “And then what?” It may well turn out to be a lifesaver.

- Just as animals flourish in niches, people who specialize in some narrow niche can do very well. —Charlie Munger Sector leaders in a niche area are promising investments, especially if they are identified at a small market-cap stage. Their products usually enjoy premium pricing and the brand tends to become synonymous with the product category. Think Eicher Motors in leisure motorbikes, Symphony in air coolers, or Page Industries (Jockey India) in underwear. The best competitive advantage is to have no competitors in customers’ minds. The brand recall should be so strong that it should be difficult to recall the next-closest competitor. These businesses tend to have strong bargaining power with customers and suppliers and operate on negative working capital, that is, with other people’s money. The wording “advances from customers” in an annual report is a good cue to start digging. This type of advance is essentially a form of float, which is an unencumbered source of value resulting from the absence of covenants like collateral, repayment dates, or interest.

- Multi Commodity Exchange of India charges fees based on the value of a transaction rather than on volume. A few years back, many investors were citing its high P/E ratio as the reason for avoiding this stock. But this ratio was based on depressed commodity prices prevailing at the time. Investors should always evaluate their long-term ideas based on normalized earning power. Similar opportunities emerge when the current earnings of a company are depressed because of ongoing expansion expenses, which result in an optically high P/E ratio. Investors who primarily rely on screening tools to generate ideas end up missing such opportunities. ([Location 11447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=11447))

- “Cheap” is a poor proxy for value: the new business models…—SaaS [software as a service] in particular—are not well suited to traditional GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] accounting. Here’s why: if distribution costs are zero, the optimal strategy is to gain as many customers for your software product, as quickly as possible. In digital businesses, there are increasing advantages to scale, and many of these companies operate in winner-take-all or winner-take-most markets. The name of the game is thus to build, grow, then monetize. Frequently, this means spending a lot of money in sales and marketing, which depresses reported earnings.

- Thus, SaaS companies spend to acquire customers upfront, and recognize revenue from those customers over many years. This mismatch burdens the income statement. Some of the most successful—and highest performing stocks—in the SaaS world have spent many years growing despite producing no meaningful accounting profits. They are very profitable in terms of unit economics, and once they stop reinvesting every dollar generated into further growth. The traditional method of screening for low P/E stocks doesn’t work in this scenario.2 For these SaaS companies, study the incremental unit economics—that is, how much it costs to acquire each customer and how much value they deliver over a span of time—and then analyze what the business margins and cash flows look like at a steady state once the investment phase slows down. Then discount those cash flows back to the present. In a February 2018 Harvard Business Review article, three professors from the Columbia and Dartmouth business schools, Vijay Govindarajan, Shivaram Rajgopal, and Anup Srivastava, summarized their work on accounting for intangible investments. Their key finding, which builds on Baruch Lev and Feng Gu’s analysis in their book The End of Accounting, is that “accounting earnings are practically irrelevant for digital companies.” Likewise, Govindarajan, Rajgopal, and Srivastava found that reported earnings mean less for younger companies than for older companies because of the different nature of younger companies’ expenditures. In fact, they found that “earnings explain only 2.4 percent of variation in stock returns for a 21st century company—which means that almost 98 percent of the variation in companies’ annual stock returns are not explained by their annual earnings.”3 These claims correlate nicely with those published in Lev and Gu’s book (figure 29.1). The authors found that variations in financial metrics, like earnings and book value, explain 90 percent of the variations in stock prices for companies that went public between 1950 and 1959, compared with explaining only about 20 percent of the variation for companies that have gone public since 2000.

- older firms. This tendency creates a big problem for financial analysts because accounting rules explicitly treat tangible and intangible capital investments differently. When a firm engages in research and development, advertising, software development, or employee training, it must account for those long-term value-creating expenditures in the same way that it accounts for a routine general expense like office space rents. That is, all those productive investments (the upward sloping line in figure 29.1) are treated as expenses and are charged against current period earnings, which significantly depresses reported profits for highly innovative companies. The same mechanism distorts the balance sheet by making assets look artificially low, because if something is expensed, it never makes its way to the balance sheet as an asset. Govindarajan, Rajgopal, and Srivastava found that “intangible investments have surpassed property, plant, and equipment as the main avenue of capital creation for U.S. companies.”4 Yet all these intangible assets are absent from the balance sheet, and thus analysts cannot form accurate opinions about firms’ earning potential. Lev identified this lack of information many years ago as the source of a market anomaly that causes highly innovative companies to systematically outperform their less innovative peers. This anomaly can be termed the “knowledge factor.” ([Location 12228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12228))

- From John Templeton making a fortune by buying a basket of penny stocks on the eve of World War II to Warren Buffett selling super-cat insurance, successful investors have earned extraordinary returns through the unknown and the unknowable, and they have done so on a reasoned, calculated basis. “Unknown and unknowable” refers to the situation in which both the possible future states of the world and their probabilities are unknown and unknowable. “Sidecar investing” is a term introduced by Richard Zeckhauser in his famous essay, “Investing in the Unknown and Unknowable.”5 In this brilliant essay (a must-read for all investors), Zeckhauser shares many important insights.

- Second, some types of unknowable situations have been associated with highly profitable outcomes, and we can think about these situations systematically. People overwhelmingly prefer to take on (measurable and quantifiable) risk in situations in which they know specific odds rather than an alternative risk scenario in which the odds are completely ambiguous. They tend to choose a known probability of winning over an unknown probability of winning, even if the known probability is low and the unknown probability could be a guarantee of winning. (This paradox in decision theory in which people’s choices violate the postulates of subjective expected utility is known as the Ellsberg paradox.) Fear of the unknown is one of the most potent kinds of fear, and the natural reaction is to get as far away as possible from what is feared. Unknown unknowns make most of us withdraw from the game. These, however, are also the circumstances in which extraordinary returns are possible. (Readers should study the case study of the most successful investment ever in the history of mankind—Masayoshi Son’s investment in Alibaba in 1999 which delivered a 6,500× return.) Fortune favors the brave, and market prices and valuations tend to reflect our innate tendency to avoid uncertainty. One way to think about unknowable situations is to recognize the hugely asymmetric payoffs they offer. If you have a chance to multiply your money ten to twenty times, and that chance is offset by the possibility that you could lose all of it in that particular commitment, then it is a good bet to be exercised, provided you are sufficiently diversified. This is how to bet in asymmetric payoffs. This is the Babe Ruth effect in… ([Location 12249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12249))

A related pattern is found when the key professional from a promoter group company with a proven track record of strong execution incubates a new business in a previously dormant listed group entity and infuses personal funds into it through a preferential allotment.

- A big idea I took away from Bruce Greenwald’s book Competition Demystified was the concept of “local economies of scale,” which he demonstrated through the case study of Nebraska Furniture Mart. I often use the criterion of a large single-location facility when selecting an investment in manufacturing businesses. For example, Hester Biosciences operates Asia’s largest single-location animal biological manufacturing facility. Having the entire manufacturing setup in a single location minimizes the cost of logistics. When a business with a primarily fixed-cost structure scales up its operations, the per-unit cost becomes smaller, operating leverage takes over, and net profit grows ([Location 12319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12319))

- exponentially. The fixed cost per unit becomes low compared with small-scale competitors, and it becomes almost impossible for a new entrant to compete on price with the lowest-cost incumbent without bleeding losses for a long time. A lending business that has just raised a large amount of growth capital should be viewed in the same way as a manufacturing business that has just completed a big capacity expansion. In fact, equity dilution is not really bad in the case of richly valued and well-managed financiers with a high return on equity. This is because they are valued on a price-to-book basis. As a result, their intrinsic value actually increases along with book value after a rights issue, a follow-on offering, or a qualified institutional placement. This presents a good opportunity to average upward in such lending businesses, especially those with good or improving asset quality. (Lending businesses with declining nonperforming assets, rising return on equity, and improving provision coverage ratio tend to undergo a valuation rerating. An expanding price-to-book ratio leads to a virtuous cycle for such businesses, which then can raise capital in the future with a lower equity dilution.)

At the time, I had hardly any investing expertise to speak of, but still, within my portfolio, Avanti Feeds went from INR 500 to INR 2,410 (~382 percent), Gati went from INR 60 to INR 275 (~359 percent), Symphony went from INR 700 to INR 1,200 (~71 percent), VST Tillers went from INR 800 to INR 1,740 (~118 percent), Ajanta Pharma went from INR 650 to INR 1,350 (~108 percent), Mayur Uniquoters went from INR 230 to INR 440 (~91 percent), Astral Poly Technik went from INR 250 to INR 400 (60 percent), and Atul Auto went from INR 350 to INR 600 (~71 percent). With the exception of Gati, all these stocks had been purchased on borrowed conviction from some intelligent-sounding discussion on a prominent investing blog in India called ValuePickr. The primary reason for my purchase of all these stocks was my supposedly brilliant personal thought that because these stocks had delivered fabulous returns during the tough economic conditions of the preceding five years (I checked this in the Factset database), then these stocks logically should deliver even better returns during an economic recovery. As for Gati, I naively presumed that if e-commerce grew rapidly in India, then Gati’s courier business would do quite well. I did not even check the quality of the company’s earnings. Just as I had no personal conviction or good understanding of my choices when buying these stocks, I did not have any better insight when selling them. Yes, this is true. This was my pitiful state as an investor at the time, even after being present in the markets since 2007. I had initiated my self-education on value investing in 2013, and the power of compounding knowledge had not yet kicked in. Many of my friends, seniors, and peers bought these stocks at far lower prices and obtained big multibagger returns. Although all of them had deserved success, I was merely a big beneficiary of dumb luck in a bull market. Even during the subsequent three years, a significant portion of my portfolio returns was primarily driven by the valuation rerating of many small-cap and mid-cap stocks in India. Only luck was responsible for me deploying a meaningful amount of capital in stocks in late 2013, which was exactly when the present multiyear bull market in India began. Before that time, I had invested insignificant sums. ([Location 12447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12447))

- Adopt the motto “ABC: Always Be Curious.” (As Charlie Munger often says, if we want to become smarter, the question we need to keep asking is “Why, why, why?”) A questioning mentality is more valuable than a knowing mentality. Questions are more productive and useful than commands for shaping ideas and solutions. Although you can’t force your brain to come up with creative ideas on demand, you can program it to launch the imaginative process simply by asking questions. It is exciting to be curious, because it means you are always discovering something interesting. Inspiration often comes from completely unexpected sources, which is why a curious mind is so beneficial. Albert Einstein once wrote to a friend, “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” Even Leonardo da Vinci’s distinguishing and most inspiring trait was his intense curiosity. Things are constantly happening within the framework of our self-narrating story, which subjectively unfolds alongside an expanding universe that we have yet to fully comprehend. Don’t think about why you question, simply don’t stop questioning. Don’t worry about what you can’t answer, and don’t try to explain what you can’t know. Curiosity is its own reason. Aren’t you in awe when you contemplate the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure behind reality? And this is the miracle of the human mind—to use its constructions, concepts, and formulas as tools to explain what man sees, feels and touches. Try to comprehend a little more each day. Have holy curiosity. —Albert Einstein ([Location 12468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12468))

- In his book The Zurich Axioms, Max Gunther masterfully demonstrates how a complex adaptive system like the stock market is characterized by complete randomness, because human behavior is utterly unpredictable: The fact is, nobody has the faintest idea of what is going to happen next year, next week, or even tomorrow…. It is of the utmost importance that you never take economists, market advisers, or other financial oracles seriously. Of course, they are right sometimes, and that is what makes them dangerous. Each of them, after being in the prophecy business for a few years, can point proudly to a few guesses that turned out right. “Amazing!” everybody says. What never appears in the prophet’s publicity is a reminder of all the times when he or she was wrong. “It’s easy to be a prophet,” the noted economist Dr. Theodore Levitt once told Business Week. “You make twenty-five predictions and the ones that come true are the ones you talk about.” Not many seers are that frank, but all would privately agree with Dr. Levitt’s formula for success. Economists, market advisers, political oracles, and clairvoyants all know the basic rule by heart: If you can’t forecast right, forecast often…. Not all oracles have been able to organize the annual forecast-revising dance of the economists, but all are followers of the basic rule. They all forecast often and hope nobody scrutinizes the results too carefully…. It is easy to get dazzled by a successful prophet, for there is a hypnotic allure in the supposed ability to look into the future. This is especially true in the world of money. A seer who enjoys a few years of frequently right guesses will attract an enormous following…. One of the traps money-world prophets fall into is that they forget they are dealing with human behavior. They talk as though things like the inflation rate or the ups and downs of the Dow are physical events of some kind. Looking at such a phenomenon as a physical event, an oracle can understandably succumb to the illusion that it will be amenable to forecasting. The fact is, of course, that all money phenomena are manifestations of human behavior…. …An oracle can always cry “unforeseeable events” in explanation of a forecast that turns out wrong. But that is just the trouble. Every forecast has the possibility of unforeseeable events ahead of it. No forecast about human behavior can ever be compounded of 100 percent foreseeable events. Every prediction is chancy. None can ever be trusted…. ([Location 12557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12557))

- …Disregard all prognostications. In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word. Nobody…. …Money seems cool, rational, amenable to reasoned analysis and manipulation. If you want to get rich, it would seem that you need only find a sound rational approach. A Formula. Everybody is looking for this Formula. Unfortunately, there isn’t one. The truth is that the world of money is a world of patternless disorder, utter chaos. Patterns seem to appear in it from time to time, as do patterns in a cloudy sky or in the froth at the edge of the ocean. But they are ephemeral. They are not a sound basis on which to base one’s plans…. …It is surprising how many smart people allow themselves to be fooled by the Gambler’s Fallacy…. Toss a coin enough times, and sooner or later you are going to have a long run of heads. But there is nothing orderly about this run. You cannot know in advance when it will start. And when it has started, you cannot know how long it will continue. And so it is with roulette, the horses, the art market, or any other game in which you put money at risk. If you play long enough, you will enjoy winning streaks—perhaps some memorable ones…. But there is no orderly way in which you can cash in on these streaks. You can’t see them coming, and you can’t predict their duration. They are merely one more part of the chaos…. …Countless speculators and gamblers have been bankrupted by failing to quit while they were ahead. The Gambler’s Fallacy tends to encourage that failure, for it engenders the feeling that one is temporarily invincible. That is a dangerous feeling to have. Nobody is invincible, not even for half a second…. It might be hard, indeed, to remain perfectly rational after an experience like that [emphasis added].5 ([Location 12578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12578))

- If that is the case, then how can we separate luck, chance, and randomness from true skill when evaluating investment track records? Lord Krishna provides us with the answer. The Big Investing Lesson from the Bhagavad Gita Karmanye vadhikaraste, ma phaleshou kada chana. Ma karma phala hetur bhurmatey sangostva akarmani. —Bhagavad Gita In this verse from the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna that he must perform his duties, as the latter was unwilling to fight the Mahabharata war. Translated, it reads: You have the right to perform your actions, but you are not entitled to the fruits of the actions.

- Do not let the fruit be the purpose of your actions, and therefore you won’t be attached to not doing your duty. Krishna asks Arjuna to continue performing his duties without being attached to the result of his actions. His teaching is encapsulated in the idea of karma yoga, or the “discipline of action.” The word “karma” is derived from the Sanskrit root kri, meaning “to do.” This is the big lesson for all investors. Focus on the “karma”—the process and action—and not on the outcome. Numerous research studies have identified a common trait among successful professionals in fields of probabilistic activity: they all emphasize process over outcome. Whatever the future holds, we will stick to our process. We are not guaranteed of getting what we want all the time—far from it—but we believe it is the best foundation for getting what we want over time. —Chuck Akre Although the returns (outcome) may be evident for everyone to see, investors rarely ask whether that outcome was the result of skill (a sound investment process) or plain randomness. If you focus only on the outcome, you are less likely to achieve it. Instead, if you focus on adhering to a sound process, the outcome will take care of itself in the long term, although the short-term results almost always will be driven by luck. Over the long run, a sound process can be counted on to deliver desirable results in a sustained manner and produce more reliable outcomes. Robert Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury secretary, said it best: “Any individual decision can be badly thought through, and yet be successful, or exceedingly well thought through, but be unsuccessful, because the recognized possibility of failure in fact occurs. But over time, more thoughtful decision-making will lead to better overall results, and more thoughtful decision-making can be encouraged by evaluating decisions on how well they were made rather than on outcome.”9 ([Location 12632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12632))

- During 2013, I bought shares of Subex solely on the basis of a renowned market expert’s recommendation on business television. The stock promptly crashed by more than 50 percent within a few months of my purchase, and I exited it at a significant realized loss. I wish I had, before this, read Benjamin Franklin’s words: “It is the first duty of every citizen to question authority.” ([Location 12689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12689))

- We live in a world in process, and it changes continuously, every single minute. Nothing stays the same. Thomas Russo likes to give the analogy of a seven-hundred-year-old temple in Japan. The temple is made of wood, and none of the wood is seven hundred years old, as the pieces have been replaced numerous times over the years. But we still talk about the temple as if it is seven hundred years old. In the stock markets, we see the effect of change in similar ways. Consider the S&P 500, one of the most frequently cited market indexes. On average, over the past fifty years, more than twenty companies are swapped out each year. Yet investors cite and treat the S&P 500 as if it were a monolithic, unchanging object. It clearly isn’t. The constituents of the S&P 500 of 2020 are completely different from the S&P 500 of 2000, even though our language infers otherwise when we say things like, “The S&P 500 is trading at a premium/discount to its ten-year average.” ([Location 12728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12728))

- Most investors wait to recover what’s gone rather than retaining what’s left. They don’t realize that loss recovery does not necessarily have to be made from the same stock on which the loss was made. If the story has gone wrong, simply book your losses and move on to a better opportunity. Continuity of compounding is the key to success in this long-term game. After buying a stock, forget what you paid, or this knowledge will forever affect your judgment. ([Location 12757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12757))

- One of the most counterintuitive ideas in investing is averaging upward, or adding to a winning position (also known as pyramiding). If we are invested in a great business that will be worth several times its current market cap (over time, an investor’s mind evolves into thinking in terms of market cap rather than stock price) in the medium to long term, then we must not hesitate to add more shares at a higher (sometimes much higher) ([Location 12767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=12767))

- Envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that offers no upside. Envious people are always miserable, because envy has only downside risks and envy offers no upside reward. We are unnecessarily influenced even when others are playing a different game than we are. Do not compare yourself with others. The only person you need to be better than today is the person you were yesterday. Competing with others makes you bitter. Competing with yourself makes you better. Great wisdom can be found in Ernest Hemingway’s words: “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.” ([Location 13327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081KB6NT6&location=13327))
