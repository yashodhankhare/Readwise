## Highlights
- Despite evidence to the contrary, we all use our brains. But most of us have never learned how to think effectively. I’m not talking about IQ or other measures of intelligence, which matter in their own way, of course. I’m talking about thinking as a learned skill. We don’t teach thinking in schools, and you can see the results of that nearly every day. If you use social media, or you make the mistake of paying attention to other people’s opinions in any form, you’re probably seeing a lot of absurd and unproductive reasoning that I call loserthink.

- Loserthink isn’t about being dumb, and it isn’t about being underinformed. Loserthink is about unproductive ways of thinking. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=70))

- That is not only possible; it’s the normal situation. My observation, after several decades on this planet, is that clear thinking is somewhat rare. And there’s a reason for that. No matter how smart you are, if you don’t have experience across multiple domains, you’re probably not equipped with the most productive ways of thinking.

- Mockery gets a bad rap, but I think we can agree it can be useful when intelligently applied. For example, mocking people for lying probably helps to reduce future lies and make the world a better place, whereas mocking people for things they can’t change is just being a jerk. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=99))

- If you have a negative word for something, it’s easier to avoid it than if you don’t. Before I introduced the term loserthink, what word would you have used to describe a smart person who has a mental blind spot caused by a lack of exposure across different fields? You would probably default to the closest word in your vocabulary, which might be stupid, dumb, idiot, and the like. I don’t have to tell you it’s hard to change someone’s mind after you call him an idiot. And if you take the high road and the intellectual path, describing a person’s mental blind spots with terms such as confirmation bias or cognitive dissonance, your target will claim you are actually the one suffering from those cognitive errors, and the discussion goes nowhere.

- By now you might be wondering why I counsel against calling people stupid while at the same time I introduce the word loserthink, which seems just as bad. The difference is that stupid refers to a person whereas loserthink applies to the technique. And keep in mind that all of us engage in loserthink sometimes. The loser part of loserthink refers to the outcome, not the DNA of the person involved. Remember to make that distinction if you use the term. Calling people stupid will not make them turn smart, but pointing out a bad technique and contrasting it with a good one can, in time, move people to a more productive way of thinking.

- Adding to this effect is that, as human beings, we don’t know what we don’t know. If you have never been exposed to lessons on how to think effectively, you wouldn’t have a frame of reference to know whether or not you were doing it right.

- If you have been exposed to the thinking styles of only a few disciplines, you will have large gaps in your ability to productively think about the world. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=141))

- Anyone with my experience would tell you that most (but not all) financial advice, in terms of picking individual stocks, is bunk. And yet there is an industry full of financial experts who do exactly that and charge large amounts for it. If you asked them how valid their methods were, they would tell you they don’t get it right every time, but on average they are adding a lot of value. Similarly, the field of climate science is a perfect breeding ground for confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, and outright fraud. That doesn’t mean climate scientists are wrong or dishonest, and I make no such claim. But it does mean it would be sensible to dial down your sense of certainty about their rightness. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=164))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you have no experience in the field of science, you might think the climate models created by scientists are “science” because scientists make them. But prediction models are not science. They are an intelligent combination of scientific thinking, math, human judgment, and incomplete data. That’s why there are lots of different climate models, all a bit different. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=213))

- If all you know is how many times someone hit a target, it is loserthink to judge how accurate they are. You also need to know how many times they missed. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=228))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One thing I can say with complete certainty is that it is a bad idea to trust the majority of experts in any domain in which both complexity and large amounts of money are involved. You end up with this: Well, yes, our predictions were completely wrong, but now we know why they were wrong. If you give us a million dollars to fix it, our predictions will be accurate from this point on. Don’t ask me what we fixed or how we did it because you wouldn’t understand. It’s complicated. Whenever you have a lot of money in play, combined with the ability to hide misbehavior behind complexity, you should expect widespread fraud to happen. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=231))
    - Tags: [[pink]]

- The problem, which I learned the hard way, was that what the experts “knew” about nutrition kept changing. Over time, it became painfully obvious to me that nutrition science wasn’t science at all. It was some unholy marriage of industry influence, junk science, and government. Any one of those things is bad, but when you put those three forces together, people die. That isn’t hyperbole. Bad nutrition science has probably killed a lot of people in the past few decades.5 Scientists were wrong when they predicted we had already reached so-called peak oil. Scientists were wrong about the ozone layer being beyond repair (the hole is shrinking).6 Experts were wrong that the year 2000 computer bug would crash computer systems worldwide (it got fixed in time). But if I am being fair, those problems probably got solved because we panicked about them ahead of time. A little bit of creative panic goes a long way.7 ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=249))

- The fields of psychology and economics have shown us in a thousand ways that people are influenced by all sorts of forces while generally not being aware of how much they are being biased. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=259))

- I don’t intend to change your mind about climate change. I haven’t even made up my own mind, and perhaps I never will, given the difficulty in mastering the topic. The point is to show you how your experience, and therefore your filters on a topic, can get you to very different opinions compared to other smart people using the same set of facts. Does your opinion of climate change look a lot like mine, or is it closer to MacFarlane’s view that it makes sense to follow the consensus of experts? My hope is that you can now look at the topic of climate change through more than one filter. For many of you, this will be the first time you can do that. Some of you were already there.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With Dilbert, my primary tools for helping readers escape their mental prisons are humor and mockery. I learned years ago that it is nearly impossible to mock a good idea unless you also lie about its nature or leave out important context. Mockery only succeeds in persuading against absurd beliefs—the kind that form mental prison walls. If I can make you laugh at your situation, I’m probably helping you see your mental prison walls more clearly. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=298))

- The technological change that broke the news business was our ability to measure audience reaction to every headline and every variation of every story. Once you can reliably measure the income potential of different approaches to the news, the people who manage the news have to do what works best for profitability or else they are abandoning their responsibilities to shareholders. On top of that, executive compensation is determined by profit performance. From the moment technology allowed us to know which kinds of content influenced viewership the most, the old business model of the news industry was dead media walking. From that point through today, the business model of the press changed from presenting information to manipulating brains. I want to stress that no one in this story is evil. Everyone is acting according to the well-accepted rules of capitalism, trying to maximize the outcomes for shareholders and their own careers. The main thing that changed was our ability to measure what kinds of content worked best. And when you can measure what works, and you are managing a public business, you are highly incentivized to follow profits, so long as doing so is legal, and in this case it is. Ethics is a separate and important issue, but it isn’t predictive in the context of capitalism. If something is legal and profitable, it will happen, a lot. The inevitable outcome of the press having a business model that rewards brain manipulation versus accuracy is what I call political warming. As the press becomes increasingly skilled at stimulating the emotion centers in our brains, one should expect the public to be in a continuous state of fight-or-flight anxiety. We’re more scared and angry than I imagine we ever have been, at least since World War II. And that means bigger storms ahead in the form of protests and divisiveness.

- If you buy into the full-scary narratives promoted by either the political left or the political right, you’re probably experiencing loserthink. A more useful way to think of the political news is that nearly every major story is exaggerated to the point of falsehood, with the intention of scaring the public. If you think the frightened feeling you are getting from the news is legitimate and appropriate, you probably don’t understand how the business model of the news has changed. Twenty years ago, if the media said something dangerous and scary was heading our way, you had to treat that seriously. Today, the news provides one fright after another, but an understanding of why they do it helps you avoid loserthink. All the doom-and-gloom in the press, and on social media, could give you the impression the world is in big trouble. The reality is almost directly the opposite: things have never been better for humanity, and the future looks incredible too.

- As you read this book, you are likely to see thoughts with which you agree, and other thoughts you will be certain are wrongheaded. Now that you are warned, I recommend keeping in mind the most important thing you will ever understand about the human experience: Being absolutely right and being spectacularly wrong feel exactly the same. That’s the right frame of mind for this book. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=365))

- The impact of all this faulty mind reading is that you and I are often penalized for what other people think we are thinking. I don’t want to be punished for other people’s faulty thoughts.

- If your opinion depends on reliably knowing another person’s inner thoughts, you might be experiencing loserthink. And . . . If an ordinary explanation fits the facts, but you have chosen an extraordinary interpretation instead, you might have too much confidence in your opinion.

- People who have good arguments use them. People who do not have good arguments try to win by labeling.

- Occam’s razor is the idea that the simplest explanation of events is usually the right one. The problem with that line of thinking is that it is complete nonsense, and people who have training in the field of psychology can see the problem right away. In a scientific setting, the simplest explanation that fits the facts is generally preferred. But in the messier nonscientific world, we all think our explanations of the world are the simplest ones. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=481))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Occam’s razor, as it is typically used in debate, is an example of backward thinking. We think we come to our opinions by looking at the various competing explanations and picking the simplest one that fits the data. Sometimes I suppose that is exactly what happens, especially in uncomplicated situations. But for any complicated or “big” question, it is just as likely, if not more, that we arrive at our opinions by some combination of irrational influences and then defend our position by declaring it to be the simplest explanation. Occam’s razor reminds me of someone trying to throw an anvil at an enemy. If you could lift an anvil and throw it a mile, it would be a powerful weapon. But you can’t, so it isn’t. Similarly, if people could accurately deduce which of several competing explanations is the simplest one, Occam’s razor would mean something. But we can’t. So it doesn’t. In science, the simplest explanation that fits the facts is preferred. In life, we are all under the illusion that our explanations of things are the simplest ones.

- In the field of psychology there is a phenomenon called projection. The simple description of projection is that people accuse others of having the flaws the accuser possesses and the target might not. For example, a liar might accuse an honest person of being a liar, and might actually believe it. Or a thief might accuse others of stealing—that sort of thing. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=496))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I don’t believe the average person can tell the difference between an opinion based on observation and something we would properly label projection. If I accuse you of being a liar, it might be because I’m a liar who is projecting, but it could easily be that I’m right and I have caught you in more than one lie. Those situations look the same, and realistically we’re usually not in a position to do fact-checking. Humans aren’t good fact-checkers.

- No matter the topic, all sides typically believe they have the right facts and the other side is delusional. No matter which side is right on any given topic, the one thing we know for sure is that being right and being wrong feel exactly the same to all of us. We can’t tell the difference. If we could, everyone would agree on everything important. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=507))

- The productive way to think of your ego is to consider it a tool, as opposed to a reflection of who you are on some core level. If you think your ego is a tool, you can choose to dial it up when needed and dial it down when it would be an obstacle. When we humans hold a higher opinion of our abilities than the facts warrant, that mindset can lead to better results in sports, test taking, romance, our social lives, careers, and more. That’s because confidence is strongly correlated with success. The sweet spot for self-confidence involves operating with a belief that you can do more than the available evidence suggests, but not so much more that it would be crazy. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=518))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A smaller example involves talking yourself into believing you are the best applicant for a job that many others are trying to get. That belief can come across as confidence, which is a good state of mind to take into a job interview. Confident people perform better under stress. But you don’t want to crank up your ego too much because then you would come across as arrogant. Lying to yourself a little bit—to boost your ego—can be productive. But don’t overdo it. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=526))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When I need to dial up my ego, I remind myself that the people I am about to deal with are a lot like me, in the sense that they too are only pretending to be confident and capable. The world is not a fair place, and there is a good chance the people you are dealing with did not get to where they are because of their intelligence, hard work, and character. As you gain experience in life, that truth becomes more obvious. We’re all putting on an act and hoping the audience buys it. Your act might be somewhat close to your true nature, or it might not be. But it is an act nonetheless. Once you embrace the reality that we all present the “enhanced” versions of our real selves, all the time, you can relax a bit and get into character. It is frightening to believe you are the pretender in a room full of confident professionals. Luckily, that is rarely a description of reality. The common situation—and the one you should treat as true—is that we are deeply flawed humans pretending to be otherwise. You aren’t the one defective person in the room. Ever.

- Learn to make eye contact and to smile. And learn to give a confident handshake. If you do those three things, almost everyone with whom you interact will form a good first impression of you as a confident person. First impressions are sticky. And when people see you as confident, they will treat you as if you are, which reinforces your actual confidence. Another good trick involves thinking about the things you are good at, to remind yourself of your talents and determination. If you aren’t good at anything in particular, try to fix that situation. Find a sport, hobby, or other activity you can practice until you are good at it. Being good at anything makes you more confident in unrelated things. Once you experience being a beginner at something and then improving, you start to see every skill that you don’t already have as something you can acquire. I also recommend regular exercise as a way to drain off your extra energy and keep your nerves in check. Your fitness level will also directly influence your sense of confidence. If you are fit, you will look more attractive, and that will make you feel more confident in any situation. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=551))

- A PERSON WHO considers ego a reflection of self, instead of a tool that one can dial up or down as needed, has fewer pathways to success. Imagine a potential boss asking if you would be willing to start in a position that is below your current job status but has more potential for growth if you perform well. The person who sees ego as who they are will reject an offer that feels insulting. The person who sees ego as a tool might take that job and have confidence it will lead to something far better.

- Our semi-evolved brains can’t handle all the things that are going right in our world because that would involve consciously processing far more information than we can handle. It makes sense that we evolved this way. If your cave-dwelling ancestors were enamored with the beauty of the scenery instead of, let’s say, the herd of carnivorous dinosaurs stampeding their way, they would not have survived to create the miracle that is you. Are you wondering why the author of this book is so dumb he thinks humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time? I’ll bet many of you noticed that flaw and it captured your attention for a moment. See what I mean? Flaws are sticky. We can’t look away. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=686))

- The obvious downside of our obsession with life’s imperfections is that we can too easily make ourselves crazy. Perhaps that wasn’t such a big problem before the age of smartphones and click-bait media. In olden times, the problems that intruded on people’s thoughts were hyperlocal. Today, we see problems everywhere in the world. Many of them aren’t even real. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=691))

- On top of our instinct to notice problems, the business model of the press involves making you think about everything that is going wrong in the world. It isn’t news if someone does a good job and gets a good outcome. Or at least it isn’t the exciting kind of news that gets clicks. When you combine a human brain that is wired to notice problems with a press that is incentivized to present stories involving huge problems, you can easily start imagining that the world is falling apart in a variety of fatal ways. And that worldview might limit your ability to appreciate all the things going right. We live in a world in which lots of things do go wrong. But if all you see are the flaws in a given situation, you might be cognitively blind to the bigger picture. You have probably seen people who are locked into a belief that everything is going wrong and the future looks bleak.

- Have you ever been angered by someone’s apparent selfishness, sloth, lying, incompetence, rudeness, or criminality and later realized there was a perfectly good reason for whatever they did, and it wasn’t for any of those reasons? That situation describes about half of most people’s experience of life. We’re continually making bad assumptions about why things happened. We humans are a skeptical bunch, and we often think someone or some entity is running a scam on us. Unfortunately, we are often right. But at least half the time, based on my observation, we think a conspiracy exists when there are perfectly normal explanations for events.

- As a rule, we can’t always tell the difference between the people who are far smarter than us and the people who are dumber. Both groups make choices we can’t understand. That’s an important thing to keep in mind. If your opinion is that another person’s idea is terrible, you can only be sure that at least one of you is stupid. You can’t really know which one of you it is except in rare cases in which things can be objectively measured. I find it useful to remember I can’t always tell the difference between genius and stupidity. Neither can anyone else, at least not every time. So when a person who is otherwise smart says something that sounds dumb to me, I remind myself that, in this situation, I might be the dog.

- The more ordinary way people make bad assumptions is by a failure of imagination. Take, for example, my story about fearing instructions at the self-service car wash. If you had not heard my story, and you saw how dirty my car is, you might think the only explanation that makes sense is that it recently got dirty and I’ll be getting it cleaned soon. You would correctly assume I can afford to get my car washed, and over the course of a month, for example, I would have enough time to get it done. And every semi-normal person prefers a clean car to a dirty one. So when you saw my perpetually dirty car, you might think I didn’t wash it because I am too busy, or because I want to preserve water, or because I’m not interested in how my car looks so long as it works. You might come up with a few more reasonable explanations too. The explanation you are unlikely to even imagine is the one that is true: I have an irrational fear of public instructions.

- Life is messy and unpredictable. Sometimes our underpowered and biased brains correctly deduce a chain of cause and effect. But the accuracy of our opinions is deeply influenced by our ability to imagine alternate explanations for events. So what do you do about that? One thing I find helpful is growing old. It’s a slow process, but totally worth it compared to dying. Oldsters such as myself have vastly more experience than the young at being simultaneously wrong and also surprised about it. In time, we come to understand how easy it is to be confident in our opinions and yet spectacularly wrong. Or at least we do if we have been keeping score. And that’s exactly what I recommend doing. Make a mental note every time you find yourself being wrong about something you thought you couldn’t possibly be wrong about. Focusing on your track record can prime you to understand there can be lots of different explanations for a set of facts, and you can’t always think of them all. The failure-of-imagination problem is a risk in every aspect of your ordinary life, from your workplace dramas to your love life. The next time you find yourself generating a belief about why something went wrong, keep in mind that one of the most common explanations for anything in life is something you didn’t imagine.

- One of the strongest walls in our mental prisons is a thing called history. And history isn’t even real. I mean that in two ways. The first way history is not real is that whoever is in charge gets to write history any way they like. And the way they like it is whatever way keeps them in power and looking awesome. That means you should expect the history in one country to be substantially different from the history in another, even when discussing the same events. Which history is the accurate one? Answer: neither. Both are filtered through politics and distorted to the point of being misleading if not outright untrue, except for the basic facts such as names and dates.

- Our tiny brains don’t have the capacity to grasp the complexities of life and then process that knowledge to make smart decisions. We only think we can. What we do instead of rational decision-making is employ a sloppy form of pattern recognition to make sense of our world. There are three important things to know about human beings in order to understand why we do the things we do. Humans use pattern recognition to understand their world. Humans are very bad at pattern recognition. And they don’t know it. We can’t tell the difference between valid patterns that might predict something useful and something that simply reminds us of something else but means nothing. Our meager talents at pattern recognition wouldn’t be much of a problem if we realized how often we see meaning in patterns where none exist. When you expect to be fooled, you can be on the lookout for it. But if you expect the opposite—that you will be wise, correct, and sexy in most situations—you are primed to be fooled.

If “history repeats,” how should I have expected my second book to perform? Just as well as the first? Lots of authors have had bestselling books and then followed up with a second book. You might expect my experience to be similar to that of other authors in my situation. You can probably think of authors who had a huge bestseller and then rode that popularity to create a string of even larger bestsellers. Stephen King, J. K. Rowling, James Patterson, and John Grisham come to mind.

- I published my follow-up book, Dogbert’s Top Secret Management Handbook, and it did well enough to top the nonfiction bestseller list. But overall, it sold about half as many books as the first. Why the heck did history decide to stop repeating just when I needed it??? One day my publisher explained to me that nonfiction books tend to follow the same pattern that mine had. The authors who consistently wrote one bestseller after another were fiction authors. Consumers of fiction want more of the kind of writing they like, only next time with different characters and stories. Consumers of nonfiction books apparently think some version of “I already know what that author has to say.” Especially when the topic seems to be in the same domain as the previous book. The defense against that pattern, for nonfiction writers, is to write books on entirely new topics if the audience lets you get away with it, the way Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis do. I use the same strategy now. One would need to have a lot of publishing experience to know which historical patterns would be the predictive ones in my situation. I thought I knew all I needed to know about how one bestseller leads to more. But I didn’t. We humans are not good at knowing which history is the one that will repeat. Life is messy and complicated, and the situations we encounter often remind us of multiple histories. But which of those histories is the one that is predictive? Consider a person who has been married and divorced twice. If that person gets married again, does history suggest a divorce is likely? Or does history suggest that third marriages are more likely to last than first or second marriages? On top of that, what makes this particular couple typical enough to compare to the average? For example, if one of them is a sex addict, isn’t that a more predictive variable than the third-marriage pattern? Beats me. The point is that we generally have more than one historical pattern in play. And we usually don’t know which ones will be the most predictive. Consider the stock market. That is a bundle of competing histories. You might be looking at the track records of top management. You might be looking at the history of price competition in this market. You might be looking at the history of unexpected innovations. Every company is a collection of patterns. Which ones matter?

- Mark Twain once observed that people can’t tell the difference between good news and bad news. That feels right to me. We usually can’t tell which patterns are most predictive, which means we literally don’t know if we are looking at good news or bad coming our way. But we imagine we can. By now you might be thinking I have overreached in my criticism of the idea that history repeats. Perhaps you can think of situations in which you are absolutely sure history did repeat. But I submit to you that history is very busy, and it does a lot of stuff. You wouldn’t notice all the occasions in which history doesn’t repeat. In fact, if you were sure you noticed history repeating a thousand times, it wouldn’t tell you anything unless you knew how many times it did not repeat when it might have. If that number is a million, your observation of a thousand history-repeating situations is no indication that history repeats. In that scenario, it would be more accurate to say sometimes events remind you of history and sometimes they don’t. It would not be rational to say there is some sort of predictive relationship between unrelated historical anecdotes and whatever you are doing today. And when you do see history apparently repeating, ask yourself if you needed to know history to make your prediction.

- Whenever humans have an opportunity to do something illegal that would have a huge payoff should it work, and no risk of getting caught, the odds of someone doing that illegal thing approach 100 percent. Not everyone will take the bait, but if enough people are in that situation, you can be sure at least one will take a run at the free money with no risk, even if it means breaking a law. You might say that’s a case of history repeating, because whenever that situation occurs, sooner or later someone will try to take advantage. But here again we need no special knowledge of history to make our predictions. You simply have to understand the dark side of human nature. For the nitpickers reading this chapter, I acknowledge that we only understand human nature because we observe how people have acted throughout history. History gives us useful insight on how humans act. But that insight is useful only in simple cases. Will people who are hungry seek food? Yes. Will people exploit loopholes for personal gain? Yes. Will people lie if they think it helps a lot and they can get away with it? Yes. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=987))

If there are no offsetting forces, then yes, things will keep going in one direction forever. But that’s rare. Usually a counterforce pops up as a reaction, or it is already in place.

- Humans probably don’t have a biological need for much privacy. We are tribal creatures, meaning we evolved in environments in which the tribe knows everything about you, whether you like it or not. Privacy seems to be more of a modern invention. Most of us appreciate having privacy in a variety of situations. But it’s not likely that our preference for privacy is compatible with our nature. Consider that humans also enjoy drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol. Just because we prefer something, that doesn’t make it good for us. Privacy has real-world benefits, and I don’t recommend you give it up without a fight. But if your desire for some specific forms of privacy is fear based, you might be creating a mental prison for yourself that you don’t want. I think most people would agree that the pivotal step in the advancement of gay rights involved brave activists “coming out” about their sexual orientation and making it safe, in time, for others to do so. You could say the LGBTQ community traded privacy for equality. They didn’t give up all of their privacy—only the part that kept them in a social prison. That’s the clearest historical example of privacy being more of a problem than a solution. Once the LGBTQ community embraced that truth—that privacy was their prison, not their protection—they had a path out. It wasn’t easy, and it might never be easy. But it’s a winning path.

- We humans have a reflexive distaste for inaccuracy and lies. And we dislike people who traffic in such factual inaccuracies. That makes perfect sense, because we evolved as social creatures. Trust is the glue that holds social groups together. We are hardwired to prefer the truth. The catch is that any leader who hopes to move the minds of the public will soon learn their facts and reason are poor tools for doing so. I describe this phenomenon more completely in my book Win Bigly. The gist of it is that humans are irrational creatures who mistakenly believe they use logic and reason to arrive at decisions. The reality, which science has proven in lots of different ways, is that we routinely make irrational decisions and then try to rationalize them. That’s why the people who disagree with you so often appear to be not just wrong, but totally bonkers. And importantly, they think exactly the same about you.1 It’s easy to tell when another person is rationalizing (as opposed to being rational), but it is nearly impossible to know when you are doing it yourself. That’s why most of the social and political disagreements you see involve two or more idiots pointing at each other and screeching some form of “YOU IDIOT!” Both sides are right about the other being irrational, but wrong about themselves being rational.

- One of my systems involves blogging and livestreaming on a variety of topics, then monitoring audience reaction to see where I should focus my energy. That system, which I have used for years, caused me to evolve from a cartoonist into a political pundit with a special focus on persuasion. There was no way I could have predicted that outcome. I simply continued adding skills to my skill stack while testing different messages and topics until something I was doing excited the audience. This was where it ended up. As part of that journey, I built a large following on Twitter, and as a result got to see more examples of loserthink than I ever imagined possible. When I combined my new understanding of the most common forms of faulty thinking on social media with my writing skills and my general media skills, it brought you and me together over this book. None of this was predictable, except in the general sense that having good systems kicks up opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise know existed.

- What do all these coincidences mean? Absolutely nothing. Coincidences happen all the time. But we humans are wired to put meaning on coincidences, and when we do, we are often engaged in loserthink. To be fair, sometimes coincidences do mean something. If the police are investigating a domestic murder, and the surviving spouse booked a flight out of the country right before it happened, that might not be a coincidence at all. But the far more typical situation is when we think a coincidence means something and it doesn’t. We are surrounded by coincidences. Most mean nothing at all. The most common situations in which coincidences can be misleading involve your career and your personal life. When the topic has an emotional element, and you are already primed to believe something to be true, expect the environment to serve up lots of false signals.

- German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi—whose parents were not good at naming babies—was known for his maxim that it is often easier to solve a problem if you express it as its opposite.1 Famous investor Charlie Munger, best known as Warren Buffett’s business partner, uses a version of this method to look at investments; instead of asking how they might succeed, he first tries to understand what failing would look like in this situation, and how to avoid it.2 As a cartoonist, one of my writing techniques involves considering common situations and asking myself what it would look like if my assumptions were exactly backward. For example, we assume our doctors want to heal us and they try hard to do so. But for comic purposes, it is funnier to imagine the opposite, that the doctor is a serial killer who found a legal way to pursue his hobby. Now all he does is dispense bad medical advice. I do this mental exercise of reversing reality often as part of my work, and so I reflexively do it with topics I see in the news, my personal life, and everywhere else. Usually, things are not the opposite of how they look, but it helps to be on the lookout for times when that is the case. Have you ever suspected a loved one was trying to do something bad to you and later discovered they were trying to do you a favor? If you lock yourself into the first theory before discovering you are wrong, much damage can be done before you learn the truth. But if your first reflex is to ask yourself what if the opposite of the first impression is true, you’re on safer ground. Often it helps to hold both your suspicion and the opposite of your suspicion as equally possible until you know for sure. The way human minds are wired, if we take a firm position on a topic, we are unlikely to change our minds even when facts emerge that debunk our initial belief. That’s why it is smarter to not commit to a firm opinion when facts are still coming into focus. My mantra in these situations is: But I could be totally wrong. That gives me the mental freedom to later adjust my opinion if needed. Always ask yourself if the opposite of your theory could be true. Doing so keeps you humble and less susceptible to bias until you get to the truth of the situation. ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=1346))

- My nomination for the most loserthinkish advice in history is: “Stay in your lane.” That is the sort of advice that is better served to an enemy, not a friend. If everyone followed that advice, you wouldn’t have civilization. The world as we know it was engineered, designed, and built by people who left their lane and tried something outside their temporary skill stack. They figured it out as they went. I’ll agree that one size doesn’t fit all, and some people probably should stick to what they do best. But I wouldn’t want society to decide that staying in one lane is some sort of obvious wisdom. In my experience, the smartest plan for life is to leave your lane as often as you can (without inviting major risk) to pick up skills that will complement your talent stack. The more skills you have, the more valuable you will be, although you won’t necessarily know in advance where it will take you. If you happen to be one of the best in the world at some specific skill, such as sports, music, or science—and you like what you do—it might make perfect sense to “stay in your lane” and milk that situation for all it is worth. But most of us are not the best in the world, or anywhere near it, at any particular skill. If that describes you, I recommend leaving your lane often—even at the risk of embarrassment—to pick up new skills and new ways to see the world.

- The best way to widen your lane is to leave it often, so you can learn something new. I prefer picking projects in which I will come out ahead no matter what kind of luck I have. If I learn some useful new skills, and I make some valuable contacts, and I learn to see the world through the filter of the new skill, I know I have become more valuable and my lane has widened. Leaving your lane and learning a new skill can be deeply rewarding. The experience of struggling to learn a new skill and then mastering it over time can be a big boost to your confidence. And it is the best way to remind yourself you can prevail in hard situations. Two of my favorite sentences are . . . I don’t know how to do that. But I can figure it out.

- One of the fringe benefits of being mildly famous is that I meet a lot of successful entrepreneurs. I also know lots of people who have failed so often it seems intentional. If I had to pick one defining characteristic that separates the successful from the unsuccessful, it would be luck. But if I had to pick two defining characteristics, the other one would be a sense of control. Successful people, and people who will someday be successful, seem to believe they can steer their fate by their actions. Whether they are right about that or not, it’s a winning mindset. People who think they control their situations will put more effort into doing so. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=1493))

- When you spend time every day doing something productive, whether that involves learning something useful or exercising, for example, you gain a sense of control over your reality. And that sense of control can be both motivating and satisfying, which helps you do more of what works. At the other extreme, people who are consistently unsuccessful often believe they are victims of life, although the details of that victimhood can differ. Think of the people you know who are consistently late for everything. Do they blame themselves? Sometimes, yes. But usually they tell you traffic was bad or something came up that was out of their control. Now talk to the people who are always five minutes early no matter what. That group believes timeliness is about 90 percent under their control. And that kind of belief is a strong predictor of success. You can figure out which group you are in by asking yourself what is keeping you from achieving your objectives in life. Is the first answer that comes to mind something about your own efforts? Or did you immediately think about an obstacle that life has put in your way? If you take full responsibility for your outcomes, even while knowing much of it depends on luck, that’s how rich people think. If you blame something beyond your direct control, you’re probably engaged in loserthink, and your outcomes will reflect it. Now let me talk directly to the people who would like to be successful in life but are “thinking like poor people.” And by that I mean you believe you are not the primary authors of your own life experience. The place to start is by changing that mindset. If you don’t fix that first, don’t expect anything else to work out for you. I think nearly every successful person would agree with me on this point: get your mind right first. Everything else depends on that.

Our consistent wrongness has a lot to do with the fact that the world is a complicated place and it is hard to predict what will happen next. Yet we are continually forced to predict the future in both big and small ways because otherwise we wouldn’t know what we should be doing at any given moment. We get the easy stuff right, such as knowing we’ll want a beverage if we eat pretzels. But when it comes to the big, complicated, long-term predictions, we’re not equipped with the psychic powers required to know how the future turns out.

- People who have been trained in decision-making understand that you can’t evaluate things in isolation. The only way to know how well President Trump handled the hurricane in Puerto Rico is to compare it to how the other people who were president at the same time in a parallel world handled their Puerto Rico hurricanes, with all variables the same except the president. Obviously that comparison can’t be made because we had only one president and one Hurricane Maria striking Puerto Rico in 2017, and that was after two major hurricanes had already stretched FEMA’s emergency resources just weeks earlier. There is no rational way to know if the Trump administration did a great job or a poor job. You can only describe what happened, and even that probably lacks complete context. Anticipating your objections to this point, I agree that if Trump acted in ways that were obviously crazy and unproductive, we would know for sure he was doing it wrong. But within the scope of normal(ish) behavior, you can’t know for sure that some other president would have performed better.

- Humans apparently evolved to prefer fairness in situations where they don’t have the option of being on top. And that’s most situations. But as a practical matter, fairness is an impossible standard, because it is always a matter of opinion. The closest we can come to fairness involves applying the law equally to all citizens. Fairness beyond that is generally out of reach because what looks fair to me might not look so fair to you. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=1961))

- You often hear political leaders argue for fairness. Their job is to persuade, so that makes sense. Politicians are advocates for their constituents, not referees for fairness. If your job is to persuade, arguing for fairness can be an effective approach because humans are spring-loaded to prefer fairness. But in everyday life, fairness is an illusion, and complaining about the lack of fairness is rarely productive.

- Patterns, and the analogies that often include them, are a form of what I call feels-the-same, meaning humans see patterns in lots of things, and those patterns might remind us of other things. But that’s all patterns usually mean. If you think an analogy is helping you predict the future, you might be in a mental prison. Analogies don’t have that power. To predict the future, look for causation, not patterns. If you are making near-term predictions based on causation, you might have an accurate view of the world. But if your prediction is based on pattern alone, you are probably in a mental prison. And your jailers are the people who try to dupe you with patterns that mean nothing. I manufactured a meaningless pattern with the bug-eye photos. Your preferred news source intentionally manufactures fake patterns almost every day. Fake patterns add color and interest to boring news stories. I often say on social media, and elsewhere, that analogies are useless for persuasion. Analogies are also useless for predicting what happens next, especially if the analogies are of the “history repeats” type. Analogies are great when used for humor. They are also handy for describing a new concept. But I try to avoid using analogies in the service of persuasion or prediction because analogies are not good for that. The target of your persuasion will simply pick it apart for not being exactly the same as the situation you are debating. If you live to be a million, you’ll never see anyone win a debate with an analogy. Good use of an analogy (describing something): His posture reminded me of macaroni. Bad use of an analogy (persuasion and prediction): We should disband the U.S. Postal Service because the Hitler Youth movement started with cool uniforms too. That’s where it’s all headed. As bad as analogies are for persuading, they are even worse for predicting. If someone tells you a male lion looks like a gigantic tan-colored house cat with a neck beard, it doesn’t help you predict how the lion will work out as a house pet. If you find that your best argument depends on the predictive or persuasive characteristics of analogies, you are likely in a mental prison of your own making.

It is also about freedom, self-defense, sporting, and, for some people, an insurance policy against a government that turns on its people. Those are all important issues. But it is not productive to say gun control “doesn’t work” when we observe friction working whenever it is introduced, including with guns. Adding friction to any human choice will reduce the number of people making that choice. To assume otherwise is loserthink.

- One of the best mental habits you can develop is to think in positive terms even when you don’t feel positive.2 For example, I was a negative person in my twenties, but I didn’t know it. I thought I was humorously pointing out the flaws in everything around me. I wasn’t aware of how damaging it was to the people who had to listen to it. Nor did I realize how the negativity affected my own sense of happiness. Dwelling on the negative is expensive in terms of your social life, your mental health, and even your career success. People like to be around positive people, for all the right reasons. One day a friend explained to me with brutal honesty (alcohol might have been involved) that I was too negative and it was a drag. I was surprised to hear that my continuous complaining about just about everything wasn’t being well received by the people I liked most. So I set out to change that with a simple technique that I borrowed from another friend: if I need to talk about something negative, I pair it with at least one positive thought. I’ve made such a habit of this over the years that I feel uncomfortable expressing pure criticisms without a healthy dollop of optimism about something—anything—to balance things out. My original loserthink approach involved complaining any time I was in the mood to do so, under the theory that I was just being me. In my complaining years, I didn’t realize I was grinding away on the positive feelings of friends, romantic partners, and coworkers. Now I realize I have a choice not only about how others perceive me but also in creating myself. If I don’t want to be a negative person, I simply remind myself to consider the positive in situations as often as I can. Once it becomes habit to do so, that’s the person I have become. And I like that person. Never be yourself if you can make yourself into something better through your conscious actions. You are what you do.

- Four-Point Check: News that is true will generally be reported the same on right-leaning news sites Fox News and Breitbart, as well as on left-leaning CNN and MSNBC. If they all say a hurricane is heading your way, pack your bags. If only the right-leaning news sites or only the left-leaning news outlets report something as fact, it probably isn’t. Team Bias: The “side” that is out of power is more likely to generate fake news. When President Obama was in office, Fox News told you he was destroying the country in a thousand ways. CNN was a bit more balanced about President Obama, and more likely to talk of his accomplishments. Under President Trump, CNN pivoted to nonstop negativity about Trump’s performance, and Fox News became more of a cheerleader. The news outlet whose political side is out of power does the most fearmongering because that’s what sells to their viewers. The side that has its preferred president in power has the advantage of being able to point to some accomplishments over time, even if they have to exaggerate to do so.

Doom Predictions: Look for signs that the reported bad news is really a prediction of doom from someone who is a political partisan. Predictions of doom from cheerleaders for one team or another are almost always exaggerated. Manufactured Outrages: Look for signs that pundits are actively misinterpreting, or taking out of context, someone’s comments that would have been no big scandal without the devious sleight of hand. Absurdity: If you see news that is so absurd it is literally unbelievable, that’s usually because it isn’t true. The old saying in the news business is that a dog biting a man is not news, but a man biting a dog is. It would be highly unusual for a man to bite a dog, but one could imagine it happening in our crazy world. So that doesn’t qualify as absurd, just unlikely. The absurd case would be a story about a pet cemetery located near a nuclear waste site that reanimated a dead dog that went on to bite someone. Fog of War: For breaking news, don’t believe the first quotes you hear, the body counts, the implications for the future, whose fault it is, or much else about the story until some of the noise settles down.

- CHANGE WHAT YOU DO TO CHANGE HOW YOU THINK Your brain makes decisions and causes your body to do whatever it is you decide to do. But it also works the other way, and that is an important tool for escaping your mental prisons. You can change how you think by changing what your body is doing. In the simplest example, if you travel and talk to people from different cultures, the relocation of your body helps a great deal to expand your mind. You have probably noticed how radically your mood and your thoughts can change after exercise, eating, and even having sex. And if you don’t get enough sleep, you know your thoughts take a different path than if you did. One of the most important conceptual shifts you can make is the realization that you can program your thoughts and your attitudes by taking care of your health and fitness. How many times have you considered a challenge and decided it was too overwhelming to take on because you were tired, hungry, or physically weak? And how many times have you noticed that being in good health with lots of energy persuades you to take on bigger challenges and more risks of nonlethal embarrassment? I’m describing most of you. If you want to think more effectively, make sure you manage your body in a way that gets you there. Learn to eat right and exercise right. Treat sleep as a learned skill. Those topics are beyond the scope of this book, but you would do well to read my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big to learn how to create simple systems to get all of that done.

- Hallucinations generally involve adding imaginary things to the environment. For example, if you think you see ghosts, UFOs, or Bigfoot, you are imagining them added to the existing scenery. What you rarely or never see is a hallucination that subtracts something from the existing reality. For example, you never hear of people hallucinating that the furniture in their homes is missing when it is actually still there right in front of their eyes. So if you and other people are looking at the same evidence in the same place at the same time, and you can clearly see something the rest do not see, the problem is probably on your end. Here I am not talking about interpretations of data. I’m talking about seeing something as clearly as the hand in front of your face.

That’s why I often say you can’t look at the past, or even the present, to know the truth about your reality, because it is easy to fit different theories to the same set of observations. If you want to test the validity of your worldview, it isn’t good enough that the facts in evidence are consistent with your theory of events. Multiple theories can meet that standard. The only practical way to test your worldview is to see how well it predicts.

If members of your group discourage you from listening to opposing views, it’s time to plan your escape. ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=2910))

- In my experience, perhaps 90 percent of the people who think they are disagreeing with me are only disagreeing with their own misinterpretation of my opinion. When you find yourself in a similar situation, as I am sure you sometimes do, I recommend using something I call the Magic Question.

- The most effective approach to addressing critics who misinterpret you, and then criticize their own misinterpretation as if it came from you, is this challenge: ([Location 2937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=2937))

- I’ve been testing this question on social media for a year, and it works great. If you let your critic focus on his hallucinations about your opinion, you will get nowhere. But if you change the focus to the critic’s opinion, it puts you in control of the conversation. In other words, you flip the conversation from artificial disagreement, in which your critic imagines crazy opinions for you and then debunks them, to one in which the critic is stating his opinion and you are agreeing.

- In my experience, if someone has up to three reasons for an opinion, that person might have a strong case. But people who present laundry lists of ten reasons rarely have a strong case. I can’t say this rule of thumb is predictive every time, but you can easily test the validity of a person’s laundry list with this request: Give me the strongest argument or evidence on your list that supports your point. Just one, please. Your critic will usually smell a trap, resist your request, and demand that you consider all the damning evidence on the laundry list. Here’s how to reply: In the interest of time, would you agree that if I can debunk your strongest point, you should rethink all of your points that are weaker than the one I debunk?

- Don’t play Whac-A-Mole with people who have laundry lists of reasons supporting their hallucinations. Ask for their strongest point only, and debunk it if you can. Target their undue confidence, not their entire laundry list. ([Location 2970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=2970))

- If you are debating a topic in the news, I find it helpful to start by noting that all news sources are unreliable at least sometimes. Most people will agree with that as a general statement. Once you have established that high-ground truth, you have set the table for persuasion. Remember, your objective is to weaken the other person’s confidence in their sources of information, and in so doing weaken the walls of their mental prison. Agree with people as much as you can without lying, and you will be in a better position to persuade. ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=2976))

- One of the ways people lock themselves in mental prisons is by not differentiating between the things that matter and the things that do not. I blame the news and social media for that, because unimportant news can often be the most entertaining and most profitable. Our human instinct is to assume that whatever subject we think about the most must also be the most important. That is backward, of course, because we should be picking the most important topics to think about the most. The business model of the news industry and the design of social media almost guarantee we will be thinking the most about the least important topics.

- Don’t argue in the weeds of a debate. Dismiss the trivial stuff and concentrate on the variables that matter. That gives you the high ground. ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=2996))

- Ask people with opposing opinions to describe what the future would look like if their view of the world were to play out. Does it sound reasonable? ([Location 3003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=3003))

- In an earlier chapter, I talked about how often we assume (incorrectly) that we can read the minds of others. I have observed over the past few years that when I point out that someone is forming an opinion based on what they believe to be their ability to read minds, they will often drop their confidence levels right away. If it doesn’t happen immediately after you cleverly label their behavior as mind reading, try this next: ask how many times in their personal relationships their mates or friends have incorrectly assumed what they were thinking. This approach hits people hard. We all know it is common for the people who know us best to misinterpret our thoughts and intentions. So what are the odds we can accurately deduce the inner thoughts and intentions of total strangers? ([Location 3006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=3006))

- This is as good a place as any to remind you that I make almost every loserthink mistake in this book, and routinely. But I am also sure I am reducing my rate of loserthink over time simply because I focus on it. I expect you will have the same experience after reading this book.

- The best way to avoid the mind reading illusion is to look for it in others. That will prime you to better catch yourself when you do your own mind reading. ([Location 3019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P8J8YB6&location=3019))

- If you ask the wrong question, you usually get the wrong answer. The same is true for how you frame an issue. If you frame it correctly, you have a better chance of understanding it and dealing with it effectively. In the world of politics, partisans frame things for selfish gain, not for solutions.

- I’ll say one more time that I have made every mistake in this book, usually more than once. If you follow me on Twitter, at @ScottAdamsSays, you’ll see me making some of these mistakes again, but you will also see people correcting me. That delights me and helps me at the same time.

- Science tells us that people retain only a small part of what they learn, so I will close by telling you which parts you should try hardest to remember. THINGS TO REMEMBER Don’t engage in mind reading. It isn’t a human skill. Think of your ego as a tool, not your identity. Track your predictions to build up some useful humility about your worldview. Put yourself in embarrassing situations regularly to teach yourself there is no lasting pain. The past no longer exists. Don’t let your attachment to the past influence your decisions today. If you haven’t mentioned the next best alternative to your proposed plan, you haven’t said anything at all, and smart people would be wise to ignore you.

- If you are arguing over the definition of a word instead of the best way forward, you are not part of the productive world. If you are sure one variable is all you need to grasp a complicated topic, the problem is probably on your end. Occam’s razor (the idea that the simplest explanation is usually correct) is utter nonsense in the way it is commonly employed. We all think our opinions are the simplest explanations. Fairness cannot be obtained in most cases because of its subjective nature. The closest you can get is equal application of the law. If your argument depends on that one time something happened, you do not have an argument. You have a story. If your argument depends entirely on the so-called slippery slope, you don’t have much of an argument. Everything changes until there’s a reason for it to stop. Mowing your lawn is not a slippery slope to shaving your dog. Coincidences usually mean nothing. And they are the fuel of confirmation bias. If your argument depends entirely on not knowing how else to explain coincidences, you have a poor imagination, not an argument. Coincidences might tell you where to look first for confirmation of a theory, but that is as far as they can go. Avoid halfpinions that ignore either the costs or the benefits of a plan. Don’t use analogies to predict. Look to causes and effects. Don’t judge a group by its worst 5 percent. If you do, you’re probably in the worst 5 percent of your own group. Understand the limits of expert advice, and be skeptical of experts who have financial incentives to mislead.
