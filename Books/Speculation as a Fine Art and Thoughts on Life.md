## Highlights
- Is there any difference between speculation and gambling? The terms are often used interchangeably, but speculation presupposes intellectual effort; gambling, blind chance. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=49))

- Speculation is a venture based upon calculation. Gambling is a venture without calculation. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=53))

- All business is more or less speculation. The term speculation, however, is commonly restricted to business of exceptional uncertainty. The uninitiated believe that chance is so large a part of speculation that it is subject to no rules, is governed by no laws.

- This is a serious error. We propose in this article to point out some of the laws in this realm. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=58))

- Let us first consider the qualities essential to the equipment of the speculator. We name them: Self-reliance, judgment, courage, prudence, pliability.   Self-Reliance A man must think for himself, must follow his own convictions. George MacDonald says: “A man cannot have another man’s ideas any more than he can another man’s soul or another man’s body.” Self-trust is the foundation of successful effort. Judgment That equipoise, that nice adjustment of the faculties one to the other, which is called good judgment, is an essential to the speculator. Courage That is, confidence to act on the decisions of the mind. In speculation there is value in Mirabeau’s dictum: “Be bold, still be bold; always be bold.” ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=63))

- Prudence The power of measuring the danger, together with a certain alertness and watchfulness, is very important. There should be a balance of these two, Prudence and Courage; Prudence in contemplation, Courage in execution. Lord Bacon says: “In meditation all dangers should be seen; in execution one, unless very formidable.” Connected with these qualities, properly an outgrowth of them, is a third, viz: promptness. The mind convinced, the act should follow. In the words of Macbeth; “Henceforth the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand.” Think, act, promptly. Pliability The ability to change an opinion, the power of revision. “He who observes,” says Emerson, “and observes again, is always formidable.” The qualifications named are necessary to the makeup of a speculator, but they must be in well-balanced combination. A deficiency or an overplus of one quality will destroy the effectiveness of all. The possession of such faculties, in a proper adjustment is, of course, uncommon. In speculation, as in life, few succeed, many fail. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=74))

- When Doubtful, Reduce The Amount Of The Interest For either the mind is not satisfied with the position taken, or the interest is too large for safety. One man told another that he could not sleep on account of his position in the market; ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0045UABFU&location=103))
