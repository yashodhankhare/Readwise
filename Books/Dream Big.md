- Here in this preface, I would like to share the top 10 lessons I have gleaned from watching, teaching, and learning from their journey.   1) INVEST ALWAYS – AND ABOVE ALL – IN PEOPLE. The founders certainly have a strong dose of financial genius, but that is not the primary source of their success. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=43))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- From the very beginning, their primary investments have been in people, especially young and talented leaders. Their philosophy: Better to give talented (if unproven) people a chance, and endure a few disappointments along the way, than to not believe in people. The number one ingredient in their secret sauce is an obsession with getting the right people, investing in those people… ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=47))

- sheer joy and exhilaration of achieving a big dream together. And, just as important, stay with your proven people for a long time. It’s interesting to note that the three founders have worked together for four decades, and are as unified as ever. And many of the best young people they brought into this system have stayed passionately involved for decades, such as the current CEO Carlos… ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=50))

- very long time.   2) SUSTAIN MOMENTUM WITH A BIG DREAM. Great people need big things to do, or they will take their creative energies elsewhere. So, the founders built a two-piston flywheel: First, get great people; second, give them big things to do; then, get more great people, and come up with the next big thing to do; then repeat, again and again. This is how they sustained momentum over time. They always resonated with the idea of BHAGs – Big Hairy Audacious Goals – and built a culture to achieve them. Watching them, I learned that sustaining momentum, and therefore retaining great people, is worth the inherent risks of pursuing big goals. It’s like a great mountain-climbing team; on the one hand, there is inherent risk in doing one big mountain,… ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=53))

- best mountain climbers. Great climbers need big mountains to climb, always and forever.   3) CREATE A MERITOCRATIC OWNERSHIP CULTURE WITH ALIGNED INCENTIVES. The founders built a consistent culture that gave people the opportunity to share in the rewards of the big dream. The culture valued performance, not status; achievement, not age; contribution, not position; talent, not… ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=61))

- 4) YOU CAN EXPORT A GREAT CULTURE ACROSS WIDELY DIVERGENT INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES. The truly remarkable thing is how the Dream-People-Culture model carried from investment banking and finance into beer, from Brazil to all of Latin America, then to Europe and the United States, and now expanding all over the world. For Lemann, Telles and Sicupira, culture is not in support of strategy; culture is strategy. The three partners have always held to their core values and distinctive culture, while continually growing into new industries, expanding across geographies, and pointing towards ever bigger goals – a beautiful example of the underlying dynamic, “Preserve the Core and Stimulate Progress” exemplified by any enduring great company. There is a corollary to this lesson: you can “predict the… ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=69))

- they would act aggressively to import the best United States practices, and do so early.   5) FOCUS ON CREATING SOMETHING GREAT, NOT ON “MANAGING MONEY.” The three founders came of age during a tumultuous economic time in Brazil, and I once asked: “What did you learn about how to manage money in such uncertain and inflationary times?” The answer: “When everyone else was spending their time managing their money, we invested our… ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=76))

- transaction, but rather as another step in building the company. They stand as the antithesis of a built to flip mentality; it is always about being built to last.   6) SIMPLICITY HAS GENIUS AND MAGIC IN IT. On almost every dimension, the three founders exemplified simplicity. They have very simple dress; you would not notice them in a crowd. They kept simple offices, never walling themselves off from their people in an executive suite. They used their increasing wealth not for opulence, but to simplify their lives, so they could focus on continuing to build the company. (I learned that the best sign of true wealth is an uncluttered calendar, with time available to focus on the most important priorities.) And their entre strategy is so simple: Get great people, give them big things to do and sustain a meritocratic ownership culture.… ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=84))

It happened because everyone involved had one goal: to do what’s best to make a great and enduring company. They all embraced the Dream-People-Culture philosophy, and navigated the financial crisis of 2008-09 as a completely unified group. In the United States, most boards are benign, and the power resides primarily with the chief executive; boards tend to only become significant when it comes time to replace a failing CEO.

- “It’s not about thinking ‘if I win a million dollars or a billion dollars, the game is over,’” said Buffett. “That’s because after a certain point, money is of no more use.” Despite their close relationship, Buffett said he had been taken by surprise by the Brazilians’ offer for AB: “I thought that he would do it one day, but did not know it would be at that moment. It was an enormous step at a completely hostile time. There was one moment when I honestly did not think the deal would go ahead. It was the only transaction of that size at that time... My decision was to evaluate whether, against that backdrop, the share price would rise or not and whether the deal would really be made despite the crisis. I then sold a part of my stake which annoyed some people. I didn’t know how the AB board worked. I had met the Fourth only once at a baseball game and spoken personally to the Third about 15 years earlier.

I liked the company and we had been part of it for many years... It would be difficult to lose money there just as it would be difficult to make any great gain. It was a solid option, but nothing particularly exciting.” ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=365))

- worked with InBev’s controlling partners for many years. He was an economist and joined Brahma in 1990. He had been CFO since 2005. Dutra was detail–oriented and had established an aggressive set of conditions in the contract with the 10 banks involved in the deal – Santander, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Fortis, ING Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Corporate Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. His greatest triumph was to successfully exclude a clause known as the Material Adverse Change (MAC), which guarantees the institutions the right to renegotiate the financing conditions in the event of any sudden worsening of the situation. As the banks did not have this clause in the contracts, they were obliged to adhere to all the conditions to which they had agreed before the crisis broke out and they were legally prevented from abandoning ship.

My dreams, which had been to win a tennis championship or surf bigger waves, became larger. People who know me and my companies know that I always say that, ‘having a big dream brings as much work as having a small dream’... The other thing I learned at Harvard, and has become part of my nature, was the importance of choosing people. I was among the best people in the world there. Excellence was all around. This had a great influence on how I started to choose people, which has been one of the main features of my career... “Harvard also taught me to focus on a way of obtaining ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=506))

- much as that of Goldman Sachs. The American bank was founded in New York in 1869 by German Jew Marcus Goldman, his son in law, Samuel Sachs, entering the firm three years later. The company became the most influential and powerful investment bank in the world. Charles D. Ellis, the author of the book The Partnership – The Making of Goldman Sachs, reveals some of its main features:   ‘Goldman Sachs was a total meritocracy. Mr. Weinberg [Sidney Weinberg, who for decades was the leading partner at the bank] tolerated none of the politics or infighting that hurt so many of the other firms. (…) One use of that power was to keep payouts to partners low, forcing them to build up equity in the firm. ‘Sidney Weinberg set the policy on tough capital retention,’ says partner Peter Sacerdote. ‘It was good for the firm because it made everyone focus always on what was best ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JUWYGDQ&location=683))

The difficulties were enormous, even at Brahma, which had undergone a culture shock with the arrival of the Garantia team. Falconi recalled how the brewer was when he entered it for the first time 20 years earlier:   “Brahma was a madhouse like all companies in Brazil then... There were no standards whatsoever. Every plant was different, every day was different... The beer varied and there was no difference between one brand and another...

He asked for a bottle of beer from every Brahma plant, each of which had to have been produced on the same day and time. For the sake of comparison, bottles from competitors bought in the same towns where Brahma had plants were also separated. The result was alarming: each plant produced a different final product. The final straw was the test carried out at what was regarded as the company’s most efficient plant. A bottle was taken from the production line every hour throughout the entire day. When it was analyzed, it was shown that the characteristics of the bottled beer differed considerably over a single day even in the same plant.

After 27 years working in the bank he had founded, he now had to redefine his role in the investments he held with his partners.

He preferred to install himself in the office of GP Investimentos, the private equity firm the three former bankers had founded in 1993.

- Garantia Partners.) Ironically, Lehmann would remain, physically, very close to the bank he had just sold. The head offices of Garantia and GP were located at number 3,064 Avenida Brigadeiro Faria Lima in São Paulo – with the bank on the 13th floor and the private equity firm on the floor underneath. Despite Lemann’s presence in the office, GP’s daily operations were run by Sicupira, who had gotten the firm up and running five years earlier. When the company was set up, the private equity sector simply did not exist in Brazil. Sicupira had to explain to investors what it was all about – buying companies that were experiencing hard times, improving their earnings and selling them at a profit some years later to other investors or by listing them on the stock exchange. To set up the first fund, he had to try to raise money in Brazil and abroad. He made 40 trips to the US in one year, all on commercial flights – private jets were not part of his world. His pilgrimage resulted in funding of US$ 500 million – US$ 100 million of which came from the Garantia partners’, mainly the three bankers’, own pockets. Sicupira used the experience he and his partners had acquired running companies like Brahma and Lojas Americanas to attract investors. While most foreign private equity funds were only involved in the financial aspects of the businesses they acquired, GP’s policy was to take a direct hand in the management.

(He is now studying economics at Columbia University in New York.) He was excited by what he saw and made a short presentation to the 3G team in which he recommended they buy shares in the company, which, at the time, were trading at less than US$ 40. However, instead of following the boy’s opinion, the 3G partners preferred to buy shares in other companies in the food and drinks area. Three years went by before 3G finally advanced on Heinz.
