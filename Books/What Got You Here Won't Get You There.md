## Highlights
- Why does this happen? More often than not, it’s because people’s inner compass of correct behavior has gone out of whack—and they become clueless about their position among their coworkers. In an article that ran in The New Yorker, film director Harold Ramis commented on the reasons behind the fading career of Chevy Chase, one of the stars of Ramis’s Caddyshack. Ramis said, “Do you know the concept of proprioception, of how you know where you are and where you’re oriented? Chevy lost his sense of proprioception, lost touch with what he was projecting to people. It’s strange because you couldn’t write Chevy as a character in a novel, because his whole attitude is just superiority: ‘I’m Chevy Chase and you’re not.’” ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=225))

- Overcommitment can be as serious an obstacle to change as believing that you don’t need fixing or that your flaws are part of the reason you’re successful. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=503))

- You see the difference in any job, even where money is not related to performance. When I attended high school back in Kentucky, even a skeptical wise-cracking jokester like me could see that some teachers had a calling for the profession and some teachers did it to make a living—and the best teachers were the former. They were committed to us rather than being controlled by external forces (such as a paycheck). ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=508))

- The more we believe that our behavior is a result of our own choices and commitments, the less likely we are to want to change our behavior. There’s a reason for this, and it’s one of the best-researched principles in psychology. It’s called cognitive dissonance. It refers to the disconnect between what we believe in our minds and what we experience or see in reality. The underlying theory is simple. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of clear evidence that shows we are wrong. For example, if you believe your colleague Bill is a jerk, you will filter Bill’s actions through that belief. No matter what Bill does, you’ll see it through a prism that confirms he’s a jerk. Even the times when he’s not a jerk, you’ll interpret it as the exception to the rule that Bill’s a jerk. It may take years of saintly behavior for Bill to overcome your perception. That’s cognitive dissonance applied to others. It can be a disruptive and unfair force in the workplace. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=518))

- Yet cognitive dissonance actually works in favor of successful people when they apply it to themselves. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of evidence that shows we may have chosen the wrong path. It’s the reason successful people don’t buckle and waver when times get tough. Their commitment to their goals and beliefs allows them to view reality through rose-tinted glasses. That’s a good thing in many situations. Their personal commitment encourages people to “stay the course” and to not give up when the going gets tough. Of course, this same steadfastness can work against successful people when they should change course. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=526))

- Superstition is merely the confusion of correlation and causality. Any human, like any animal, tends to repeat behavior that is followed by positive reinforcement. The more we achieve, the more reinforcement we get. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=549))

- But then Harry went into defensive reaction number two: fear of overcorrection. He was concerned that he might start listening too much and that doing so would diminish his creative impulses. He would become too unwilling to share his opinions and eventually dry up creatively. I pointed out that the danger that a 55-year-old man who had been a bad listener for his entire life would overcorrect and suddenly become excessively ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=586))

- interested in other people’s opinions was extremely remote. I assured him that he could remove this concern from his things-to-worry-about list. We were fixing one bad behavior, not manufacturing a religious conversion. Ultimately Harry decided it was more productive to hear people out than waste time justifying his own dysfunctional behavior.

- Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC/Interactive Corp., was at Harvard Business School explaining the rationale behind the mosaic of interactive commerce companies he had assembled at IAC, such as Ticketmaster, Hotels.com., Match.com, and LendingTree.com. One of the students pointed out that these various businesses seemed to be operating independently, not in a coordinated synergistic fashion. Diller erupted in mock anger. “Don’t ever use that word synergy. It’s a hideous word,” he said. “The only thing that works is natural law. Given enough time, natural relationships will develop between our businesses.” ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=611))

- and (oh yes) a state-of-the-art sound system providing round-the-clock background music (opera, as I recall). He didn’t want to play well with the other children. He wanted to be left alone. I suppose we could have threatened to take his toys away if he didn’t change. But what would that have accomplished? He wouldn’t be better or happier, and the company would have “lost” its most valuable asset. Changing him wasn’t worth it, which is what I recommended to the CEO. “Your plan is nice in theory. But what you are asking is not connected to what he values,” I said. “Let him be. He’s happy. He’s not going anywhere. Why scare him away by turning him into someone that is just not him?” This fellow was the exception—an aberration.

- Most people’s resistance to change can be overcome by invoking natural law. Everyone, even the biggest ego in the room, has a hot button that can be pushed—and that button is self-interest. All we have to do is find it. It’s not the same thing in all people. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=659))

- Fortunately, successful people make it easy to find the button.

- As a 10-year board member of the Peter Drucker Foundation, I had many opportunities to listen to this great man. Among the myriad wise things I have heard Peter Drucker say, the wisest was, “We spend a lot of time teaching leaders what to do. We don’t spend enough time teaching leaders what to stop. Half the leaders I have met don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.” ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=694))

- Everything in an organization is designed to demonstrate a commitment to positive action—and couched in terms of doing something. We will start paying attention to our customers (rather than stop talking about overselves). We must begin to listen more attentively (rather than stop playing with our BlackBerries while others are talking). Likewise, the recognition and reward systems in most organizations are totally geared to acknowledge the doing of something. We get credit for doing something good. We rarely get credit for ceasing to do something bad. Yet they are flip sides of the same coin. Think of the times you’ve seen colleagues go on a sales call and return with a huge order. If they’re like the salespeople I know, they’ll come back to the office brandishing the lucrative sales order and regaling anyone who’ll listen with a blow-by-blow account of how ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=703))

- they turned the prospect around. They will recount their triumph for months. But turn it around. What if during the sales call these salespeople added up the numbers and realized that they were about to close a deal that actually costs the company money with every unit sold? What if they decided on the spot to stop negotiating and say no to the sale? Do they rush back to the office and boast about the bad deal they’ve just avoided? Hardly—because avoiding mistakes is one of those unseen, unheralded achievements that are not allowed to take up our time and thought. And yet . . . many times avoiding a bad deal can affect the bottom line more significantly than scoring a big sale.

- That’s the funny thing about stopping some behavior. It gets no attention, but it can be as crucial as everything else we do combined. For some reason, we are less likely to poison our thinking this way in normal everyday life. When it comes to stopping behavior or avoiding bad decisions outside the workplace, we congratulate ourselves all the time. A few years ago my wife and I decided not to invest in a real estate venture. Too risky, we thought. Fortunately for us (though not for some of our friends), it went bust.

- Not a month goes by when Lyda and I, sitting around the kitchen table paying our bills, don’t say to each other, “Thank God we didn’t plunk our money into that scheme.” We’re quiet for a moment, think sadly of our friends’ losses, and then resume paying our bills. This is our way of honoring the bad decision we avoided. Likewise with stopping a bad habit in our personal life. If we successfully stop smoking, we regard it as a big achievement—and congratulate ourselves all the time for it. Others do too (as well they should when you consider that the average smoker tries to quit nine times). But we lose this common sense in the can-do environment of an organization—where there is no system for honoring the avoidance of a bad decision or the cessation of bad behavior. Our performance reviews are solely based on what we’ve done, what numbers we’ve delivered, what increases we have posted against last year’s results. Even the seemingly minor personal goals are couched in terms of actions we’ve initiated, not behavior we have stopped. We get credit for being punctual, not for stopping our lateness. We can change this. All that’s required is a slight tweak in our mindset, in how we look at our behavior. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=730))

- Fortunately, there’s a simpler way to achieve the goal of “being nicer.” All you have to do is “stop being a jerk.” It doesn’t require much. You don’t have to think of new ways to be nicer to people. You don’t have to design daily tasks to make over your personality. You don’t have to remember to say nice things and hand out compliments and tell the little white lies that lubricate the gears of the workplace. All you have to do is . . . nothing. When someone offers a less-than-brilliant idea in a meeting, don’t criticize it. Say nothing. When someone challenges one of your decisions, don’t argue with them or make excuses. Quietly consider it and say nothing. When someone makes a helpful suggestion, don’t remind them that you already knew that. Thank them and say nothing. This is not a semantic game. The beauty of knowing what to stop—of achieving this state of inspired neutrality—is that it is so easy to do. Given the choice between becoming a nicer person and ceasing to be a jerk, which do you think is easier to do? The former requires a concerted series of positive acts of commission. The latter is nothing more than an act of omission. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=751))

- 2. Adding too much value: The overwhelming desire to add our two cents to every discussion. 3. Passing judgment: The need to rate others and impose our standards on them. 4. Making destructive comments: The needless sarcasms and cutting remarks that we think make us sound sharp and witty. 5. Starting with “No,” “But,” or “However”: The overuse of these negative qualifiers which secretly say to everyone, “I’m right. You’re wrong.” 6. Telling the world how smart we are: The need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are. 7. Speaking when angry: Using emotional volatility as a management tool. 8. Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work”: The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren’t asked. 9. Withholding information: The refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=783))

- 10. Failing to give proper recognition: The inability to praise and reward. 11. Claiming credit that we don’t deserve: The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success. 12. Making excuses: The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it. 13. Clinging to the past: The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past; a subset of blaming everyone else. 14. Playing favorites: Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly. 15. Refusing to express regret: The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong, or recognize how our actions affect others. 16. Not listening: The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues. 17. Failing to express gratitude: The most basic form of bad manners.

- There’s more good news. These faults are simple to correct. The fix is in the skill set of every human being. For example, the cure for not thanking enough is remembering to say, “Thank you.” (How tough is that?) For not apologizing, it’s learning to say, “I’m sorry. I’ll do better in the future.” For punishing the messenger, it’s imagining how we’d like to be treated under similar circumstances. For not listening, it’s keeping your mouth shut and ears open. And so on. Although this stuff is simple, it’s not easy (there’s a difference). You already know what to do. It’s as basic as tying your shoelaces or riding a bike, or any other skill that lasts a lifetime. We just lose sight of the many daily opportunities to employ them, and thus get rusty.

- Let’s say that you want to go to dinner at restaurant X. Your spouse, partner, or friend wants to go to restaurant Y. You have a heated debate about the choice. You point out the bad reviews Y has received. But you grudgingly yield and end up going to restaurant Y. The experience ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=909))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- confirms your misgivings. Your reservation is lost and you have to wait 30 minutes. The service is slow, the drinks weak, and the food tastes like ripe garbage. You have two options during this painful experience. Option A: Critique the restaurant and smugly point out to your partner how wrong he or she was and how this debacle could have been avoided if only you had been listened to. Option B: Shut up and eat the food. Mentally write it off and enjoy the evening. I have polled my clients on these two options for years. The results are consistent: 75 percent of clients say they would critique the restaurant. What do they all agree that they should do? Shut up and have a good time. If we do a “cost-benefit analysis” we generally conclude that our relationship with our partner is far more important than winning a trivial argument about where to eat. And yet . . . the urge to win trumps our common sense. We do the wrong thing even when we know what we should do.

- That’s how strong the urge to win is. Even with a material witness in the room (i.e., their spouse) who they know will dispute them, many generals still tried to give the answer that made them appear in the most attractive light.

- That’s the problem with adding too much value. Imagine you’re the CEO. I come to you with an idea that you think is very good.

- The problem is, you may have improved the content of my idea by 5 percent, but you’ve reduced my commitment to executing it by 50 percent, because you’ve taken away my ownership of the idea. My idea is now your idea—and I walk out of your office less enthused about it than when I walked in. That’s the fallacy of added value. Whatever we gain in the form of a better idea is lost many times over in our employees’ diminished commitment to the concept. Katzenbach and I had a laugh over this dinner incident later on. As one of the world’s leading authorities on team building, Jon should have known better. But that’s how pernicious the need to win can be. Even when we know better, we fall into its clutches. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that bosses have to zip their lips to keep their staff’s spirits from sagging. But the higher up you go in the organization, the more you need to make other people winners and not make it about winning yourself. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=952))
- People don’t like to be critiqued, however obliquely. That’s why passing judgment is one of the more insidious ways we push people away and hold ourselves back from greater success. The only sure thing that comes out of passing judgment on people’s efforts to help is that they won’t help us again. How do we stop passing judgment, especially when people are honestly trying to help us? One of the awkward situations in my line of work is clients being concerned about whether I approve or disapprove of their behavior—and by extension how I feel about the change they’re trying to make. I try to disabuse them of this thinking immediately. I tell them that in any campaign for effecting long-term positive change, we have a choice. We can view the campaign in an approving light, a disapproving light, or with complete neutrality. Mission Positive. Mission Negative. Or Mission Neutral. I assure them that I am mission neutral. I don’t deal in approval or disapproval. I don’t judge. It’s not my job to weigh in on whether you’re a good person or bad because you’ve decided to change A rather than B. It’s the same as a medical doctor dealing with patients. If you walk into the examining room with a broken leg, the doctor doesn’t pass judgment on how you broke your leg. He doesn’t care if you broke your leg committing a crime or kicking the dog or tripping down the stairs or getting hit by a car. He only cares about fixing your leg. You need to extend that same attitude—the doctor’s mission-neutral purpose—to dealing with people trying to help you. And here I am not referring only to the people who are trying to help you change. You are not allowed to judge any helpful comment offered by a colleague or friend or family member. No matter what you privately think of the suggestion, you must keep your thoughts to yourself, hear the person out, and say, “Thank you.” Try this: For one week treat every idea that comes your way from another person with complete neutrality. Think of yourself as a human Switzerland. Don’t take sides. Don’t express an opinion. Don’t judge the comment. If you find yourself constitutionally incapable of just saying “Thank you,” make it an innocuous, “Thanks, I hadn’t considered that.” Or, “Thanks. You’ve given me something to think about.” After one week, I guarantee you will have significantly reduced the number of pointless arguments you engage in at work or at home. If you continue this for several weeks, at least three good things will happen. First, you won’t have to think about this sort of neutral response; it will become automatic—as easy as saying, “God bless you” when someone sneezes. Second, you will have dramatically reduced the hours you devote to contentious interfacing. When you don’t judge an idea, no one can argue with you. Third, people will gradually begin to see you as a much more agreeable person, even when you are not in fact agreeing with them. Do this consistently and people will eventually brand you as a welcoming… ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1010))

- In other words, we don’t think we make destructive comments, but the people who know us disagree. One of my clients told me that for his fortieth birthday, his colleagues and friends held a “roast” where the evening’s theme required everyone to recite one biting remark that he had made over the years at their expense. An interesting gambit: They were making fun of the birthday boy by revisiting the times he had made fun of them. It was a raucous, hilarious evening. “Here’s the thing,” said my client. “Of the dozens of nasty funny comments I heard that night, I didn’t remember saying one of them. That’s how thoughtless they were. Also, my friends didn’t hate me for it. They may be called ‘destructive’ comments but in my group they didn’t do any destruction. People considered it a part of who I am, and it wasn’t a problem.” He was right; it wasn’t. That’s the other interesting thing about destructive comments. We think it’s common but statistically it’s only a problem in 15 percent of my clients. That doesn’t mean the other 85 percent of the world is not guilty of making destructive comments. We all make them every day. It indicates that only 15 ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1051))

- percent of us do it to the point where it is a problem with our colleagues. What you need to find out is whether that 15 percent includes you. That’s when the real problem begins—because once the comment leaves your lips, the damage is done and it’s very hard to undo. You can’t take it back. No matter how fervently you apologize—and even if the apology is accepted—the comment lingers in the memory. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1060))

- When you start a sentence with “no,” “but,” “however,” or any variation thereof, no matter how friendly your tone or how many cute mollifying phrases you throw in to acknowledge the other person’s feelings, the message to the other person is You are wrong. It’s not, “I have a different opinion.” It’s not, “Perhaps you are misinformed.” It’s not, “I disagree with you.” It’s bluntly and unequivocally, “What you’re saying is wrong, and what I’m saying is right.” Nothing productive can happen after that. The general response from the other person (unless he or she is a saint willing to turn the other cheek) is to dispute your position and fight back. From there, the conversation dissolves into a pointless war. You’re no longer communicating. You’re both trying to win.

But I agree with you and totally understand what you are saying. You mistake me, the ever so wise and lovely me, for someone who needs to hear what you are saying right now. I am not that person. You are confused. You have no idea how smart I am.” Imagine if someone actually said all that to your face. You’d think they were a jackass.

- How do you stop getting angry? I don’t have a definitive answer. Anger management is not the subject of this book, and even if it were, I doubt if I could shut down your rages at life’s injustices and follies. But I can make you appreciate that (a) you’re probably not angry at the proverbial “other guy” and (b) there’s a simple way to lose your reputation for getting angry. On the first point, when I have to deal with anger in my line of work, it’s invariably one-on-one rage—the anger that one human being induces in another. It’s my job to show clients that anger is rarely someone else’s fault. It’s a flaw that’s solely our own. A Buddhist legend tells of a young farmer who was covered with sweat as he paddled his boat up the river. He was going upstream to deliver his produce to the village. He was in a hurry. It was a hot day and he wanted to make his delivery and get home before dark. As he looked ahead, he spied another vessel, heading rapidly downstream toward his boat. This vessel seemed to be making every effort to hit him. He rowed furiously to get out of the way, but it didn’t seem to help.

- He yelled at the other vessel, “Change direction, you idiot! You are going to hit me. The river is wide. Be careful!” His screaming was to no avail. The other vessel hit his boat with a sickening thud. He was enraged as he stood up and cried out to the other vessel, “You moron! How could you manage to hit my boat in the middle of this wide river? What is wrong with you?” As he looked at the other vessel, he realized that there was no one in the other boat. He was screaming at an empty vessel that had broken free of its moorings and was going downstream with the current. The lesson is simple. There is never anyone in the other boat. When we are angry, we are screaming at an empty vessel. All of us have people in our lives who drive us crazy, whom we hate with a passion. We may have spent countless hours reliving the moments when this person was unfair, unappreciative, or inconsiderate to us. Even remembering this person bumps up our blood pressure. It’s obvious that the best course of action for dealing with people like this is to not let them make us angry. Getting angry doesn’t improve the situation and life’s too short to waste on feeling bad. A sage would say that the person making us so angry cannot help who he is. Getting mad at him for being who he is makes as much ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1244))

That’s easier said than done, but it comes closer to the real issue: More often than not, we might as well be him because we are really angry at ourselves. As to the second point, I can help you lose your reputation as a person who gets angry with one simple piece of advice. It is this: If you keep your mouth shut, no one can ever know how you really feel. That’s asking a lot, I know. You have to suppress your natural inclination and bite your tongue.

- We all know negative people—or what my wife calls “negatrons”—in the workplace. They’re the people who are constitutionally incapable of saying something positive or complimentary to any of your suggestions. Negativity is their default response. You could walk into their office with the cure for cancer and the first words out of their mouth would be, “Let me explain why that won’t work.” That, in my experience, is the telltale phrase of negativity. I cite it as a major annoyance because it’s emblematic of our need to share our negative thoughts even when they haven’t been solicited. “Let me explain why that won’t work” is not quite the same as adding too much value—because no value is being added. It’s not like overusing “no,” “but,” and “however,” because we’re not hiding our negativity under the mask of agreement. Nor is it the same as passing judgment on someone else’s ideas—because we’re not rating or comparing anything. We’re not saying it’s good, better, or best. It’s clearly not the same as making destructive comments—because it’s not overtly nasty. “Let me explain why that won’t work” is unique because it is pure unadulterated negativity under the guise of being helpful. We employ it (or its variations such as “The only problem with that is . . .”) to establish that our expertise or authority is superior to someone else’s. It doesn’t mean that what we say is correct or useful. It’s simply a way of inserting ourselves into a situation as chief arbiter or senior critic. The only problem with that (to coin a phrase) is how little we like or respect our critics. They’re annoying. And over time, we treat them as if they’re carrying ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1280))

And it appears in more forms than merely playing our cards close to our vest. You see it in people who exaggerate the virtue of keeping a secret; they use it as an excuse to leave you out of the information flow. You see it in people who answer every question with a question; they believe revealing anything puts them at a disadvantage.

- When I ask them why they fail at recognition, the answers say more about the people responding than the people who aren’t being recognized. “I just got too busy.” “I just expected everyone to do great work.” “I never realized how important it was to them.” “I was never recognized for my great work—why should they be?” Note the aggressive use of the first person singular pronoun. It’s a hallmark of successful people; they become great achievers because of their intense focus on themselves. Their career, their performance, their progress, their needs. But there’s a difference between being an achiever and a leader. Successful people become great leaders when they learn to shift the focus from themselves to others. One of my clients taught me a wonderful technique for improving in the area of providing recognition.   1. He first made a list of all of the important groups of people in his life (friends, family, direct reports, customers, etc.). 2. He then wrote down the names of every important person in each group. 3.

- For one day (or longer if you can handle it) make a mental note of every time you privately congratulate yourself on an achievement, large or small. Then write it down. If you’re like me, you’ll find that you pat yourself on the back more often than you think during a normal day—for everything from coming up with a big idea for a client to showing up on time for a meeting to dashing off a clever note to a colleague. “Hmm,” we think as we survey our beautiful handiwork. “We did good.” There’s nothing wrong with these private thoughts. This pleasure that we take in our own performance is what keeps us merrily motivated as we chug our way through a long, arduous day. I wouldn’t be surprised if one day yielded two dozen episodes of self-congratulation for each of us. Once you’ve assembled the list, take apart each episode and ask yourself if it’s in any way possible that someone else might deserve the credit for “your” achievement. If you showed up on time for a meeting across town, is it because you are heroically punctual and thoughtful? Or was it because your assistant hounded you that morning about the meeting and actually chased you off a phone call and made sure you were out the door to get across town in sufficient time? If you came up with a good idea in a meeting, did it spring unbidden from your fertile imagination? Or was it inspired by an insightful comment from someone else in the room? As you go through your list, consider this make-or-break question: If any of the other people involved in your episodes were looking at the situation, would they accord you as much credit as you are claiming for yourself? Or would they hand it out to someone else, perhaps even themselves? ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=1465))

- I don’t have much patience with “therapy” that clings to the past—because going backwards is not about creating change. It’s about understanding. One of my earliest clients used to spend hours telling me, “Marshall, you don’t understand. Let me explain why I have these issues. Let me explain my mother and father.” It was one long unendurable whine. Finally, I reached into my pocket for a coin and said, “Here’s a quarter. Call someone who cares.” Don’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with understanding. Understanding the past is perfectly admissible if your issue is accepting the past. But if your issue is changing the future, understanding will not take you there.

- approach is looking people in the eye and saying, “If you want to change, do this.” But even with the blunt talk, clients who cling to the past—who want to understand why they are the way they are—remain my toughest assignments. It takes me a long time to convince them that they can’t do anything about the past. They can’t change it, or rewrite it, or make excuses for it. All they can do is accept it and move on. But for some reason, many people enjoy living in the past, especially if going back there lets them blame someone else for anything that’s gone wrong in their lives. That’s when clinging to the past becomes an interpersonal problem. We use the past as a weapon against others. We also cling to the past as a way of contrasting it with the present—usually to highlight something positive about ourselves at the expense of someone else. Do you ever find yourself beginning a long self-serving story with the phrase, “When I was your age . . .”? What’s really going on here? When we make excuses, we are blaming someone or something beyond our control as the reason for our failure. Anyone but ourselves.

I learned this from my daughter, Kelly. She was seven years old. We were living in a nice house in San Diego (still my home). One day, annoyed over a professional setback, I came home and took out my annoyance on Kelly. I trotted out the sorriest, most pathetic speech any parent can give a child, the one that begins, “When I was your age . . .” Inevitably, it’s a self-pitying lecture that points out how difficult and miserable the parent’s childhood was in comparison with the childhood the parent is now providing for his or her children. I started yammering about growing up in Kentucky in a gas station and how we didn’t have money and how hard I had to work to become the first person from my family to graduate from college. Contrasting this, of course, with all the wonderful things Kelly had.

I ask a group of leaders, “How many of you own a dog that you love?” Big smiles cross the executives’ faces as they wave their hands in the air. They beam as they tell me the names of their always-faithful hounds. Then we have a contest. I ask them, “At home, who gets most of your unabashed affection? Is it (a) your husband, wife or partner; (b) your kids; or (c) your dog?” More than 80 percent of the time, the winner is the dog. I then ask the executives if they love their dogs more than their family members. The answer is always a predictable but resounding no. My follow-up: “So why does the dog get most of your attention?” Their replies all sound the same: “The dog is always happy to see me.” “The dog never talks back.” “The dog gives me unconditional love, no matter what I do.” In other words, the dog is a suck-up.

I would like you to give me any ideas about how I can improve.” That statement—an admission of guilt, an apology, and a plea for help—is tough for even the most cold-hearted among us to resist.

- So, you need to ask people to let go of the past. This is simple, but it is not easy. Most of us have never forgiven our mothers and fathers for not being the perfect parents. We cannot forgive our children for not being the ideal kids. We don’t forgive our spouse for not being the perfect partner. Quite often, we can’t forgive ourselves for not being the perfect us.

- It’s not like that with interpersonal behavior, which is vague, subjective, unquantifiable, and open to wildly variant interpretations. But that doesn’t make it less important.

- In my experience the best solicited feedback is confidential feedback. It’s good because nobody gets embarrassed or defensive. There are no emotional issues, because you do not know who to blame or retaliate against for attacking you. In the best cases, you have no sense of being attacked at all. You’re merely ingesting honest commentary—which you requested!—from blind but well-meaning sources. ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=2267))

- Psychologists have all sorts of schemata to explain us to ourselves. One of the more interesting ones is a simple four-pane grid known as the Johari Window (named after two real characters, Joe and Harry).

- As human beings we almost always suffer from the disconnect between the self we think we are and the self that the rest of the world sees in us. The lesson that I learned from Dr. Tannenbaum is that the rest of the world usually has a more accurate perspective than we do. This is the value of unsolicited feedback. And in many ways when I work one-on-one with people, I am re-creating that painful realization inspired by Dr. Tannenbaum. I’m trying to blindside them by making them peer through that fourth window to see what is known to others but unknown to them. If we can stop, listen, and think about what others are seeing in us, we have a great opportunity. We can compare the self that we want to be with the self that we are presenting to the rest of the world. We can then begin to make the real changes that are needed to close the gap between our stated values and our actual behavior.

- You failed to appreciate that every successful project goes through seven phases: The first is assessing the situation; the second is isolating the problem; the third is formulating. But there are three more phases before you get to the seventh, implementation. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t pay close attention to phases four, five, and six—the vital period when you approach your coworkers to secure the all-important political buy-in to your plans. In each phase you must target a different constituency. In phase 4, you woo up—to get your superiors to approve. In phase 5, you woo laterally—to get your peers to agree. In phase 6, you woo down—to get your direct reports to accept. These three phases are the sine qua non of getting things done. You cannot skip or skim over them. You have to give them as much, if not more, attention, as you do phases one, two, three, and seven. If you don’t, you may as well be working alone in a locked room where no one sees you, hears you, or knows you exist.

- Not true. Good listeners regard what they do as a highly active process—with every muscle engaged, especially the brain. Basically, there are three things that all good listeners do: They think before they speak; they listen with respect; and they’re always gauging their response by asking themselves, “Is it worth it?” Let’s examine each one and see if it makes us better listeners.

- Frances Hesselbein does a lot of things well. But she does one thing superbly above all else. She thinks before she speaks. As a result she is a world-class listener. If you asked her if this was a passive gesture, she would assure you that it requires great discipline, particularly when she is upset about what she’s hearing. After all, what do most of us do when we’re angry? We speak (and not in the carefully measured tones of a diplomat). What do we do when we’re upset? We talk. What do we do when we’re confused or surprised or shocked? Again, we talk. This is so predictable that we can see the other party almost cringe in anticipation of our harsh unthinking autoreflex response. Not so with Frances Hesselbein. You could tell her the world was about to end and she would think before opening her mouth, not only about what she would say but how she would phrase it. Whereas most people think of listening as something we do during those moments when we are not talking, Frances Hesselbine knows that listening is a two-part maneuver. There’s the part where we actually listen. And there’s the part where we speak. Speaking establishes how we are perceived as a listener.

- The trouble with listening for many of us is that while we’re supposedly doing it, we’re actually busy composing what we’re going to say next. This is a negative two-fer: You’re not only failing to hear the other person, you’re orchestrating a comment that may annoy them, either because it misses the point, adds meaningless value to the discussion, or worst of all, injects a destructive tone into the mix. Not the desired result of listening. Keep it up and soon you won’t have to worry about listening—because no one will be talking to you anymore. When someone tells us something, we have a menu of options to fashion our response. Some of our responses are smart, some are stupid. Some are on point, some miss the point. Some will encourage the other person, some will discourage her. Some will make her feel appreciated, some will not.

- chess; it’s also the lowest grade of listening. Asking, “Is it worth it?” engages you in thinking beyond the discussion to consider (a) how the other person regards you, (b) what that person will do afterwards, and (c) how that person will behave the next time you talk. That’s a lot of consequences emanating out of “Is it worth it?” Think about the last time you floated an idea in a meeting and the most senior person in the room (assuming it wasn’t you) ripped you for saying it. It doesn’t matter whether your idea was dumb and the other person’s response was brilliant—or vice versa. Just think about how you felt. Did you think more highly of the other person saying it? Did it make you appreciate anew that person’s tremendous listening skills? Did it inspire you to go back to your work with fresh enthusiasm? Did it make you more eager to speak up the next time you were in a meeting with that person? I’d wager the answers are no, no, no, and no. That’s what happens when you respond without asking “Is it worth it?” People not only think you don’t listen, but you have instigated a three-part chain of consequences: (1) they are hurt; (2) they harbor ill feelings toward the person who inflicted the hurt (i.e., they hate you); and (3) in the predictable response to negative reinforcement, they are less likely to repeat the event (i.e., they won’t speak up next time). Keep it up, and here’s what will happen: Everyone will think you’re an ass (a personal judgment, not necessarily damaging, but certainly not nice). They won’t perform well for you (which damages your reputation as a leader). And they’ll stop giving you ideas (which reduces your knowledge base). This is hardly the formula for leadership success. One of my clients was the chief operating officer of a multi-billion dollar company (and now the CEO). His goal was to become a better listener and be perceived as a more open-minded boss. After working with him for 18 months, I asked him what was the major learning kernel he got out of the experience.

As a result, his scores for being a better listener and an open-minded boss skyrocketed. And he became the CEO. The implications of “Is it worth it?” are profound—and go beyond listening. In effect, you are taking the age-old question of self-interest, “What’s in it for me?” one step further to ask, “What’s in it for him?” That’s a profound consequential leap of thought. Suddenly, you’re seeing the bigger picture. As I say over and over again, this is simple stuff—but it’s not easy. If you do it, everything will get better.

Incredibly, more than half my clients can’t do it. Somewhere around twenty or thirty, nagging thoughts invade their brain. They think about a problem at work, or their kids, or how much they ate for dinner the night before. This may sound like a concentration test, but it’s really a listening exercise. After all, if you can’t listen to yourself (someone you presumably like and respect) as you count to fifty, how will you ever be able to listen to another person? Like any exercise, this drill both exposes a weakness and helps you get stronger. If I ask you to touch your toes and you can’t, we’ve revealed that your muscles are tight. If you practice touching your toes each day, eventually you’ll become more limber. That’s what this fifty-count exercise achieves. It exposes how easily distracted we can be when we’re not talking. But it also helps us develop our concentration muscles—our ability to maintain focus. Do this exercise regularly and you’ll soon be counting to 50 without interrupting yourself. This newfound power of concentration will make you a better listener. ([Location 2906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=2906))

- Let me make an important admission: I didn’t start out knowing this about the importance of follow-up. I was preparing training sessions at a Fortune 100 company when the Executive Vice President, perhaps with an eye on the training budget, asked me the perfectly reasonable question, “Does anyone who goes to these leadership development programs ever really change?” I thought about it for a moment, and thought some more, then sheepishly answered, “I don’t know.” I had trained thousands of people. I had received glowing reviews about my classes (although it occurred to me that the reviews only meant attendees thought my classes were valuable; it didn’t prove their value). I had dozens of letters from people who believed they had changed (although I realized that didn’t mean anyone else believed they had changed).

- asked me that question. Worse, until that moment, it had never entered my mind. This was a life-altering moment for me. Until then I had been one of the more successful practitioners of 360-degree feedback, a participative management concept that had workers evaluating their managers rather than the other way around. My personal contribution to the field was the notion of “custom feedback.” I created surveys that answered the question, “What makes a great leader in this particular organization?” But even though I loved to crunch numbers, I had never gone back to these companies to see if my training sessions had had any effect or if people actually did what they promised to do in the training sessions. I assumed that if they understood the benefit of listening to wise, wonderful, and practical me, they would do what they were told. Chastened by the executive vice president’s piercingly obvious question, I became a follow-up grind for the next two years. I scoured all the research and went back to all my client corporations, assembling data that answered the question, “Does anyone really change?” The numbers slowly grew into a statistically significant pile that involved eight major corporations, each of which invested millions of dollars a year in leadership development programs. In other words, they took the ([Location 3049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3049))

- process of developing executives very seriously. My pool of respondents eventually numbered 86,000 participants.* As I studied the data, three conclusions emerged. The first lesson: Not everyone responds to executive development, at least not in the way the organization desires or intends. Some people are trainable; some aren’t. It’s not because they don’t want to get better. At the eight companies where hundreds of employees have gone through my leadership development training, I asked the participants at the end of each session whether they intended to go back to their job and apply what they had just learned. Almost 100 percent said yes. A year later I asked the direct reports of these same leaders to confirm that their boss applied the lessons on the job. About 70 percent said yes and 30 percent said the boss had done absolutely nothing. This 70/30 split showed up with statistically elegant consistency in each of the eight companies I studied, and it didn’t waver whether the executives involved were Americans, Europeans, or Asians. In other words, it reflects human nature, not cultural imprinting. When I drilled a little deeper to find out why executives would go through training, promise to implement what they learned, and then not do it, the answer was incredibly mundane and, again, reflective of human nature. They failed to implement the changes because they were simply too busy. After the training session, they all returned to their offices to find piles of messages to return, reports to read and write, clients and customers to call. They were distracted by the day-to-day demands of their job. This taught me a second lesson: There is an enormous disconnect between understanding and doing. Most leadership development revolves around one huge false assumption: If people understand, then they will do. That’s not true. Most of us understand, we just don’t do. For example, we all understand that being grossly overweight is bad for our health, but not all of us actually do anything to change our condition. But this insight didn’t really answer my question. It only indicated that 70… ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3059))

I traced five of my eight companies to measure the level of follow-up among their executives. Follow-up was defined as interaction between would-be “leaders” and their colleagues to see if they were, in fact, improving their leadership effectiveness. Follow-up ran through five scales—from “frequent interaction” to “little or none.” The results were astonishingly consistent. At one end of the spectrum, when leaders did little or no follow-up with their subordinates, there was little or no perceived change in the leaders’ effectiveness. At the other extreme, when leaders consistently… ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3080))

Historically, much of executive development has focused on the importance of an event—whether it’s in the form of a training program, a motivational speech, or an intense executive retreat. My experience with the eight companies proves that real leadership development involves a process that takes time. It doesn’t happen in a day. Nor can you “get it” in the form of a nitroglycerin tablet. ([Location 3101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3101))

- Feedforward asks you to do four simple steps:   1. Pick the one behavior that you would like to change which would make a significant, positive difference in your life. For example, I want to be a better listener. 2. Describe this objective in a one-on-one dialogue with anyone you know. It could be your wife, kids, boss, best friend, or coworker. It could even be a stranger. The person you choose is irrelevant. He or she doesn’t have to be an expert on the subject. For example, you say, I want to be a ([Location 3194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3194))

- better listener. Almost anyone in an organization knows what this means. You don’t have to be an “expert” on listening to know what good listening means to you. Likewise, he or she doesn’t have to be an expert on you. If you’ve ever found yourself on a long flight seated next to a perfect stranger and proceeded to engage in an earnest, heartfelt, and honest discussion of your problems with that stranger—or vice versa—you know this is true. Some of the truest advice can come from strangers. We are all human beings. We know what is true. And when a useful idea comes along, we don’t care who the source is. (If you think about it, a stranger—someone who has no past with you and who cannot possibly hold your past failings against you or, for that matter, even bring them up—may be your ideal feedforward “partner.”) 3. Ask that person for two suggestions for the future that might help you achieve a positive change in your selected behavior—in this case, becoming a better listener. If you’re talking to someone who knows you or who has worked with you in the past, the only ground rule is that ([Location 3200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3200))

- there can be no mention of the past. Everything is about the future. For example, you say, I want to be a better listener. Would you suggest two ideas that I can implement in the future that will help me become a better listener? The other person suggests, First, focus all your attention on the other person. Get in a physical position, the “listening position,” such as sitting on the edge of your seat or leaning forward toward the individual. Second, don’t interrupt, no matter how much you disagree with what you’re hearing. These two ideas represent feedforward. 4. Listen attentively to the suggestions. Take notes if you like. Your only ground rule: You are not allowed to judge, rate, or critique the suggestions in any way. You can’t even say something positive, such as, “That’s a good idea.” The only response you’re permitted is, Thank you.

- It works because we can change the future but not the past. It doesn’t deal in wishes, dreams, and conquering the impossible. It works because helping people be “right” is more productive than proving them “wrong.” Unlike feedback, which often introduces a discussion of mistakes and shortfalls, feedforward focuses on solutions, not problems. On the most elemental level, it works because people do not take feedforward as personally as feedback. ([Location 3263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3263))

- Instead of rehashing a past that cannot be changed, feedforward encourages you to spend time creating a future by (a) asking for suggestions for the future, (b) listening to ideas, and (c) just saying thank you. Its strongest element, by far, is that it doesn’t permit you to bring up the past—ever. It forces you to let go of the past.

- A lot of bosses are already doing some variation on this with their employees. I know one self-made man who has a volcanic temper. He doesn’t fly off the handle too often. But he leads a very busy schedule, starting at 4 A.M. with dictation to his secretary, phone calls to distant time zones, and not one but two breakfast meetings. By the time the rest of us begin our workday, he’s already worked a full day—and begun another one. As a result, he’s chronically tired, which means he’s chronically testy. The slightest annoyance can set him off. The good news is that he knows this about himself. He’s not putting on a show—like a baseball manager throwing a fake hissy fit over an umpire’s bad call. He’s genuinely mad. But the rage dies down as quickly as it erupted. To him, the tantrum acts as a release valve. I’ve seen him when he’s lost it, and it’s not a pretty picture.

- have been to known to burst into tears during one of his tirades. To his credit, he regains his composure instantly and always tells his staff, “I’m not mad at you. I’m just mad. And now it’s over and forgotten. I’m sorry you had to be here to witness it.” A little bit of this is phony (he probably is angry at something a staffer has done) but he’s smart enough to let them know that he’s behaving like a jerk and they ought to ignore it. This sort of candor is admirable—because it features a boss trying to get better by admitting to a managerial shortcoming, telling his colleagues, and helping them deal with it. (If I were his coach, I’d also have him soliciting suggestions—i.e., feedforward—from his staff on how he could correct this shortcoming, but let’s take it one step at a time.)

- It took a while for this free agent virus to spread. But trust me, it’s an epidemic now, a sweeping pathology that demands a change in the way bosses think. The first thing I do with managers who are overwhelmed or confused by this workplace shift is make them see that they are prejudiced about their employees. This always gets their attention. “Me. Prejudiced? Get outta here!” But if prejudice means harboring inflexible, intolerant beliefs about a group of people that do not coincide with reality or how that group sees itself, it’s true. Managers who are blind to the changes in this new cohort of free agents are operating like dangerous, deluded executive bigots. (It’s no different than a manager refusing to hire a young married woman because he believes she will leave her job eventually to have babies and, therefore, is not serious about her career. It’s easy to forget that there was a time not too long ago when almost everyone thought this way.) The prejudice against free agents takes many forms, but here are four that any of us can easily fall into. ([Location 3947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=3947))

- In the same way that some of your problems do not need fixing because they are an issue to only a small minority of people, as a boss you should stop trying to change people who don’t want to change. This may sound harsh, but some people are unsalvageable. You’re only banging your head against a wall if you think you can fix them. Believe me, I know. It’s taken me years to appreciate that some problems are so deep and systemic and strange that they are impervious to my particular ministrations. Through trial and error, I have shed all illusions about my methods, and concluded that some flaws can’t be coached away by any boss, especially with the following employees. Stop trying to change people who don’t think they have a problem. Have you ever attempted to change the behavior of a successful adult at work who has no interest in changing? How much luck have you had with this conversion activity? The answer is always the same: No luck. Now bring it closer to home. Have you had any luck trying to change a spouse, partner, or significant other who has no interest in changing? Again, same answer.

- how she behaved in the classroom and in the real world. She talked to everyone with the same slow patient cadence and simple vocabulary that she employed with her six-year-olds each day. Mom lived in a world entirely populated by first graders. I was always in the first grade. Her siblings were always in the first grade. All of our relatives were in the first grade. My father was in the first grade. Mom was always correcting everyone’s grammar. One day she was correcting my father (for the ten thousandth time). He looked at her, sighed, and said, “Honey, I’m 70 years old. Let it go.” If your people don’t care about changing, don’t waste your time. Stop trying to change people who are pursuing the wrong strategy for the organization. If they’re going in the wrong direction, all you’ll do is help them get there faster. Stop trying to change people who should not be in their job. Some people feel they’re in the wrong job at the wrong company. Perhaps they believe that they were meant to be doing something else. Or that their skills are being misused. Or that they they’re missing something. If you have any sensitivity, you have a good idea who these people are. Even if you pick up only a tiny molecule of this vibe, ask them, “What if we shut down today? ([Location 4068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J128&location=4068))

I could make more money working with other people, but I don’t want to leave the people here.” 3. “I can follow my dreams. This organization is giving me a chance to do what I really want to do in life.”   The answers were never about money. They were always about happiness, relationships, following dreams, and meaning.
