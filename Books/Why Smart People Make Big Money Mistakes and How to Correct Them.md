## Highlights
- Behavioral economics, which brings together tools and insights from economics and psychology, truly can explain why and how people make seemingly irrational or illogical decisions when they spend, invest, save, and borrow money.

- Whatever the prevailing theory, economic study has traditionally been informed by a few core assumptions. The most significant are that humans are fundamentally rational and ultimately ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=114))

- efficient when it comes to money. Put simply: We know what we want, what we want is for our own good, and we know (or will figure out) the best way to get it. In short, people make rational, consistent, and self-interested decisions. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=115))

- Most economic theories assume that people can find value in things that do not necessarily enhance their material well-being. They concede that humans can be motivated by non-financial concerns like love or generosity or convenience. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=122))

- As you might imagine, such a dogged insistence on rationality, self-interest, and consistency as the driving forces behind financial decisions has often put economists in a quandary: How to explain seemingly irrational human behavior as the result of the rational pursuit of self-interest? Consider, as just one example, our habit of tipping. If you think about it, tipping is about as irrational as can be: folks routinely giving away money without a clear obligation to do so, to people they’ll likely never see again, in places they’ll never revisit, for a level of service that may not have even pleased them. Marketing professor Michael Lynn, after reviewing a great many studies of tipping published over the years, found that exceptional service increased the average tip by less than 2 percent, which means that a lot of non-exceptional service is consistently being rewarded.

- Not surprising, right? Everybody tips because, well, we just do. For economists, though, explaining why that is has always been tough. It’s not enough ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=136))

- to say that the self-interest in tipping is the guarantee of good service. Tipping comes after the meal, so that would only explain why people might tip in neighborhood restaurants or other eateries to which they are certain they will return. It does not explain why, as several studies have shown, travelers will tip their waiter at, say, a California Pizza Kitchen in Chicago when they know it’s unlikely they’ll ever eat there again. Where’s the self-interest in that? Nor is it sufficient to explain tipping as simply the result of goodwill—a heartwarming decision by the vast majority of Americans (people don’t generally… ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=137))

- attendants, cashiers, and bank tellers. So why do Americans tip? No one knows for certain, but the economist Russell Roberts, author of The Price of Everything and other novels about economics, has some interesting thoughts on the matter. He notes that people frequently use social heuristics—rules of thumb—when interacting with each other, without conscious acknowledgment, as a way to make life a more pleasant experience. For example, most of us agree to wait our turn in line at the car wash rather than bang fenders with one another to get there first. Roberts theorizes that Americans have… ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=143))

- by a grouch was the goal, we could just stay home.) And because diners are better judges of service than restaurant managers could ever be, a social rule of thumb evolved over time: Servers should be paid low wages that are supplemented by tips. Problem solved: Restaurant managers leave the difficult job of policing their staff to patrons—allegedly, the word tip has its origins in eighteenth-century England, where coffeehouse patrons were asked to put coins in a box labeled “To Insure Promptness.” The problem today, of course, is that people often tip without thinking. According to one survey, only 54 percent of respondents said they based their tip on the quality of service; 30 percent tip out of pity; and roughly 10 percent say they tip because it’s expected. So… ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=148))

- Similarly, economic theory was essentially at a loss—even if economists wouldn’t admit it—to explain why people stampede to invest in the stock of companies (or to get rid of their shares) for no better reason than that other investors are doing the same.

- More specifically, Tversky and Kahneman’s experiments were important to the field of economics because they made it clear that people’s judgments and decisions are not always fully rational. While this may seem as earth-shattering as proving that the sun rises in the morning, the act of scientifically validating common sense was in this case quite significant, for several reasons. Not the least was that Kahneman and Tversky (and many others who followed) were able to start describing and classifying many of the tricks that people use to simplify and solve some of the difficult problems of judgment and choice that confront them. Kahneman and Tversky referred to these simplifying procedures as ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=207))

- “judgmental heuristics”—mental shortcuts (or rules of thumb) that most people rely on reflexively. Such guidelines might be instinctive (a long line at a restaurant probably means business is good) or societally reinforced (it’s a good idea to stretch your budget when buying a house), but in either case, they are sometimes misleading. Long lines at a restaurant can mean that the service is slow or that other competing restaurants are closed; home prices don’t rise as fast or as much as Americans think, and even when they do, such levels are rarely sustainable (as we have seen in recent years). So there is often no financial justification for buying more house than you can afford in the hope that price hikes will reward you later. We should point out that heuristics, ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=211))

- judgmental and otherwise, have been essential to human evolution (regardless of whether you think we evolved over six thousand or six million years). In order to get through life, humans have to make thousands of decisions every day. Some of these decisions are decidedly conscious (say, where to go in the morning) and some are completely mindless (say, which muscles do you twitch to take your next step). But whatever their nature, that’s a whole lot of choices to make and still get stuff done during the day. And so human brains come with decision-making shortcuts—heuristics—that make deciding easier.

- behavioral economics can be fairly described as the study of obsolete heuristics; the study of rules of thumb that were useful to our ancestors on the savannah or in the jungles but often get in our way today. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=225))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Despite these inroads, however, there’s one realm where behavioral economics has yet to achieve the prominence it deserves: the minds of typical consumers, savers, borrowers, spenders, and investors. That’s who this book is for. We’ve distilled four decades of academic research—the labors of Kahneman, Tversky, and dozens of others, including one of this book’s authors—into an easy-to-navigate guide to the workings of our money mind-sets.

- Our focus in this book is on patterns of thought and behavior that lead most people—people in general—to get less out of their financial choices than they should. That focus is not always easy to maintain, in part because some concepts of behavioral economics can appear to contradict each other at times. This is not surprising, given the way the human mind works. But we don’t want readers of one chapter to throw up their hands in dismay when the next chapter seems to be saying something quite opposite. An example? In Chapter 7, we’ll talk about herding, which is ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=276))

- the tendency many people have to rely too much on the opinions or actions of others, as when investors buy or sell a stock simply because the company is recommended or dismissed by a stockbroker or because everyone else is buying or selling it. On the flip side, Chapter 6 focuses on people’s tendency toward overconfidence, which causes them to have more faith than they should in the reliability of their own judgment or experience. How can we reconcile these two concepts? We can’t. Sometimes people make mistakes because they behave like sheep, and sometimes they err because they behave like mules. The critical task is to identify which tendency is harming us in what circumstance and then try to break the habit. People are overconfident in predictable ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=280))

- By the third day of their honeymoon in Las Vegas, the newlyweds had lost their $1,000 gambling allowance. That night in bed, the groom noticed a glowing object on the dresser. Upon inspection, he realized it was a $5 chip they had saved as a souvenir. Strangely, the number 17 was flashing on the chip’s face. Taking this as an omen, he donned his green bathrobe and rushed down to the roulette ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=303))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- tables, where he placed the $5 chip on the square marked 17. Sure enough, the ball hit 17 and the 35–1 bet paid $175. He let his winnings ride, and once again the little ball landed on 17, paying $6,125. And so it went, until the lucky groom was about to wager $7.5 million. Unfortunately the floor manager intervened, claiming that the casino didn’t have the money to pay should 17 hit again. Undaunted, the groom taxied to a better-financed casino downtown. Once again he bet it all on 17—and once again it hit, paying more than $262 million. Ecstatic, he let his millions ride—only to lose it all when the ball fell on 18. Broke and dejected, the groom walked the several miles back to his hotel. “Where were you?” asked his bride ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=305))

- This story has the distinction of being the only roulette joke we know that deals with a bedrock principle of behavioral economics. Indeed, depending on whether or not you agree with our groom’s account of his evening’s adventure, you might have an idea why we considered a different title for this chapter: “Why Casinos Always Make Money.” The usual answer to that question—casinos are consistently profitable because the odds are always stacked in management’s favor—does not tell the whole story. Another reason casinos always make money is that too many people think like our newlywed: Because he started his evening with just $5, he felt his loss was limited to that amount. This view holds that his gambling winnings were somehow not real money—or not his money, anyway—and so his losses were not real losses. No matter that had the groom left the casino after his penultimate bet, he could have walked across the street and bought a brand-new BMW for every behavioral economist in the country (and had enough left over to remain a multimillionaire). The happy salesman at the twenty-four-hour dealership would never have asked if the $262 million belonged to the groom. Of course it did. But the groom, like most amateur gamblers, viewed his winnings as a different kind of money, and he was therefore more willing to make extravagant bets with it. In casino-speak this is called playing with “house money.” The tendency of most gamblers to fall prey to this illusion is why casinos would make out like bandits even if the odds weren’t stacked so heavily in their favor. The “Legend of the Man in the Green Bathrobe,” as the above tale is known, illustrates a concept that… ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=313))

- The notion of mental accounts is absent in traditional economic theory, which holds that wealth in general, and money in particular, should be fungible: That is, $100 in roulette winnings, $100 in salary, and a $100 tax refund should have the same significance and value to you, since each C-note could buy the same number of downloads from iTunes or the same number of burgers at McDonald’s. Likewise, $100 kept under the mattress should invoke the ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=341))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- same feelings or sense of wealth as $100 in a bank account or $100 in U.S. Treasury securities (ignoring the fact that money in the bank, or in T-bills, is safer than cash under the bed). If money and wealth are fungible, there should be no difference in the way we spend gambling winnings or salary. Every financial decision should result from a rational calculation of its effect on our overall wealth. If only this were the case. People are not machines. They lack the computational power and the strength of will needed to manage their finances on a consolidated balance sheet. It would be intellectually difficult, and emotionally taxing, to calculate the cost of every short-term transaction (buying a new song, for instance, or going to a movie) ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=344))

- against the size of every long-term goal or need (planning for retirement or saving for college). So to cope with this daunting organizational task, people separate their money into mental accounts, necessarily treating a dollar in one account differently from a dollar in another, since each account has a different significance. A vacation allowance, for instance, is presumably treated with less gravitas than the same amount of money socked away in an Individual Retirement Account. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=349))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Yes, the often useful habit of treating one dollar differently from another has a dark side, too, with consequences far more significant than increasing your willingness to make crazy bets at roulette tables. By assigning relative values to different moneys that in reality have the same buying power, you run the risk of being too quick to spend, too slow to save, or too conservative when you invest—all of which can cost you. Just think about the way people value earned income as opposed to gift income. That is, we’ll spend $50 from Mom (or $50 we find in the street) with less thought than $50 we’ve earned on the job. In fact, studies suggest that we’ll spend $50 we’re given as a bonus at work more easily than $50 we’ve been told was owed to us in salary but mistakenly withheld. Think about that: same money ($50), same source (an employer), but you’re more likely to spend one check than the other. Don’t quite believe it? Consider an experiment conducted by Nick Epley, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, along with Harvard’s Dennis Mak and Lorraine Chen Idson. Two dozen Harvard students were told they were receiving a $25 windfall as part of a research project and could spend as much of it as they wanted at a “lab store,” which carried stuff students are used to seeing at campus bookstores or co-ops: school mugs, snack foods, pens, etc. Any unspent money, the students were told, would be sent to them by check. All the students had been told that the research lab was partially funded by tuition dollars, but—and here’s the interesting part—for half the participants the $25 was described as a “rebate” and for the other half it was described as a “bonus.” That small difference, though, was all that was necessary to dramatically affect how the students handled their windfall: 84 percent of those whose $25 was framed as a “bonus” spent some or all of it, but only 21 percent of students who had their $25 described as a “rebate” opened their wallets. Mental accounting is a powerful driver of our actions even if the accounts aren’t meaningfully different—all the students, after all, were told that the lab was partially funded by tuition dollars. The framing of the $25 should have been immaterial, but it wasn’t, by a long shot. This has obvious implications for economic policy. Twice in recent years, the government has tried to stimulate economic activity by giving people tax rebates. There is considerable evidence that the programs did not work as well as intended on either occasion, and calling the checks “rebates” may have been part of the problem. As Epley describes ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=363))

- The principles of mental accounting are governed not only by the size of a purchase or investment, but also by the size of a payment received, be it a bonus, rebate, refund, or gift. So a payment that might otherwise be placed in a “splurge-on-myself” mental account—a bonus from work, say, or a tax refund—will be deposited in a more serious, long-term account if it is big enough (and vice versa). That’s curious, when you think about it. If you get a small refund or bonus—say, $250—chances are you’re far more likely to buy a $250 pair of shoes with it than if you get a $2,500 bonus or refund, even though you can presumably afford it more in the second ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=418))

- instance. Somehow, a bigger chunk of found money makes it more sacred and serious and harder to spend, actually lowering your “spending rate,” or what economists call your “marginal propensity to consume.” It’s a clunky term, but understanding this concept will help you see why it may be tough for you to hold on to money and why a bonus or a gift may actually do you more harm than good. Your spending rate is simply the percentage of an incremental dollar that you spend rather than save. So if you receive a $100 tax refund and spend $80, your spending rate is .80 (or 80 percent). You might think, then, that the highest spending rate you can have is 1—that is, for every incremental dollar you receive, the most you could spend is a dollar. If only wishing made it so. Let us explain. About thirty years ago, an economist at the Bank of Israel named Michael Landsberger undertook a study of a group of Israelis who were receiving regular restitution payments from the West German government after World War II. Although these payments could fairly be described as blood money—inasmuch as they were intended to make up for Nazi atrocities—they could also be described as found money. Because of this, and because the payments varied significantly in size from one individual or family to another, Landsberger could gauge the effect of the size of these windfalls on each recipient’s spending rate. What he discovered was amazing. People who received the larger payments (equal to roughly two-thirds ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=423))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- of their annual income) had a spending rate of about 0.23. In other words, for every dollar they received, their marginal spending increased by 23 percent; the rest was saved. Conversely, the group that received the smallest windfall payments (equal to 7 percent of annual income) had a spending rate of 2. That’s correct: For every dollar of found money, they spent two. Or, more accurately, for every dollar of found money, they spent $1 of found money and another $1 from “savings” (what they actually saved or what they might have saved).

- You may be prone to mental accounting if… • you don’t think you’re a reckless spender, but you have trouble saving. • you have savings in the bank and revolving balances on your credit cards. • you’re more likely to splurge with a tax refund than with savings. • you seem to spend more when you use credit cards than when you use cash. • most of your retirement savings are in fixed-income or other conservative investments ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=525))

- So in order to begin to eliminate the harmful elements of mental accounting, while preserving its benefits, you have to audit your own internal accounting system. We’ll give you two ways to begin this process, one that’s fun and one that’s a bit more serious. First the fun stuff, in the form of another set of scenarios. Imagine that you’re at the racetrack for a day of gambling or at your favorite store shopping for a suit. Yesterday you won $1,000 from your state’s instant lottery game. Will you bet more ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=538))

- tonight than you would otherwise, or will you buy a more expensive suit? Now imagine that you’re once again at the racetrack for a day of gambling or at your favorite store shopping for a suit. Yesterday you realized that you had $1,000 in a savings account that you had forgotten about. Will you bet more tonight than you would otherwise, or will you buy a more expensive suit? If you would bet more in the first instance and buy a pricier suit in the second—as most people would—you’re prone to mental accounting, which means you’re prone to wasting money because you wrongly put different values on the same dollars. No doubt ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=541))

- skeptics will say that it is perfectly logical to be more reckless with lottery winnings than rediscovered savings, so what is Belsky and Gilovich’s problem? Our problem is that while it may not make a difference if you blow a Powerball payoff, this habit can cost you in ways you might not consider. Our second test should help doubters see the light. All you need to do is review your finances and answer two questions: (1) Do you have emergency or other nonretirement savings?; and (2) Do you carry balances on your credit cards from month to month? If the answer is yes to both, you’re a victim of mental accounting. Why? Because you’ve placed too high a value on your savings dollars and too low a value on your borrowed dollars. As a result, you’re at best earning 2 to 4 percent a year on your emergency savings while paying 15 percent a year in credit-card interest. For every $1,000 on your credit card, that’s a yearly loss of roughly $110 to $130. If you do nothing else after reading this but pay off $1,000 in credit-card balances with short-term savings, then you’ve earned the price of this book about ten times over. And for those who say that emergency money should be left just for emergencies, our response is that if you pay off your credit-card balances with short-term savings, you could always fill up those same credit cards in the event that you or your spouse is laid off or laid up. Believe us when we tell you that your credit-card company won’t cut or eliminate your access to their high-rate loans if you pay off your balances. More than likely they’ll raise your credit limit, so that you’ll be that much more prepared for emergencies. And all the while you’ll be saving the difference between the money you would have been paying in interest and the money you would have earned from a money market account.

- as found money that can be spent relatively carelessly, our advice is to train yourself to wait awhile before making any spending decisions. In other words, tell yourself that you can do whatever you want with that cash, but in three or six months. In the meantime, park it in a bank or money market account. Make that the rule. At the least you’ll have a few extra dollars for your trouble. More than likely, by the time your deadline rolls around, you’ll view this money as savings—hard earned and not to be wasted.

After ensuring that no other obvious force (say, income or political affiliation) had been influencing voters, the researchers found that people were noticeably more likely (63.6 percent vs. 56.3 percent) to say yes to a school tax increase if their polling location were located…in a school! Simply being in a school when voting, which presumably reminded some voters of education’s importance, was enough to frame the choice in a different light for a big chunk of them.

- Think about this in nautical terms: Your investments are the flotilla you hope will carry you to the shores of a secure retirement over the choppy seas of life. But rather than sticking with boats that have proven their seaworthiness, you routinely abandon ship in favor of dinghies that already have leaks. This may strike you as logical, particularly if you’re a person who sells winners more often than losers. The argument for such reasoning would be that the winners have already had their run, while losing stocks have yet to make their move. It’s a version of regression theory, discussed in the introduction to this book: The seaworthy boats (which had their tailwind of good fortune) are due to spring some leaks, while it’s about time the leaky boats become more secure; better to sell the good boats now before they sink.

- Loss aversion is especially tricky and harmful because we may feel the pain of a loss that’s not really a loss. Exhibit A: the trouble some people have trying to save. Many of us experience the lessening of current buying power (which saving for the future entails) as a loss. No matter that the money we save is ours to spend later; a sense of loss, and our aversion to it, makes it tough to sock money away.

- to overcome that problem, at least at the workplace. It’s called SMarT (Save More Tomorrow) and here’s how it works: Rather than expecting employees to pull money from their paychecks and direct it toward retirement accounts—which seems impractical or just plain unpleasant for many workers trying to make ends meet—SMarT asks workers to commit a portion of future raises to retirement savings, thus eliminating the feeling of loss from current spending. Sounds simple, but when put into practice, SMarT has had dramatic results, in some cases helping employees more than quadruple their savings rate, from around 3 percent to nearly 14 percent. SMarT indeed. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=776))

- GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD Imagine that you’ve been given courtside tickets to a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game or a classical music performance. You’re dying to go because you’ve always wanted to see LeBron James or Yo-Yo Ma. Before you leave your house, you learn that James is injured and won’t play, or that Ma won’t perform. Plus, a sudden snowstorm makes the trip to the game or ballet unpleasant and somewhat dangerous. Do you go? Now imagine the same game or concert, except in this instance you paid a small fortune for the ticket yourself and there’s no chance of selling it to someone else. Do you go? A particular form of loss aversion to which we are all prone is what Richard Thaler described in 1980 as the “sunk cost fallacy.” This psychological trap is the primary reason most people would choose to risk traveling in a dangerous snowstorm if they had paid for a ticket to an important game or concert, while passing on the trip if they had been given the ticket for free. The distinction makes no sense, of course: The money for the ticket is spent—or sunk—in either case; you won’t get it back whether you go to the event or watch it on television. As a matter of fact, going to the game or concert means incurring an extra cost: the chance you might die or be seriously injured. Therefore the danger posed by the snowstorm should carry equal significance for people who receive the ticket for free or pay for it. That it doesn’t—that there is more significance because we have sunk money into the deal, regardless of whether or not that money can be retrieved—is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. And this isn’t just hypothetical theorizing. For a seminal 1985 research paper entitled “The Psychology of Sunk Cost,” published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, psychologists Hal R. Arkes and Catherine Blumer conducted an interesting real-life experiment. They randomly distributed discounts to buyers of subscriptions to Ohio University Theater’s 1982–1983 season. One group of buyers paid the normal ticket price of $15; a second group received a $2 discount per ticket; and a third received $7 off each ticket. Members of the last two groups were told that the discount was being given as part of a promotion by the theater department. The result? People who paid more for their tickets attended the performances more often than those who had received discounts. Logically there shouldn’t have been any difference in attendance. Not only did all the groups presumably have similar inclinations to attend when they bought their tickets, they all were ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=810))

- prepared to pay the same price and all had the same tickets, on average, as the season progressed. Although this phenomenon tended to lessen—predictably—as the theater season progressed (farther away from the date of purchase), the experiment’s conclusion is unavoidable: The more people spent on their tickets, the greater their sunk costs, and the more seriously they took attendance at the plays. Arkes and Blumer tried to explain why sunk costs have such a powerful effect on people, beyond the obvious, if irrational, notion of loss aversion: If people didn’t go to a performance, they likely equated the unused ticket with a loss. Therefore the higher their ticket price, the greater the loss to be averted and the greater the likelihood ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=830))

- that they’d expend effort to see the performances. No matter that the money was already spent whether they went to the play or stayed home and lazed on the couch. One of the more interesting suggestions the researchers made—which we’re inclined to agree with—is that people fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy because they don’t want to appear wasteful. Not necessarily to other people, mind you; most people act as their own judge and jury when it comes to their own finances. In any case, Arkes and Blumer buttressed their point with the results from the following scenario, which was posed… ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=835))

You call up your friend to ask if he would like to come over for a quick TV dinner and then watch a good movie on TV. Your friend says sure. You go out to buy a second TV dinner. However, all the on-sale TV dinners are gone. You therefore have to spend $5 (the regular price) for the TV dinner identical to the one you just bought for $3. You go home and put both dinners in the oven. When the two dinners are fully cooked, you get a phone call. Your friend is ill and cannot come. You are not hungry enough to eat both dinners.

- Not surprisingly, most survey participants had no preference, since the costs and benefits of choosing either dinner are the same: You’ve spent eight bucks, and no matter which dinner you eat, one of the meals will go to waste. Amazingly, though, around one quarter said they would eat the $5 dinner, a choice that Arkes and Blumer suggested could only be the result of those folks having the impression that throwing away a $5 meal would be more wasteful than throwing away a $3 meal. (As for the two people who said they would eat the $3 meal, your guess is as good as ours.) ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=846))

- Whatever the causes of the sunk cost fallacy, the importance of ignoring money already spent and focusing on future costs and benefits should be obvious. If it’s not, ask yourself how many times you’ve opted to repair a car or furnace, or to spend money on some other endeavor, based largely on the fact that you’ve already invested so much. Here’s a personal example from our files: When Gary was in college and learning to play hockey, he bought a pair of goaltender leg pads for $350. Truth be told, Gary discovered quickly that he had little potential as a goalie. But when the time came to buy more equipment, he opted to purchase skates, sticks, gloves, and shoulder pads that were designed especially for goaltenders. Why? Because he had already spent such a large amount on the leg pads, and because facing up to his weakness in goal was difficult. You won’t be surprised to hear the conclusion to this tale: Eventually ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=850))

That leaves you with two options: (1) keep your money under a mattress and hope you save enough during your career to last in retirement; or (2) take some risk and invest your money in assets that have a reasonable chance to increase in value over time. For most people (1) isn’t really an option, if only because most people can’t save enough after living expenses to support themselves in retirement, especially during eras (like the current one) when inflation exists and erodes the buying power of money. That leaves (2), and since you have to do something with your money, the challenge is picking the assets with which to cast your lot. And that brings us full circle.

(A lot of nonfinancial mistakes, too, for that matter.) It’s not always what you do that hurts your pocketbook, but what you choose not to do. To explain why people decide not to decide—or, more accurately, why people resist change—we return once again to the spadework of behavioral economics pioneers Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Prospect theory, as we saw earlier, helps explain how loss aversion and an inability ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1021))

- to ignore sunk costs lead people to act in ways that are not in their best interest. The sting of losing money, for example, often leads investors to pull out of the stock market unwisely when prices dip. Similarly, it leads car owners to pay for expensive repairs because of money already spent on previous fixes. Both examples show how loss aversion and the sunk cost fallacy often lead us to take action—to actually do something. But prospect theory also explains how those same tendencies can lead us to avoid or delay action. Indeed, loss aversion and several other factors—particularly the fear of regret and a preference for the familiar—contribute to a phenomenon we call “decision paralysis,” which makes the idea of many proactive decisions daunting and uncomfortable. So let’s examine the way people reach decisions—how choices are made generally and why you might decide not to decide. Once you’re familiar with all of the forces at work, you’ll better understand why choice and change can be intimidating. It’s a phenomenon that hampers people in all walks of life, from renting a car to buying a house to selecting a mate. Not surprisingly, the higher the stakes, the more conflict we feel. And for most of us, the stakes are never higher than when the choices involve money. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1025))

- Simon (Google him and be amazed)—represent the two primary ways most of us make decisions. Maximizers are folks who want to know everything about a choice. They spend a lot of time, effort, and emotion researching options in hopes of making the best choice possible. Satisficers, on the other hand, are looking for “good enough,” and they generally make choices through a combination of the best available information, gut instinct, and the advice from what we like to call “trusted screeners” (more on that in the advice part of this chapter). Of course, some people have more maximizing or satisficing tendencies than others, but nearly all of us act like maximizers in some circumstances and like satisficers in others. Studies suggest that maximizing is a positive trait because it can leave people more confident about their choices.

- that the search for decisive reasons can make people vulnerable to psychological tendencies of which they are unaware. Tversky and marketing professor Itamar Simonson demonstrated the impact of several of these tendencies in a key 1992 paper published in the Journal of Marketing Research. In one experiment, people were given pictures and descriptions of five microwave ovens taken from a popular catalog. After studying the offerings carefully—which you might want to do, too, since it’s a bit confusing—half the participants were asked to pick between two of these products: a… ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1149))

Meanwhile another group of participants was given three ovens from which to choose—the two already mentioned and a 1.1-cubic-foot Panasonic II, selling for 10 percent off its $199.99 price. Interestingly, the inclusion of the second Panasonic, not nearly as good a bargain as the other two, boosted the number of people who favored the Panasonic I. Some 60 percent chose the Panasonic I, while 27 percent chose the Emerson and 13 percent chose the Panasonic II. Tversky and Simonson explain this as an example of “trade-off contrast,” whereby choices are enhanced or hindered by the trade-offs between options—even options we wouldn’t choose anyway. In other words, when the Panasonic I was compared with the Emerson alone, few people had a decisive reason to choose one over the other; it was a trade-off between size (Panasonic) and price (Emerson). However, when the Panasonic II was introduced into the mix, the Panasonic I now had a couple of things going for it: Its size was adequate, and it could be had for a good price (35 percent off, as opposed to the 10 percent savings on the… ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1154))

The preferred choice? An even split—50 percent chose each model.

Ponder this for a moment: When all things were equal, only three in ten people chose munis as their preferred investment. Yet once they were told that they already owned these securities—even though they had not chosen that investment themselves—nearly half the people decided that munis were the way to go. This is a classic example of the status quo bias.

Whatever value you might have placed on, say, a stereo at a store will likely increase once it sits in your den.

After all, caution can be as much a positive force in your life as a negative influence, if it keeps you from making unwise decisions rather than beneficial ones. Only you can determine if an inability to pull the trigger on decisions costs or saves you money. But if you perceive choice conflict as a problem for you, here are seven helpful ideas to keep in mind: ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1328))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Play your own devil’s advocate. A simple way to make decisions more easily is to change your frame of reference. One method we have found helpful is to approach decisions from a neutral state. In other words, force yourself to imagine that you’re starting from ground zero rather than from a status quo position. For example, in the Ford/Toyota scenario mentioned earlier, Fred probably approached his choice as a decision to stick with or abandon his stock in Toyota. A more helpful way to have evaluated his choice would be to imagine that his money was invested in neither stock. His decision would then be this: In which automobile maker do I want to invest, Ford or Toyota? In most cases such an approach would allow Fred to evaluate the two companies on their merits, rather than weighting the evaluation in favor of Toyota because it occupied the status quo position. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1363))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Another way to alter your decision-making frame is to reverse the choice perspective. That is, turn a decision of which option to reject into one of which option to select, and vice versa. This should help you focus on both the positive and negative attributes of your options, rather than give too much weight to one or the other. For example, if you’re deciding among investment options and you find yourself unable to choose which one you prefer, ask yourself instead which options you would in no instance choose. Or, assume instead that you already own all the choices. Now your decision becomes which one to sell—which ones you definitely do not want to own. This is pretty simple. The hard part is recognizing that your decision is hampered by the way you’re viewing the problem to begin with.

A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure and a passion for detail.” Which occupation is Steve currently more likely to have: that of a salesman or that of a librarian? If you’re like most people—at least like most of the people to whom Richard Thaler has put this question over the years—you cast your vote for Librarian Steve. After all, aren’t librarians shy and reserved, while salespeople are sociable extroverts? Maybe, maybe not. But without even debating the merits of these stereotypes, there’s a more fundamental reason why choosing books over sales as Steve’s profession may be ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1466))

Sure, a neighbor described Steve in a way that seems to make him ill-suited for a life of sales, but one person’s opinion hardly outweighs the fact that, on statistical grounds, Steve is more than eighty times more likely to be a salesman than a librarian. And while most people don’t have easy access to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the notion that sales-people far outnumber librarians is probably obvious to you—as is the idea that among the millions of people in sales, there are probably hundreds of thousands who don’t match the conventional image of that profession.

To whom would you give the ball for the last shot of the game? We suspect that the majority of sports fans, and nearly every-one else as well, would probably give the ball to the player who has made ten shots in a row.

Imagine three playing cards laying facedown on the table, two black (representing the goats) and one red (the car). Now imagine that you pick one of the cards. At that moment, would you bet that you had picked a black or red card? Assuming you answered black, since the odds are two to one that you picked the darker color, you must now assume that of the two remaining cards, one is black and one is red.

Whether you understand the Let’s Make a Deal conundrum or not, it is our belief that most folks don’t understand the role of chance in everyday life. Tom proves this point to his students in the following way. He asks each member of the class to write down a mock series of twenty random coin flips and to represent that series on a piece of paper using X s and O s for heads and tails, respectively. One student, however, is told to actually flip a coin twenty times and write down his or her results. The challenge for Tom, who leaves the classroom during this exercise, is to examine the evidence upon his return and determine which among the many pieces of paper contained the results of the real-life coin flips. Invariably, Tom manages to identify the real-life coin flips. How? The real series of flips nearly always contains the longest streak of either heads or tails, perhaps looking something like this actual series of flips: OXXXXXOXOOXOOXOOXOOX. The imagined series of flips, meanwhile, often look like this: XXOXOOOXOOXOXXOOXXOO.

- Marketers count on this. That’s why they spend billions of dollars on advertising; merely getting a product or brand anchored in your head may boost the odds that you’ll purchase it, and once you’re a customer, the confirmation bias might keep you loyal for a while. No matter if it’s mutual funds or mattresses, cornflakes or cars, the hope is that you’ll be lured into developing a positive bias for that product and thus view subsequent information in a positive light. And, often enough, that’s just what happens. But brand loyalty—a stepchild of the confirmation bias—may cost you thousands of dollars. Here’s why: Once you’ve developed a bias for, say, Hondas, you’re more likely to view information about Hondas in a favorable light and to view any data about Nissans less favorably. One especially relevant piece of information is price, and the findings of a study by marketing professor Dick R.

In their study, the two men found that people could not shake the anchor of prices in their previous real estate market when they moved to a new one: Newcomers from more expensive cities rented pricier apartments than those arriving from less-costly cities, a phenomenon that held true regardless of individual wealth, taxes, or other such reasons. So people who left expensive cities for cheaper ones tended to buy more house than they seemed to need (or ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1838))

- Have you ever been married or engaged or considered either? How much do you think a diamond engagement ring should cost? For many of you, the answer is “two months’ salary.” That’s the rule of thumb most people use for answering that question, a rule promoted by the diamond industry in ad campaigns and informational material. It’s a completely ridiculous figure—a ring should cost no more than you can afford! But it has become a standard reference point for engagement ring purchases. Diamond merchants, you see, understand that by leading people to start with a dollar figure equal to two months’ salary, they almost certainly guarantee more money for their industry. Why? Because anyone who might have spent less for a ring will have been programmed to think that two months’ pay is the point below which he’s being a cheapskate (and what man wants his fiancée to think that?). They’ll anchor on the equivalent dollar figure if they don’t know that this is happening—or even if they do. Meanwhile people who would likely spend more than two months’ salary will do so anyway—they’ll assume the benchmark is for people who don’t have as much money as they do or don’t love their fiancées as much.

Most people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of anchoring when they know precious little about the commodity in question.

The anchor is not actively resisted because one doesn’t know any better.

One of them—a very old vase—seemed expensive at a price in U.S. dollars of about $500. Marge explained that the shop owner had been asking $1,000 for the vase, but after considerable bargaining, she had persuaded him to halve the price.

- bought the vase at a significant discount. This, of course, is a classic example of anchoring: Marge knew the asking price was artificial and unrealistic, but by starting the bidding at $1,000, the shop owner had anchored that figure as the reference point for the vase’s value. This doesn’t mean that Marge was ripped off; she was happy. It’s just a reminder that a discount is only a discount if you would have been willing to pay a higher price for the item in question. If Marge wouldn’t have paid any more than $500 for the vase—or if she could have found it for less elsewhere—then the real discounting should have started at that figure.

- On the “sell side,” anchoring can cause you to fix on a figure—say, your original purchase price—and cling to it irrationally. This is another factor behind the phenomenon we discussed earlier, whereby many people tend to hold on to losing investments longer than winning ones. If you buy a stock for $50 a share, that amount becomes your anchor when evaluating the worth of the stock down the road. In fact, it’s not even necessary for you to have bought the stock to anchor on a price. In 2007, the stock of Garmin, which makes navigation devices, peaked at just under $78 a share. Subsequently, when the share price fell to below $66 in 2008, many investors thought the stock “looked cheap” compared with its all-time high, and they rushed to invest.

Even if the current finances or future prospects of a company in question have changed so that its shares have justifiably dropped in value, it’s difficult to erase the original purchase price (or highest price) from memory.

While that’s true, certain tendencies—particularly those discussed in this chapter—are very tough to alter. We’ve already seen how people find it difficult to ignore certain anchors even when they know the value presented to them is designed specifically to mislead. You might know what a fair price is not, but that doesn’t necessarily tell you what a fair price is or how much to adjust from that initial unfair value. The confirmation bias we discussed earlier is also hard to overcome because most people do not find it natural to do what is necessary to overcome it—which is to deliberately seek answers ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1942))

Most people choose Cards A and 2, or Card A alone, apparently in an effort to prove the statement true. They look at a vowel card to see if there is an even number on the flip side and look at an even number card to see if there is a vowel on the other side of that. The problem, though, is that even if both cards turn out to support the rule, that’s not enough. Why? Because there could be a vowel on the other side of Card 3, which would mean that not all cards with a vowel on one side have an… ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=1947))

- there’s not a vowel there). The irony, of course, is that our explanation may be hard to understand because of the very issue we’re trying to explain. Because people’s natural bias is to confirm what they already “know” or think they know, they reflexively try to prove a rule by looking for facts that would support it rather than looking for information that might contradict it. That’s why a lot of people say that ignoring Card 2 is wrong, because you could flip it over and discover a consonant on the other side of Card 2. But even if that turns out to be true, so what? All that proves is that a card with a consonant on one side may have an even number on the other; it doesn’t prove or disprove the statement that all vowel cards have even numbers on the opposite side. Still a little confused? Don’t worry.

When people do not want to believe something, in contrast, they ask themselves, “Must I believe this?” This is a much higher hurdle to overcome because the tiniest flaw in some body of evidence can be seized upon to condemn the proposition.

- Finally, be humble. One of the reasons people think so highly of themselves is that they often don’t recognize when they’ve been wrong. Even when events prove a decision foolish, people frequently explain it away and emerge with their confidence intact. Stockbrokers, in fact, have a joke about this tendency, which goes something like this: “When the price goes up, the client thinks he picked a great stock. When the price drops, the client knows that his broker sold him a lousy one.” People have an impressive knack for snatching subjective victory from the jaws of objective defeat. To be sure, faith in one’s judgment—believing in your ability to make decisions that are in your best interest—is a crucial element to personal progress. But too much faith and too much confidence can lead you to unwise and unproductive decisions. As you’ll read in the next chapter, overconfidence is more common than you might imagine.

That premise, of course, is that individuals like you can learn from your mistakes. By identifying and understanding your behavioral-economic shortcomings, you can correct them and enjoy more financial freedom. This chapter, though, is a cautionary tale, like the yellow flag that’s waved to warn race-car drivers that conditions are a bit treacherous. The core idea of this chapter is not particularly uplifting: You’re probably not as smart as you think you are. That’s okay; neither are we. Few people are. As a matter of fact, for almost as long as psychologists have been exploring human nature, they have been amassing evidence that people tend to overestimate their own abilities, knowledge, and skills. In a favorable light, this might be called optimism, and it’s a propelling force in human achievement. It’s also a bracing, cheerful way to go through life. After all, who wants to read their children a bedtime story whose main character is a train that says, “I doubt I can, I doubt I can”?

Because people are certain they know what the Immaculate Conception refers to—the idea that Jesus was conceived without his parents, Mary and Joseph, having consummated their marriage—they are supremely confident they can win the proffered bet. In fact, the Immaculate Conception refers to the dogma that when Mary was conceived, she was brought into this world without the stain of Original Sin; her soul was immaculate.

- There are two other barriers we must overcome if this chapter is to be successful. Even if we sell you on the notion that overconfidence is common and troublesome, there’s a good chance that you’ll think it’s not really a problem for you. The very tendency we’re writing about could make you overly confident that overconfidence is not one of your issues. First, overconfidence is not always arrogance; even if you already think you’re a lousy shopper, you might be worse than you think. Second, overconfidence often appears as unrealistically high appraisals of our own qualities versus those of others. The classic example of this tendency is seen in a 1981 survey of car drivers in Sweden, in which 90 percent described ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2054))

If you are like most people, your reaction is typically one of alarm, even horror: “You’re kidding!

- And if you think about it, signs of overconfidence are rampant in all walks of life, particularly when it comes to money. If people were not overconfident, for example, significantly fewer people would ever start a new business: Most entrepreneurs know the odds of success are against them, yet they try anyway. That their optimism is misplaced—that they’re overconfident—is evidenced by the fact that half of all small businesses fail within five years of inception. Put another way, the majority of small-business owners believe that they have what it takes to overcome the obstacles to success, but most of them are wrong.

- about conscious arrogance, although overconfidence might certainly manifest itself in such out-and-out hubris. It’s not so much that some folks think they are especially gifted and some folks do not, although that is certainly true. Rather, what research psychologists have discovered about overconfidence is that most people—those with healthy egos and those in the basement of self-esteem—consistently overrate their abilities, knowledge, and skill, at whatever level they might place them. If you asked Gary and Kobe Bryant to predict how many free throws they will make out of a hundred tries, Gary might honestly predict thirty-five and Kobe might answer ninety. Both would likely be suffering from overconfidence. Over the years, researchers have demonstrated the pervasiveness of this phenomenon in myriad ways. One of the more famous efforts was a series of studies in the 1970s. Participants were first required to answer a few simple factual questions (for example, “Is Quito the capital of Ecuador?”) and then to estimate the probability that their answers were correct (for instance, “I’m 60 percent sure that Quito is Ecuador’s capital”). Consistently, participants overestimated the… ([Location 2080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2080))

- Which brings us to the real meat of this chapter, a point that if made successfully will cause us to consider this whole enterprise a success. Our point has to do with investing, and it’s bound to be seen by some as the most controversial statement in this book, the one most sure to raise eyebrows among readers. Here it is: Any individual who is not professionally occupied in the financial services industry (and even most who are) and who in any way tries to actively manage an investment portfolio is probably suffering from overconfidence. That is, anyone who has confidence enough in his or her abilities and knowledge to invest in a particular stock or bond (or actively managed mutual fund or real estate investment trust or limited partnership) is most likely fooling himself. In fact, most such people (probably you) have no business at all trying to pick investments, except perhaps as sport. Such people (again, probably you) should simply divide their money among several index mutual funds, then turn off CNBC and block most financial Web sites. The best that such people (yes, you) should hope for is to match the average performance of the stock and bond markets over their investing life. Such a result ain’t too bad.

- Okay, now that we’ve insulted you sufficiently, let’s go over our case, which at its essence is that most individual investors have no business thinking they can pick stocks or bonds with any more success than Tom and Gary would have playing doubles at Wimbledon. Consider the following for a moment: As we saw earlier, the typical mutual fund manager—someone who spends every day in pursuit of brilliant investment ideas—will over the course of time be quite lucky if he or she manages simply to match the overall performance of the stock market. In fact, in most years the majority of these professional money managers actually perform worse than stocks in general. Indeed, over periods of a decade or more, roughly 75 percent of all stock funds underperform the market. ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2200))

- Yes, a few fund managers consistently outperform the market over time, and yes, a small number of investors have become famous over the years for exceptional stock picking. But the operative words here are few and small. The fact of the matter is that most people have no reason to think they can be more successful identifying worthy investments or timing the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets than they would be if they made their decisions by throwing darts at the financial pages. That fact was emphasized more than a decade ago in a study by Terrance Odean and Brad Barber. The two researchers, you might recall from earlier in the book, have spent a great deal of time in recent years analyzing the trading records of tens of thousands of individual investors at a large national discount brokerage firm. One of their conclusions, which we discussed earlier, was that individual investors routinely sold winning stocks and held on to losers. In later work, Odean and Barber turned up an equally important find: that individuals who trade stocks most frequently post exceptionally poor investment results. Using account data for tens of thousands of households, Odean and Barber analyzed the common stock… ([Location 2205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2205))

- More important, the 20 percent of households that traded the most—turning over roughly 10 percent of their portfolio each month, vs. 6.6 percent for all households—earned an average annual return of just 10 percent. Think about this for a minute. It’s no stretch to assume that the people who traded the most did so because they believed their stock-picking skills to be superior to those of the average investor. In fact, a study in 1998 by the German economists Markus Glaser and Martin Weber proved that more confident investors tended to trade more often. But the performance of investors in Odean and Barber’s study was… ([Location 2216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2216))

- soon see, the average individual investor in mutual funds consistently fares worse than the average mutual fund, as hard as that may be to believe. Several traits contribute to this startling fact, but it is our belief that a major reason most individual investors underperform the benchmark investment averages over time is that most individual investors think they know more about investing than they actually do. The question is why? Not why are people overconfident to begin with, but why do they stay overconfident? You see, the problem with overconfidence is not the innate bias toward optimism that most people seem to possess. That’s a good thing; it keeps the world moving forward. The real problem is the inability to temper optimism as a result of prior experience. Frankly, we don’t learn well enough from our mistakes. Consider: If overconfidence is as big a problem as we say it is, it should be a short-term problem at worst. The learning process would ideally go something like this: We think highly of ourselves, the world and events show us who is boss, and we become less confident and more realistic about our knowledge and skills.

In a series of landmark experiments, Fischhoff asked students at Hebrew University to speculate about the upcoming, historic visit to China by U.S. president Richard Nixon.

With events that they remembered as having taken place, students consistently recalled their predictions as being more optimistic. And with events they remembered as not having occurred, they recalled their predictions as being more pessimistic. Tetlock, the psychologist who collected all that data on “expert” predictions, found a similar tendency among those prognosticators; they systematically distorted the likelihood they… ([Location 2248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00321OR9E&location=2248))

But here’s how overconfidence is preserved: Even when you remember your defeats, you may remember them in a way that alters their perceived implications for the future.

Conversely, when things happen that prove your actions or beliefs to have been mistaken or wrongheaded, you attribute those disconfirming events to some other cause over which you had no control.

- This idea—invest in what you know—became increasingly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, associated with such investing legends as Peter Lynch, manager of the highly successful Fidelity Magellan mutual fund for thirteen years, and Warren Buffett, longtime chairman of the even more successful Berkshire Hathaway holding company. Indeed, it is often recounted how Lynch loved the coffee at Dunkin’ Donuts and made a fortune investing in the company’s stock or how Buffett’s addiction to cherry Coke was a key component in his decision to invest in Coca-Cola shares before the company’s stock exploded. Similarly, the invest-in-what-you-know approach is at least partly responsible for the fact that employees typically allocate more than a third of their retirement account assets to the stock of the company for which they work, despite the risks of such a strategy: Your biggest investment—your job—is already tied to the fortunes of your workplace, so by stashing retirement assets in company stock, you’re putting too many eggs in one basket. That’s why most financial planning pros recommend you keep no more than 10 percent of your 401(k) assets in your own company’s shares.

- In any event, the problem with all of this is that people overconfidently confuse familiarity with knowledge. For every example of a person who made money on an investment because she used a company’s product or understood its strategy, we can give you five instances where such knowledge was insufficient to justify the investment. A classic example is American Express. It’s safe to say that many Platinum card-holders were convinced that the company’s service, strategy, and customer base were superior to those of its competitors, and as a result, many of them invested in Amex’s shares with exceeding confidence. What these investors couldn’t foresee was that Amex was as vulnerable to credit problems as many other financial institutions, and its stock plummeted precipitously when the global economy hit the skids.

Conversely, many investors will pay higher and higher prices for stocks (or paintings or real estate or anything else) simply because other people they don’t know are willing to pay such prices.
