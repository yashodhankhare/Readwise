## Highlights
- One paradox I often pose to my audiences in talks about the elements of successful trading concerns the dichotomy in human thinking as it relates to trading versus everything else. Specifically, I use the following example: No sane person would walk into a bookstore (assuming you could still find one these days), go to the medical section, find a book on brain surgery, read it over the weekend, and then believe he could walk into an operating room on Monday morning and perform successful brain surgery. The operative word here is “sane.” Yet how many people do you know who would think that it is perfectly reasonable to walk into a bookstore, go the investment section, find a book with a title like How I Made a Million Dollars Trading Stocks Last Year, read it over the weekend, and then start trading Monday morning and expect to beat the professionals at their own game. Why this dichotomy in thinking? The foregoing paradox is one that I believe has a satisfactory answer. Trading, as far as I know, is the only endeavor in which the rank amateur has a 50/50 chance of being right. Why? Because there are only two things you could do in trading: you can buy or you can sell. And, as a consequence, some portion of clueless beginners will get it right simply by chance—for a while. This potential for temporary success by pure luck beguiles people into thinking that trading is a lot easier than it is. The potential for even temporary success doesn’t exist in any other profession. If you have never trained as a surgeon, the probability of your performing successful brain surgery is zero. If you have never picked up a violin, your chances of playing successful solo violin in front of the New York Philharmonic are zero. It is just that trading has this quirk that allows some people to be successful temporarily without true skill or an edge—and that fools people into mistaking luck for skill.

- The truth is that trading, both successful and unsuccessful, is more about psychology than tactics. As Jim Paul ultimately learns through a very expensive lesson taught by the market, successful trading is not about discovering a great strategy for making money but rather a matter of learning how to lose. From the research he conducts following his catastrophic experience in the markets, Paul realizes that winning traders differ radically, using approaches that often contradict one another. What winning traders share, however, is that they all understand that losing is part of the game, and they all have learned how to lose. By losing everything, Paul becomes an expert on losing, and it is only then that he can become a winning trader rather than a temporarily lucky one.

- The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built upon repeated failures when the failures aren’t taken personally; likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the successes are taken personally. Thomas Edison failed roughly 10,000 times before finding the right filament to make an electric light bulb. The day his Menlo Park laboratory burned to the ground a reporter asked him what he was going to do. Edison responded, “Start rebuilding tomorrow.” In part, Edison succeeded because he didn’t take failures or losses personally. On the other hand, consider Henry Ford, who worked with and greatly admired Edison. Ford started in 1905 with nothing and in fifteen years had built the largest and most profitable manufacturing firm on the planet. Yet a few years later, this seemingly impregnable business empire was in shambles and would go on to lose money almost every year for the next two decades. Ford was known to stick uncompromisingly to his opinions; is it possible his company lost so much money because he took the successes personally and came to think he could do no wrong? Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees success. This phenomenon has been called many things: hubris, overconfidence, arrogance. But the way in which successes become personalized and the processes that precipitate the subsequent failure have never been clearly spelled out. That is what we have set out to do.

- WHY A BOOK ON LOSING? ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=115))

- Personality-journalism books are definitely read for entertainment, not as an attempt to learn from the subject’s mistakes. Losing has received only superficial coverage in most books on the markets; they raise the subject, stress its importance, and then leave it dangling. What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars is a light treatise on the psychology of losing and is intended for investors, speculators, traders, brokers, and money managers who have either lost money or would like to protect against losing what they’ve made. Most discussions of the psychological aspects of the markets focus on behavioral psychology or psychoanalysis (i.e., sublimation, regression, suppression, anger, self-punishment). This isn’t to say such books aren’t instructive; it’s just that most people find it hard to digest and apply the information presented in those books.

- One of the premises of this book is that the rise sets up the fall; the winning sets up the losing. You can’t really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by success. If you go into a situation in a neutral position, having neither successes nor failures beforehand, you acknowledge that your odds are maybe fifty-fifty; you may have a winner, you may have loser. But if you start from scratch and have a run of successes, you are setting yourself up for the coming failure because the successes lead to a variety of psychological distortions. This is particularly true if you have unknowingly broken the rules of the game and won anyway. Once that happens to you, you think that you are somehow special and exempt from following the rules. The seeds of Jim’s disaster were sown with his first job at the age of nine. His exposure to the outside world, money, and material things was the foundation for his career’s sharp and quick ascent as well as its ultimate collapse. Repeated attempts to make the money back by speculating in the markets ended in failure and left Jim disillusioned. He set out on a quest to find out how the pros made money in the markets so he could follow their example. When you’re sick you want to consult the best doctors; when you’re in trouble you want the best lawyers; so Jim read all about the techniques of the professionals to learn their secret of making money. But this search left him even more disillusioned since he discovered that the masters made money not only in widely varying ways but also in ways that contradicted each other. What one market pro advocated, another ardently opposed. It finally occurred to him that studying losses, losing, and how not to lose was more important than studying how to make money. The second part of the book presents the lessons Jim learned from his losing experience. Namely, there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in the markets, but there are relatively few ways to lose money in the markets. People lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological factors that prevent the application of the analysis. Most of the losses are due to the latter. All analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for the times when they won’t work. But psychological factors can keep you in a losing position and also cause you to abandon one method for another when the first one produces a losing position. The third part of the book shows you how to avoid the losses due to psychological factors. Trading and investment mistakes are well known and easily understood but difficult to correct. What you need is not a long litany of complex psychological theories but a simple framework to help you understand, accept, and thereby avoid catastrophic losses. This book will help you recognize, identify, and avoid the pitfalls of investing, trading, and speculating. So, why a book on losing? Because, there are as… ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=138))

- Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the success as a personal reflection rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky. People begin to think their mere involvement in the undertaking guarantees success. Apparently, this is a common phenomenon. Listen to An Wang, founder of Wang Laboratories: “I find it somewhat surprising that so many talented people derail themselves one way or another during their lives … all too often a meteoric rise triggers a precipitous fall. People fail for the most part because they shoot themselves in the foot. If you go for a long time without shooting yourself in the foot, other people start calling you a genius.”2 Listen to Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines: “I think the easiest way to lose success is to become convinced that you are successful.”3 This “becoming convinced” is the process of personalizing achievements or successes. Learning to recognize and prevent that process is what this book is all about. When I was a kid, my father told me there are two kinds of people in the world: smart people and wise people. Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from somebody else’s mistakes. Anyone reading this book has a wonderful opportunity to become wise because I am now very, very smart. I learned a lot from the mistakes that led to a million-and-a-half-dollar loss in the market. But there is more to the story than the fantastic fall from the pinnacle of millionaire trader and member of the Executive Committee at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. There is the almost fantasy-like ascent to the top that set the stage for the collapse. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=199))

- If you weren’t exposed to this “other life,” you didn’t know it existed and you didn’t know you were missing it. The country club exposed me to the better things in life, and I wanted the better things. Well, that was a problem because once I learned about this “other life” and that it was better, I also knew that I was missing it. I was at a disadvantage to most of my peers because I wanted more than they even knew existed. I wanted to learn how to play golf. I wanted to be one of the guys caddies would come up to and say, “Good morning, Mr. Paul,” just like I had to say, “Good morning, Mr. Robkey.” I wanted to become one of these country-club guys, not one of those Joe Lunch Box guys. Basically, what I learned at the country club was: It’s not what you do for a living that’s important. What’s important is how much you get paid for doing it. I could work hard like Joe Lunch Box or I ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=268))

There was nothing personal about it. They didn’t know I existed when they wrote the rules so it was totally impersonal. You can either play the system or you can let the system play you. Pick one. I like playing the system because it’s more fun and you win more. If you let the system play you, you can get very frustrated and very beat up.

- The point was: I was laughing at all those guys in all the other classes because they couldn’t carry my jock strap in economics and marketing, and all of a sudden I couldn’t carry their jock straps in math. That taught me that there are people for places, places for people. You can do some things and you can’t do other things. Don’t get all upset about the things you can’t do. If you can’t do something, pay someone else who can and don’t worry about it. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=536))

- On my way out of the office, Fitzgerald’s secretary told me to come back the next day to fill out an application and take a test. “Test? What kind of test?” I asked. She said it was called the Minnesota Study of Values Test. Without knowing it, she had just let me know that there was a game to be played. This time the game was a test. I didn’t know anything about this test, but I planned to find out about it. I went straight to a bookstore and found a book titled The Brain Watchers that had three chapters on the Minnesota Study of Values Test. I bought the book and read it that night so I’d be ready for the test the next day. The questions on the MSV Test have five multiple-choice answers that you rank in their order of importance to you. The five categories of answers are Money, Politics, Aesthetics, Religion, and Social Significance. For example, one question I remember was: When you look at Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper, what do you feel? Rank the following in their order of importance, 1 being the most important and 5 being the least important. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=556))

- The social implications of the event, The beauty of the painting, The value of the painting, The political impact of the painting, The religious ramifications of the painting. Depending on what kind of job you are applying for, there is a right way and a wrong way to rank the answers. If you want to be a broker, the ranking for the question above is as follows: the highest ranking is the money answer, followed by the politics answer, social significance, aesthetics, and finally the religion answer. If you want to go to work as a parish priest, every right first answer is the religion answer, then social, and so on, and the money answer is always last. Once you know that’s how their game is played, the test isn’t hard. It’s very simple. You can see very quickly which one of the five choices represents each of the categories; then you just rank them the way you believe the employer wants them ranked.

- I was walking into the lumber pit every day with big orders. “Buy fifty of this. Sell one hundred of that.” When you start doing size like that in the pit, it can really do to your head; the other people in the pit don’t know whether the orders are for your account or for a client’s. It also makes it very easy to start trading that kind of size for your own account. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=751))

For example, when I was sent to Korea and became an S-3 as a second lieutenant, was it because I was good or lucky? Lucky. Everyone else was sent to Vietnam, so there was a personnel shortage in Korea. When I happened into that brokerage the day after Cohan’s assistant quit, was it because I was good or lucky? Lucky.

- With interest rates skyrocketing in 1979 and 1980, the housing market, and consequently the lumber market, felt the pinch. The high interest rates depressed new homes sales, the main market for lumber. Lumber prices plunged, and volume in the lumber pit dried up. It went from about 6,000 contracts a day down to 1,000. I don’t care what your market share is; when the market shrinks by that amount, you’ve got problems. There was no longer enough business in lumber futures for me to maintain my lifestyle.

- Gleasman was nuts—he was constantly coming up with these ideas. Every week he’d have a new way to make a million dollars. One day he started talking about Arabian horses. “You buy these beautiful horses and you breed them and you show them in horse shows and you make a lot of money.” “Are you sure that’s right?” “Yeah.” I never could get a handle on why or how you made a lot of money with these horses. These things don’t do anything. They don’t race or run the steeplechase—nothing. They’re show horses.

- $2 million for this thing that walks around looking pretty. Sounded crazy to me, but Gleasman and I started looking at Arabian horses. He came up to me one day and said, “I’ve got it. I found a couple who are getting divorced, and they’re selling everything they own in common to settle their divorce decree. They have an Arabian horse we can buy for $22,000.” This was the first number he’d mentioned that I could even think about paying for a horse that didn’t do anything. So we went and saw this horse. His name was Onyx. Onyx was beautiful. Gorgeous. A dark gray Arabian. He had this pedigree and that pedigree, and so on. “Okay, let’s do it. Buy the horse. What’s it gonna cost?” The minute you buy one of these things, the cash register just starts running. We had to transport it over to the stables, pay for room and board, pay the vet, and pay for training. After a few months, it was getting to be kind of expensive. We had something like $20,000 each in Onyx. Then one day I got a call from Gleasman. “It’s Onyx,” he said. “What do you mean, it’s Onyx?” “They just checked Onyx into the emergency room of the Ohio State equine hospital.” ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=798))

- “Ah, God. Now what?” “He’s got a rare blood disease.” Naturally, we hadn’t insured Onyx yet. We figured that after training him and documenting his pedigree, he was going to be worth more and we’d be able to insure him for a lot more. The SOB ran through another thirty grand before he died. The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn’t even ride one.

- One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if you’re long. An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is something seriously wrong with the position. Two consecutive limit down days following the release of a supposedly bullish government report does not indicate a strong market. Faced with that situation, what did these two bold and committed traders do? Get out or confidently hold onto their position and opinion? That’s right! We decided the market was wrong, and we were not going to let them get us out of this great position. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=886))

- THE DEATH-KNELL PHONE CALL The high from “being right” the market and making all that money is unbelievable. It cannot be duplicated with drugs. You are totally invincible. You are impervious to all pain. There’s nothing bad in the world. It’s literally like you expect God to call any minute and ask, “Is it okay if I let the sun come up tomorrow morning?” And after thinking about it for a minute you’ll probably say, “Yeah, go ahead.” I called Smith and we mutually congratulated each other on our wisdom and knowledge and for all the money we were now going to make—not the money we had made but the money we were going to make. We immediately accepted the money we had made and assumed that it was in our bank accounts. It was ours. We weren’t even saying, “Isn’t it neat that we made an unconscionable amount of money today?” That was a given. We were talking about all the money we were going to make. That day simply confirmed that we were right. I’ll never forget going into Larry’s house that afternoon and picking up a copy of The Robb Report. Originally a magazine that listed used Rolls Royces for sale, it grew into the magazine to list ridiculously expensive things for sale: real estate for $5,000,000 and up, hunting lodges, estates, whole islands for sale. Everything in this magazine was the most expensive of its kind. If it were selling pens, they’d be priced at $500 each. There was a section on motor homes, and the Rolls Royce of motor homes was a thing called a Blue Bird Wanderlodge. I was sitting in the house, looking through The Robb Report, and honestly thinking about buying a $400,000 motor home. Why would anyone spend a half a million dollars for a bus? You’d have to be nuts. I was nuts! I was really thinking about buying this bus. Friday morning I got up, went straight to the quote machine, and sat on the edge of my seat moments before the market opened, saying, “Come on guys, open this sucker. Let’s get going. I want to make some more money.” I literally assumed I was going to make more money. The question was not whether I was going to make money. The question was how much money was I going to make. There was a total presumption of success; what had gone before would continue. The market opened and the spreads corrected about ten points or so from the previous day’s huge rally. But that was $30,000 on my position! “No big deal,” I thought to myself. (Here’s another sign of having lost control. Here’s someone who has lost $30,000 and is saying, “Hmmm. That’s not so bad.” That’s a little nuts. Right? I’d just lost $30,000 in the first five minutes of Friday and I was feeling fine. “No problem. Too bad we can’t buy more of these.”) The market came back during the day from down ten to up thirty points, and did it right on the close. Bang! The spreads went our way again. Perfect! You couldn’t have written the script any better. Now we had Richard Dennis trapped over the weekend—or at least we thought we did. We actually had the chutzpah to… ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=910))

The clients I advised were sophisticated and experienced traders in their own right, and they had been bailing out of the market since early September. As far as I was concerned, this demonstrated their lack of courage to buy with pride and hold with conviction. Naturally, I didn’t get out. I was in for the long pull. This was going to be the Big Trade. The world was going to run out of bean oil, maybe even mayonnaise, and Smith and I were going to make $10 million.

- VERTIGO For the next several weeks Smith and I kept telling each other, “It’s going to be all right.

Now that we understand that, it’s going to go away. We’re going to be okay.” We rationalized everything. It was like living in Tortilla Flat with Danny and his friends, rationalizing everything. “Yeah, we just heard that some big commercial firm has just taken some deliveries of bean oil, so if he’s stopping them then it must be okay now.” ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=981))

- Bean oil was now at twenty-nine cents, down from the September highs of thirty-seven cents. I’d lost most of my money. As the position got increasingly worse, I began to get margin calls. I’d be on margin call for two or three days at a time, but the firm’s attitude was, “We know you’re a big wheel. We know you’re on the Executive Committee at the CME, and we know you’re neat and you’ve got this fancy car. We know you’re good for the money.” I’d wait a few days to see if the market rallied. If it did, fine—I wouldn’t have to meet the margin call. If it didn’t, I’d spend the next couple of days trying to borrow money from my friends so I could meet the margin call. I gradually began to lose my outward cool. I was fighting with Pat and the kids; they had no idea what was happening. But it’s not uncommon for the spouses and families of traders not to know what’s going on with the trader’s market positions. I was skipping dinner so I wouldn’t have to face my family. I lost fifteen pounds. I couldn’t sleep. I was going to bed every night knowing I had to get up the next day and go watch this thing again. It was horrible. It would be a Friday, and I’d say, “Okay, it’s Friday. I can’t lose any more on this for another couple of days because the market won’t be open.” Weekends were welcomed. It was exactly opposite of when I was making money on that trade. When I was making money, I couldn’t wait for the market to open. When I was losing money, I couldn’t wait for it to close. Time is very painful when you’re losing money. All I wanted was for the market to rally back to the August highs, and I’d get out. We refused to accept the obvious: that we were going under. We were holding each other’s hands, and every day we went through this little drill of losing an average of $20,000 to $25,000 but telling ourselves that it was going to be all right. Naturally, it never was. It got to be excruciatingly painful. But I couldn’t get out of the market because as long as I had the position on, there was always the belief, the chance, the hope, that I could make back the money. If I got out of the market there wouldn’t be any chance anymore. “Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life. It’s going to turn—tomorrow.” It was always going to turn “tomorrow.” But it never did. By the first week in November, I was under water big time: $200,000 or $300,000. Bean oil was at… ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=988))

- Not only did I lose all of my money because of the stupid way I handled the bean-oil position, but I also discovered that I’d never really been a trader. Sure, I had made money in the markets, but it turned out that I really didn’t know how or why I had made it. I couldn’t duplicate the profits when I had to make a living strictly by trading. The money I’d made over the years “trading” wasn’t because I was a good trader. I’d made money because of being a good sales man, being at the right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than because of some innate trading ability. It was a painful realization to discover that I wasn’t a trader. I didn’t have the patience or mechanical skills to be a successful floor trader nor the consistency to be a successful upstairs trader. If I was going to learn how to make money trading I was going to have to find out how others had done it. I went and read the books and articles about and interviews with successful market professionals. I studied the best investors and traders from Wall Street and La Salle Street: Peter Lynch, Bernard Baruch, Jim Rogers, Paul Tudor Jones, Richard Dennis, and many more. After all, when you’re sick you want to consult the best doctors, and when you’re in trouble you want the advice of the best lawyers. So I consulted what the successful pros had to say about making money in the markets. If I could figure out how they did it, I could still pull off getting rich again. And this time I would keep the money. Here is some of the advice the pros offered for making money. Appendix A has brief dossier on these pros for those of you not familiar with their names. ADVICE AND DISSENT I haven’t met a rich technician.1 (Jim Rogers) I always laugh at people who say, ‘I’ve never met a rich technician.’ I love that! It is such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for nine years and then got rich as a technician.2 (Marty Schwartz) Not very encouraging! Okay, so maybe the key to success wasn’t whether you were a fundamentalist or a technician. I mean, I had made a lot of money using both of these methods. While I found technical analysis indispensable, there was nothing like a good fundamental situation to really make a market move. Maybe another topic would begin to reveal the pros’ secret. Diversify your investments.3 (John… ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1061))

- Buffett has made more than $1 billion in the market. Who was I to disagree with him? But Templeton is also one of the greatest investors alive, and he said something totally opposite of Buffett. Okay, so maybe diversification wasn’t the answer either. Maybe you could put all of your eggs in one basket and still get rich by watching the basket very closely. Perhaps the topics I had selected so far were too broad in their implications. Certainly, the pros would agree on the more specific and practical applications of investment and trading mechanics. AVERAGING A LOSS You have to understand the business of a company you have invested in, or you will not know whether to buy more if it goes down.6 (Peter Lynch) Averaging down is an amateur strategy that can produce serious losses.7 (William O’Neil) TOP AND BOTTOM PICKING Don’t bottom fish.8 (Peter Lynch) Don’t try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top.9 (Bernard Baruch) Maybe the trend is your friend for a few minutes in Chicago, but for the most part it is rarely a way to get rich.10 (Jim Rogers) I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve years I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have caught a lot of bottoms and tops.11 (Paul Tudor Jones) SPREADING UP When you’re not sure what is going to happen in the market it is wise to protect yourself by going short in something you think is overvalued.12 (Roy Neuberger) Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have both long and short positions—just in case I’m wrong.13 (Jim Rogers) I have tried being long a stock and short a stock in the same industry but generally found it to be unsuccessful.14 (Michael Steinhardt) Many traders have the idea that when they are in a commodity (or stock), and it starts to decline, they can hedge and protect themselves, that is, short some other commodity (or stock) and make up the loss. There is no greater mistake than this.15 (W. D. Gann) I had expected there might be some subtle differences among the pros. After all, some were stock-market moguls, while others traded options or futures contracts. But didn’t these guys agree on anything? Based on the examples above, they sounded more like members of a debate team trying to score points against one another. I had to find out how the pros made money in the markets. I had to learn the secret that all of them must know. But if the pros couldn’t agree on how to make money, how was I going to learn their secret? And then it began to occur to me: there was no secret. They didn’t all do the same thing to make money. What one guy said not to do, another guy said you should do. Why didn’t they agree? I mean, here was a group of individuals who had collectively taken billions of dollars out of the markets and kept it. Weren’t they all doing at least a few things the same when they made their money?… ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1091))

The most important thing in making money is not letting your losses get out of hand.17 (Marty Schwartz) I’m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money. Don’t focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.18 (Paul Tudor Jones)   One investor’s two rules of investing: Never lose money.

- Now I was getting somewhere. Why was I trying to learn the secret to making money when it could be done in so many different ways? I knew something about how to make money; I had made a million dollars in the market. But I didn’t know anything about how not to lose. The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all knew how to control their losses. While one person’s method was making money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing—if the second person was in the market. And that’s just it; the second person wouldn’t be in the market. He’d be on the sidelines with a nominal loss. The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose money. The moral, of course, is that just as there is more than one way to deal blackjack, there is more than one way to make money in the markets. Obviously, there is no secret way to make money because the pros… ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1149))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What started as a search for the secret to making money had turned into a search for the secret of how not to lose money. Why is it is so important to learn how not to lose? Because when people lose money in the markets, they usually look for a new approach to make money. Obviously, the previous method was defective; it’s never the investor’s or trader’s fault. Given the myriad of how-to methods, you could spend a lifetime trying, and failing, to make money with each one because you don’t know how not to lose. On the other hand, if you learn why people lose and thereby control losses, profits will follow. Basically, what I found is that there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people in the markets, but there are relatively few ways to lose money. When I say lose here, I don’t mean that there won’t be any losses. You don’t win every point in every game in every set in every match in tennis; you win some and you lose some. There will be lots of losses, just as there are losses in any business. Former Citicorp CEO Walter Wriston said that a lender who doesn’t have loan losses isn’t doing his job. And it’s the truth. Trying to avoid taking losses altogether is the loser’s curse. But the losses you are trying to avoid are the ones for which you hadn’t made allowances, the ones that sneak up on you and the ones that ultimately put you out of business.

- Losing money in the markets is the result of either: (1) some fault in the analysis or (2) some fault in its application. As the pros have demonstrated, there is no single sure-fire analytical way to make money in the markets. Therefore, studying the various analytical methods in search of the “best one” is a waste of time. Instead, what should be studied are the factors involved in applying, or failing to apply, any analytical method. Even when equipped with accurate analysis, correct forecasts, and profitable recommendations, people still manage to lose money.

- MARKET LORE TO IGNORE? Most remedies for market losses due to psychological factors are old market saws that are too ambiguous to offer any means of practical application. People recite these catchphrases as if they were self-evident truths. After repeating them so often they become trite clichés used out of unthinking habit. But pearls of trading wisdom are more easily repeated than implemented. Repeating maxims, as if mere verbalization will activate the underlying principles, will not work. For example, simply following the dictum “Don’t discuss market positions because the pros don’t,” won’t automatically make you a pro. You must understand those principles before you can benefit from the maxims. Pros don’t discuss their positions because they understand what triggers discussing positions in the first place, as well as the dangers of doing so. A maxim is a succinct formulation of some fundamental principle or rule of conduct. Memorizing and repeating clichés is easy; grasping their underlying principles is more difficult. For instance, consider what must be the most quoted maxim in the business: “Cut your losses short.” Sounds great, but what does it mean? Do you get out of a position as soon as it shows a loss? What constitutes a loss? How do you define a market loss? At some point in almost every investment or trade the position is going to show a loss, so how… ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1182))

Besides, doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing doesn’t guarantee success and there are times when “trading opposite the crowd” can wipe you out. And then there’s that oldie but goldie: “Don’t trade on hope or fear or make emotional decisions.” Sounds simple enough, but as you will see later in the book, emotions in general, and hope and fear specifically, create a unique paradox for the market participant. This book will not instruct you on the specifics of how to confront your fears or how to “get in touch with your feelings and emotions.” It will not reconcile your ego’s legitimate internal psychological needs with your participation in the markets. I don’t have a battery of tests for you to take to determine your particular psychological profile or your internal conflicts. I don’t have a test to determine if you should be participating in the markets at all. I am not, nor do I pretend to be, a psychologist. But I don’t have to be a psychologist to know that losses caused by psychological factors presuppose your ego’s involvement in the market position in the first place, which means you have… ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1195))

- Some of the ideas in the rest of the book may sound like semantic quibbling. However, it is precisely those confused semantics that are largely responsible for the confused thinking that, in turn, leads to the losses due to psychological factors. To clear up that confusion let’s attach clear, specific meanings to the terms we use. Let’s start at the beginning by defining psychology and seeing how it applies to us when we are in the market. The American Heritage Dictionary defines “psychology” as the study of the mental processes, behavioral characteristics, and emotions of an individual or group. Since we’re interested in market losses due to psychological factors, we will examine each of the three parts of the definition as they relate to us when we have those types of losses. Therefore, the second part of this book examines the mental processes, behavioral characteristics, and emotions of people who lose money in the markets. 1. Mental Processes Chapter 6 explains what happens when a market position, especially a loss, gets personalized. It presents the difference between external, objective losses and internal, subjective losses. Next, it looks at the mental process an individual goes through when experiencing an internal loss: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Most people equate loss with being wrong and, therefore, internalize what should be an external loss. Then they start to experience the Five Stages of Internal Loss, and the loss gets larger as they progress through the stages. Finally, the chapter makes a distinction between losses from discrete events (e.g., games) and continuous processes (e.g., markets) and shows that only the latter are subject to the Five Stages. 2. Behavioral Characteristics Chapter 7 discusses the most common way people personalize market positions. The chapter introduces the five types of participants in the markets:… ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1207))

Emotionalism, on the other hand, can and should be avoided. Emotionalism is decision making based on emotions. The entity that best describes emotional decision making is the crowd. The chapter explains that the crowd is the epitome of emotions in action and discusses the crowd not in the familiar terms of contrary opinion or as a stage of a runaway market but in terms of a process that can affect a solitary individual. Being a member of the crowd is not a function of quantity of people. Rather, it is a function… ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1226))

- Most people acknowledge that losses will happen regardless of the type of business venture. A light-bulb manufacturer knows that two out of three hundred bulbs will break. A fruit dealer knows that two out of one hundred apples will rot. Losses per se don’t bother them; unexpected losses and losing on balance does. Acknowledging that losses are part of business is one thing; taking and accepting those losses in the markets is something else entirely. In the markets, people tend to have difficulty actively (as opposed to passively, as in the case of the fruit dealer and bulb manufacturer) taking losses (i.e., accepting and controlling losses so that the business venture itself doesn’t become a loser). This is because all losses are treated as failure; in every other area of our lives, the word loss has negative connotations. People tend to regard the words loss, wrong, bad, and failure as the same, and win, right, good, and success as the same. For instance, we lose points for wrong answers on tests in school. Likewise, when we lose money in the market we think we must have been wrong. The American Heritage Dictionary defines lose as (1) to be deprived of through death and (2) to fail to win (i.e., to lose a game; to be defeated). Most of the time lose or loss is associated with games. Somehow, the concepts profit and loss get confused with win and lose and right and wrong. But if you lose as a participant of a game, you weren’t wrong; you were defeated. If you lose as a spectator of a game, you must have placed a bet (or expressed an opinion) on the game’s outcome and you lost money (or were wrong), but you were not defeated.

- EXTERNAL VS. INTERNAL LOSSES There are many different types of losses. You can lose your keys, a game or contest, money, your mind, esteem, self-control, your parents, a bet, a job, etc. However, all losses can be categorized either as (1) internal, such as self-control, esteem, love, your mind, or (2) external, such as a bet, a game or contest, money. External losses are objective, and internal losses are subjective. That is, an external loss is not open to subjective, individual interpretation; it is an objective fact. On the other hand, an internal loss is defined in terms of the individual (i.e., subject) experiencing it. In other words, a loss is objective when it is the same for me, you, and anyone else. The loss is subjective when it differs from one person to another, when it is entirely a personal experience. For instance, thousands of people die every day, but those deaths aren’t “losses” to everyone, only to those who are directly and personally (i.e., internally and emotionally) affected. This type of loss is an internal loss and is a function of, and created by, the feelings and reactions of the person experiencing them. This means the loss is subjective and definable only in terms of the individual experiencing it. On the other hand, when Kentucky loses a basketball game, it is no more of a loss for a member of the losing team than for a spectator in terms of it being an external, objective fact. Both people are totally outside the definition of the event itself. Anyone who was watching the game can tell you which team lost, and everyone watching would tell you the same thing. An objective loss is impervious to how you feel about it or react to it. It’s not subject to anyone’s appraisal; it must be accepted without evaluation. The player and spectator just mentioned could personalize this external loss if they equated their self-esteem with the success or failure of the team. This would internalize an external loss. Because people tend to regard loss, wrong, bad, and failure as the same thing, it is little wonder that loss is a dirty word in our vocabulary. However, in the markets losses should be viewed like the light bulbs or rotten fruit mentioned earlier: part of the business and taken with equanimity. Loss is not the same as wrong, and loss is not necessarily bad. For example, consider exiting a losing position with a small loss but before the loss got bigger. That was a loss, but it was a good decision. By the same token, a profitable trade based on a tip may be bad because of the dangers of following tips (i.e., the tipster may have incorrect information or he doesn’t tell you when to get out). Market losses are external, objective losses. It’s only when you internalize the loss that it becomes subjective. This involves your ego and causes you to view it in a negative way, as a failure, something that is wrong or bad. Since psychology deals with your ego, if you can eliminate ego from the decision-making process, you can… ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1267))

- The key to understanding how external losses become internalized lies in knowing the subtle differences between facts and opinions. The American Heritage Dictionary defines a fact as something that has been objectively verified. Facts are neither right nor wrong; they simply are. Opinions are personal assessments and are right or wrong depending on whether they actually correspond with the facts. Therefore, only opinions can be right or wrong; facts cannot. Right and wrong are inappropriate for the description of business operations and market participation, and so are the terms win and lose. Participating in markets is not about being right or wrong, nor is it about defeat; it’s about making decisions. Decision making is a process of reaching a conclusion after careful consideration; it is a judgment, a choice between alternatives when all the facts are not yet, and cannot yet, be known because they depend on events unfolding in the future. Therefore, decision making is not a choice between right and wrong. In 20/20 hindsight, decisions might be good or bad but not right or wrong. With regard to the markets, only expressed opinions can be right or wrong. Market positions are either profitable or unprofitable, period. But due to the vocabulary quirks outlined above, it is easy to equate losing money in the market with being wrong. In doing so, you take what had been a decision about money (external) and make it a matter of reputation and pride (internal). This is how your ego gets involved in the position. You begin to take the market personally, which takes the loss from being objective to being subjective. It is no longer a loss of money, but a personal loss to you (i.e., someone you knew was on the airplane that crashed). An example of personalizing market positions is people’s tendency to exit profitable positions and keep unprofitable positions. It’s as if profits and losses were a reflection of their intelligence or self-worth; if they take the loss it will make them feel stupid or wrong. They confuse net worth with self-worth. The very use of the terms right and wrong when describing a market position or business dealing means (1) an opinion has been expressed, which only a person can do; (2) the market position or business venture has been personalized; and (3) any losses (or successes) are going to be internalized.

- Ross. During interviews with 200 terminally ill patients, the author identified five stages terminally ill patients go through once they find out about their illness. One can see the same stages in most people facing personally tragic news, such as the death of a spouse or a child. I also think people experiencing any type of internal loss go through these stages. For the purposes of this book let’s refer to them as the Five Stages of Internal Loss. Below is a brief description of each stage and a reference to how I displayed the same characteristics when I was in the bean-oil trade. 1. Denial Upon receiving the news of being terminally ill, patients immediately responded, “No, not me. It can’t be true.” Some patients were observed “shopping around” for many doctors, looking for reassuring second opinions. Patients discounted doctors’ opinions that confirmed the original diagnosis and emphasized those that were more optimistic. This is the same thing I was doing in September and October of 1983 when the bean-oil position stopped going up and started down. I was losing money but denied that the market had really turned around. I was indignant. That was the trade that was going to make me $10 million, remember? In October I knew that I was under water but didn’t even know how far under I was. That is the personification of denial. If you can’t even, or don’t dare, sit down and calculate how much you’re losing in a position, but you know to the exact penny how much you’re making on your profitable positions, then you’re denying the loss. I also sought “second opinions” by asking other traders what they thought about the market. And, of course, I listened to the ones who were bullish and ignored those who weren’t. 2. Anger When the denial stage cannot be maintained any longer, it is replaced with feelings of anger (e.g., rage, envy, resentment). The anger is displaced in all directions (e.g., nurse, family, doctor, treatment) and projected onto the environment at random. I vented a lot of my frustrations about the loss in the form of anger directed mainly at my family. For a while, Pat and the kids avoided me like the plague. 3. Bargaining Unable to face facts in the first stage and angry at people and God in the second stage, patients try to succeed in entering some sort of agreement that may postpone the inevitable from happening: “If God has decided to take… ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1316))

- Once a person has personalized a market position and it starts to show a loss, he is uncertain when or how it is going to end (just like the person with the terminal illness is uncertain what’s coming next) and he goes through the Five Stages of Internal Loss. He denies it’s a loss. (“No way! Is the market really down there? Are you sure that’s not a misprint?”) It’s a profitable trade that just hasn’t gone his way yet. He gets angry at his broker or his spouse or the market. After that he starts bargaining with God or the market—that if he can only get back to breakeven, he will get out of the position. Then he gets depressed about the losing… ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1356))

- The market participant doesn’t have to move directly to the acceptance stage. He can loop back to denial after each and every temporary reprieve the market gives him. If the market rallies some, he thinks the market has finally turned. But when the market starts back down again, he slips back into denial, then anger, and so on. With each temporary rally he has another opportunity to play out the stages and lose more money in the process. Even if the position is a net profit, the trader or investor can go through the Five Stages. Consider when a market position is profitable but not as profitable as it once was. When that happens, he becomes married to the price at which it was the most profitable. He denies that the move is over, gets angry when the market starts to sell off, makes a bargain that he’ll get out if the market moves back to that arbitrary point, gets depressed that he didn’t get out, and maybe even lets the profit turn into a loss, thus slipping again into denial, then anger, etc. He creates a chain reaction of loops that result in further losses. This is exactly what I did in the bean-oil trade. Every time the market rallied, I felt relieved and assumed that the decline was over. Having survived each downdraft, I would start looking at the market as though I had just entered the position, and I would create new levels and parameters with which to monitor the market. DISCRETE EVENTS VS. CONTINUOUS PROCESSES Earlier in the chapter we saw that someone could actually internalize an external loss; the player or spectator could take the loss of the game as a personal matter and internalize what is properly an external loss. Although someone could do it, it’s a little hard to imagine someone going through the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance over a basketball game. Why? Because the game is a discrete event—an activity with a defined ending point. However, internalizing an external loss is a lot easier to do with the other type of loss-producing activity: a continuous process—an activity that has no clearly defined end. Losses from continuous processes are much more prone to become internalized because, like all internal losses, there is no predetermined ending point. In a continuous process, the participant gets to continuously make and remake decisions that can affect how much money he makes or loses. On the other… ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1362))

- nothing forces you to acknowledge it as a loss; there’s just you, your money, and the market as a silent thief. So as long as your money holds out, you can continue to kid yourself that the position is a winner that just hasn’t gone your way yet. The position may be losing money, but you tell yourself it’s not a loss because you haven’t closed the position yet. This is especially true for stock-market positions because when you own the stock outright, no margin call is going to force you to call a loss a loss. Think of the differences between discrete events and continuous processes this way: Would you lose more money or less money at the racetrack if they stopped the race in the middle and reopened the betting window? That is to say, if you had the opportunity to either (1) leave your bet or (2) make a second bet on another horse. You sat down before the race looked at the racing form and said, “Okay, number 4 is obviously the class horse, but he’s three to two and I’m not going to bet the favorite because there’s not enough payoff. I kind of like number 7, and he’s five to three, but 9 looks okay and he’s seven to one. I’ll go with 9.” Half way through the race who’s in front? Number 7. If they could stop the race and let you bet again, what would you do? You would say, “I knew it! I liked 7 to begin with. I should have picked 7.” You would go to the betting window and make a new bet on number 7. Who wins? Number 4. In the markets they never close the window. It’s open all the time, so you continuously get to remake that decision and constantly make new “bets.” When I was in Cleveland managing the office for Jack Salmon’s regional firm, I had an experience that demonstrates this concept of internalizing external losses. One time a lot of my customers got short the lumber market. They were big cash lumber hedgers and knew that market as well as anybody. Their analysis, and mine too, was that the market was overpriced and due for a fall. So we got short. Well, the market rallied sharply. The market opened limit up and stayed limit up for four days in a row. There was no trading in the futures so we couldn’t get out of our shorts. On the fifth day, the market started to trade but we didn’t get out. We wanted to watch the market to see if it would start back down. Well, it didn’t. After a few more days of the market trading during the day but closing limit… ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1388))

- Life is fraught with risk. Crossing the street is a risk, driving a car is a risk, getting married is a risk, and so is having children. Needless to say, starting and operating a business is a risk, and so is participating in the markets. Risk is defined as the possibility of suffering a loss. (It’s called probability only if you can assign a numerical value to the likelihood of the loss occurring.) In none of life’s activities is there a guarantee of success or of having things turn out the way you want. Obviously, the types of risk we are interested in are financial in nature, risk that produces monetary losses. Most people don’t know whether they are investing, speculating, or gambling, and to the untrained eye the activities are very similar. Looking back on my trip to Vegas I can see the similarity between the casino and the brokerage house. The brokers are the croupiers. The commissions are similar to the house percentage. The boardrooms are the casinos themselves. The stock exchange and the ticker tape are the gambling devices.1 However, the markets and gambling games are similar only in that they each involve the possibility of monetary loss. They are different not only in the legal sense but also in the economic sense. The big difference is: gambling creates risk while investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already exists. INHERENT RISK Inherent risk is a natural occurrence in both unorganized ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1469))

- markets and organized markets. Management guru Peter Drucker calls it “risk which is coincident with the commitment of present resources to future expectations.”2 Unorganized markets are the everyday markets in which we participate as consumers, such as the department store, the grocery store, and the gas station. The producers bear the financial risks associated with getting the product to the consumer. Organized markets, on the other hand, are the centralized exchanges and over-the-counter markets for stocks, bonds, currencies, options, and futures contracts. CREATED RISK Created risk involves the arbitrary invention of a potential monetary loss that otherwise would not have existed. Created risk is risk that is not a natural by-product of an activity itself. The roulette wheel could be spun, the football game played, and the horse race run without monetary loss occurring. Generally speaking, that’s as far as people distinguish between inherent and created risk. However, a closer examination reveals that what determines whether someone is engaging in created or inherent risk is not the activity itself but the characteristics the person exhibits when engaging in the activity.

- Let’s define what those five activities are and the characteristics associated with each.   1. Investing is parting with capital in the expectation of safety of principal and an adequate return on the capital in the form of dividends, interest, or rent. Since the return on capital takes the form of periodic payments of interest or dividends, investing indicates an intention to be separated from the capital for an extended period of time. Therefore, investing is usually associated with relatively long time horizon. Buying stocks in a pension fund with the intention of holding them indefinitely or buying bonds with the intention of holding until maturity is investing. 2. Trading is basically an activity in which someone (usually called a dealer) makes a market in a given financial instrument. Traders try to extract the bid-ask spread from a market. An example of a trader is the specialist on the floor of a stock exchange. He matches orders, maintains an orderly market and is willing to buy at the bid and sell at the offer. Traders on the futures and options exchanges make two-sided markets, trying to buy at the bid and sell at the offer. Traders in the over-the-counter stock and bond markets do the same thing. In its most basic definition, trading is market making. The trader essentially tries to stay net flat (neither long nor short) and makes money by extracting the bid-ask spread. In this sense, Stu Gimble, my friend from the lumber and Eurodollar pits, was the consummate mechanical trader. 3. Speculating in its simplest form is buying for resale rather than for use or income as is the case for commodities or financial instruments, respectively. Speculating is parting with capital in the expectation of capital appreciation. This capital appreciation is the sole extent of “return” for the speculator. He does not anticipate return in the form of periodic dividends or interest payments because he does not intend to hold the position for an extended period of time. The word speculation is derived from the Latin word specere, which means “to see.” Speculating means vision, perception, the faculty of intellectual examination. 4. Betting is an agreement between two parties where the party proved wrong about the outcome of an uncertain event will forfeit a stipulated thing or sum to the other party. Therefore, a bet is about being right or wrong. For example,… ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1490))

- playing a game; he is just playing. To a gambler, all normal criteria of odds (respective return, probability of winning, etc.) are irrelevant. At the poker table you always see some guy who stays in every hand, going for the inside straight even though the odds are he’s not going to hit it. In a best case situation, the odds are twelve to one against him and deteriorate from there if one of the cards he needs has already been played or is in another player’s hand. When I was in Las Vegas with Larry and Conrad, I saw gamblers at the roulette table just throwing money away. But they didn’t care; they were interested in entertainment and excitement, not money. It is important to understand that not all participants in gambling games are gamblers. The aim of the “professional gambler,” as he is called, is to make money. He can be recognized by deliberate and extremely disciplined wagering. His wagering is systematic and usually limited to infrequent but highly favorable opportunities. The behavior of the professional gambler is highly controlled and usually the result of a studied approach to his chosen game. He concentrates on games where the element of skill is sufficient to produce the possibility of a player advantage, such as blackjack and parimutuel betting. The professional gambler is similar to the stock arbitrageur in that they both take calculated risks. They are dealing with an uncertain outcome and seek to profit from their ability to anticipate the future or to see the future—in other words, to speculate. Professional gamblers are actually speculators because of the characteristics they exhibit when risking money. They are not seeking entertainment at the tables like gamblers do, and they are not trying to be right. They are trying to make money. Consider Edward O. Thorp, the author of Beat the Dealer and a mathematics professor who devised a winning card-counting system on a high-speed computer. He won so much money in Las Vegas playing blackjack that the Vegas Resort Hotel Association changed the rules of the game. Thorp wasn’t gambling, even though he was playing cards. He was a professional speculator.

A DANGEROUS COMBINATION As the epigraph to this chapter indicates, most people don’t know whether they are engaging in inherent- or created-risk activities. Couple this with people’s failure to distinguish between the two types of loss-producing events, continuous and discrete, introduced at the end of the last chapter, and you have a disaster waiting to happen. Recall that in discrete events, such as gambling and betting games, there is a defined end to the risk activity. But inherent-risk activities are continuous processes with no predetermined end. For instance, running a business keeps you continuously exposed to the risks coincident with the commitment of resources to future expectations. A single sales transaction may be a defined event with a beginning and an end, but the business operation itself is a continuous process. Likewise, a market position is a continuous process, which introduces the possibility of internal losses because of the uncertainty of when the process will end. On the other hand, created-risk activities are associated with discrete events, such as sports games, political contests, or the rolls of the dice; the game ends, the contest finishes, and the dice stop rolling. Betting and gambling are suitable for discrete events but not for continuous processes. If you introduce the behavioral characteristics of betting or gambling into a continuous process, you are leaving yourself open to enormous losses. In betting and gambling games, you wager and wait to see if you are right or to experience some excitement, respectively. Any resulting monetary losses are real, but they are also passive because the discrete event ends all by itself. On the other hand, a position in the market is a continuous process that doesn’t end until you make it end. If you “wager and wait” in the market, you can lose a lot of money. In betting and gambling games if you stop acting and do nothing, the losses will stop. But when investing, trading, or speculating, if you’re losing and stop acting, the losses don’t stop; they can continue to grow almost indefinitely. PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACIES We’ve already seen that everyday life involves risk. Likewise, estimating and managing those risks is a necessary part of everyday life. Probability is the mathematics of estimating risk, and you know how I feel about math. I’m not ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1559))

- going into a long dissertation on the subject. I am, however, going to point out some of the more common misunderstandings about probability and how we psychologically distort situations to make the odds seem more in our favor. In this section, I want to point out a few examples of the fallacies in popularly held beliefs about probability and how market participants apply the same fallacies to their market strategies and positions. Succumbing to the fallacies is harmful enough when applied to discrete events, but it is catastrophic when applied to continuous processes. Below are a few examples of the psychological fallacies most people have when it comes to risk and probability.4   1. The first psychological fallacy is the tendency to overvalue wagers involving a low probability of a high gain and to undervalue wagers involving a relatively high probability of low gain. The best examples are the favorites and the long shots at racetracks. 2. The second is a tendency to interpret the probability of successive independent events as additive rather than multiplicative. In other words, people view the chance of throwing a given number on a die to be twice as large with two throws as it is with a single throw—like throwing sixes four times in a row in craps and thinking that must mean their chances of throwing a seven next have improved. 3. The third is the belief that after a run of successes, a failure is mathematically inevitable, and vice versa. This is known as the Monte Carlo fallacy. A person can throw double sixes in craps ten times in a row and not violate any laws of probability because each of the throws is independent of all others. 4. Fourth is the perception that the psychological probability of the occurrence of an event exceeds the mathematical probability if the event is favorable and vice versa. For example, the probability of success of drawing the winning ticket in the lottery and the probability of being killed by lightning may both be one in 10,000, yet from a personal viewpoint, buying the winning lottery ticket is considered much more probable than getting hit by lightning. 5. Fifth is people’s tendency to overestimate the frequency of the occurrence of infrequent events and to underestimate that of comparatively frequent ones after observing a series of randomly generated events of different kinds with an interest in the frequency with which each kind of event occurs. Thus, they remember the “streaks” in a long series of wins and losses and tend to minimize the number of short-term runs. 6. Sixth is people’s tendency to confuse the occurrence of “unusual” events with the occurrence of low-probability events. For example, the remarkable feature of a bridge hand of thirteen spades is its apparent regularity, not its rarity (all hands are equally probable). As another example, if one holds a number close to the winning number in a lottery, he tends to feel that a terrible bad stroke of misfortune has caused him just to miss the… ([Location 1577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1577))

- amount of what I think I might make. But it doesn’t say anything about the probability of either event occurring. Some Dollars Are Bigger Than Others Why did the dollars seem so big at the blackjack table? Because I was accustomed to dealing with price ticks in the market, not tokens with $25 or $100 printed on them. Ordinarily, the use of chips is a psychological gimmick to minimize the importance of money, and it works on most people. But I was used to handling hundreds of thousands of dollars of market transactions on the simple shout of my voice, which made it seem like money wasn’t actually involved. When I had to physically take two twenty-five-dollar chips and throw them on the blackjack table, it felt like real money. Being down $2,000 in ticks in the market doesn’t feel the same as being down $2,000 at that baccarat table. It hurt a lot in baccarat. Also, the $7,000 in baccarat winnings felt like a lot more money than $7,000 in the market. Why? In the pit I was supposed to be working to try to make that kind of money, but in baccarat it was like free money. That means spending the $7,000 won in the casino was a lot easier than spending money made in the markets. The night after we’d won all the money, Conrad, Broderick, and I met a broker friend of Conrad’s who was trying to get some of Conrad’s business. We wanted to go to the best restaurant in town. The broker swore we wouldn’t be able to get a table on such short notice and without a reservation. Well, we went to the restaurant anyway and I slipped the maitre d’ hundred-dollar bills until he got us a table. It cost $600 but it was worth it to upstage the other broker. The money wasn’t important because we hadn’t worked for it. Those hundred-dollar bills were not nearly as big as the ones I had to work for in the pit. PROFIT MOTIVE OR PROPHET MOTIVE? There are two kinds of reward in the world: recognition and money. Are you in the market for recognition, congratulating yourself for calling every market move ahead of time and explaining the move after the fact, or are you in the market to make money? Are you more interested in the psychological reward of gold stars than the financial reward of gold coins? Are you trying to be right or to make money? Are you motivated by the prophet motive or the profit motive? To answer, you have to figure out which type of participant you are: bettor, gambler,… ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1618))

- One day in the summer of 1980, my partner Larry Broderick called me and said, “Hey, Jim, my stockbroker just called me with a tip, and we gotta buy this stock.” Some company I can’t even remember the name of (I told you I made investments that I couldn’t remember) was a rumored takeover candidate. The broker said the “talk” was if the takeover happens, it would probably be within sixty days and probably at $60 a share. At the time, the stock was at trading $25. So we checked to see if there were options on the stock. The 35 strike calls were trading way out of the money and with very little time premium. They were trading for 1/16 or 1/8. You could buy thousands of these things for very little money. Well, we liked buying thousands of anything, so we bought thousands of these call options. And I did exactly the same thing I would do later in the bean oil; almost everybody I knew had to have a couple of hundred of these options. Among all of our clients and acquaintances, we had tens of thousands of the 35 strike calls. I’d call my futures customers and say, “Look, I can’t sell you this stuff but trust me, go call your stockbroker and buy some.” Now, who’s not going to believe me when I tell them to buy something I can’t even sell them or make any money on? They believe! So, they bought the options. They all bought them. Everybody we knew bought them. Then the stock started to move, $25 … $26 … $27 … $28 … $29 …, and volume started picking up, too. Pretty soon the options started moving even though they were still trading for less than $1. When an option goes from 1/16 to 3/4, if you own 2,000 or 3,000 of them, you’re talking some serious money. I had control of 300,000 shares at $35. At the $60 takeover price that’s a $7,500,000 profit. Naturally, once something starts to work it’s real easy to get people to believe you. “Okay, I told you to buy these options two weeks ago when they were at 1/16. Now they are at 3/4. Do you want to get in or do you want to stay stupid?” If I knew you, you had to have at least of couple of hundred of these things just for health insurance. What do I mean by health insurance? If I tell you that something which costs 1/16 today might be worth $25 inside of one month, you have to buy some of it. It’s health insurance because once I tell you a story like that and you don’t buy some and it happens, you’re going to kill yourself… ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1661))

- dollar man. EMOTIONS AND THE CROWD Perhaps the most frequently cited reason for losses in the markets is emotion. These explanations run the gamut from simply citing greed and fear to others that go into great detail on emotions, their source from early childhood, and their effect on you. But examining individual emotions misses the point. Emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply are. They cannot be avoided. But emotionalism (i.e., decision making based on emotions) is bad, can be controlled, and should be avoided. So instead of examining each of the many individual emotions, this chapter will focus on the entity that epitomizes emotionalism: the crowd. Emotions are very strong feelings arising subjectively rather than through conscious mental effort. As will be shown shortly, the fundamental characteristic of a crowd is that it is exclusively guided by unconscious motives. In other words, it is guided by emotions. If you don’t have conscious control of your actions, then your emotions have control of you. Therefore, in order to understand how emotionalism adversely affects you as an investor, trader, or speculator, you have to know the characteristics and behaviors of the crowd.… ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MNMHBA0&location=1692))
