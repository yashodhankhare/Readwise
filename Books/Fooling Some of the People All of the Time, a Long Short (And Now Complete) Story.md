## Highlights
- Short selling is the opposite of owning, or being long, a stock. When you are long, the idea is to buy low and sell high. In a short sale, you still want to buy low and sell high, but in this case the sale comes before the purchase. It works this way: Your broker borrows shares from a shareholder who lends them to you, and you sell them in the market to a new buyer, thus establishing a short position. To close out the position at a later date, you buy shares in the market and return them to your broker to “cover” your short, and the broker returns them to the owner. Your profit or loss is the difference between the price you receive when you sell the shares short and the price you pay to buy them back. The more the stock falls, the more money you make—and vice versa. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=362))

- There were three basic questions to resolve: First, what are the true economics of the business? Second, how do the economics compare to the reported earnings? Third, how are the interests of the decision makers aligned with the investors? ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=452))

- Many value investors determine whether a security is cheap. If it is, they seek to determine whether it is cheap for a good reason. A typical process to identify opportunities is through computer screens that identify statistical cheapness, such as low multiples of earnings, sales, or book value combined with rising earnings estimates. Then, they evaluate the identified companies as possible investments. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=480))

- Greenlight takes the opposite approach. We start by asking why a security is likely to be misvalued in the market. Once we have a theory, we analyze the security to determine if it is, in fact, cheap or overvalued. In order to invest, we need to understand why the opportunity exists and believe we have a sizable analytical edge over the person on the other side of the trade. The market is an impersonal place. When we buy something, we generally do not know who is selling. It would be foolish to assume that our counterparty is uninformed or unsophisticated. In most circumstances, today’s seller has followed the situation longer and more closely than we have, has previously been a buyer, and has now changed his mind to become a seller. Even worse, the counterparty could be a company insider or an informed industry player working at a key supplier, customer or competitor. Some investors believe they have an advantage trafficking in stocks that have minimal Wall Street analyst coverage. We believe it doesn’t matter if a stock is “underfollowed” because the person we are buying from probably has followed the stock and we need to have a better grasp on the ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=484))

- Greenlight believes the traditional investment horizon is too short because equities are long, if not indefinite-duration, assets. When we make an investment, we usually don’t have any idea how long we will be invested. If the downside of an opportunity is no short-term return or “dead money,” we can live with that. We are happy to hold for more than a year before succeeding. In practice, some “dead money” opportunities work out more quickly than we expect. A portfolio where some investments work quickly, some work slowly, and the rest retain their value generates exciting results. The trick is to avoid losers. Losers are terrible because it takes a success to offset them just to get back to even. We strive to preserve capital on each investment. It does not always work out that way, but that is the goal.

- If our investment rationale proves false, we exit the position rather than create a new justification to hold. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=533))

- I decided to run a concentrated portfolio. As Joel Greenblatt pointed out in You Can Be a Stock Market Genius Even If You’re Not Too Smart: Uncover the Secret Hiding Places of Stock Market Profits, holding eight stocks eliminates 81 percent of the risk in owning just one stock, and holding thirty-two stocks eliminates 96 percent of the risk. Greenblatt concludes, “After purchasing six or eight stocks in different industries, the benefit of adding even more stocks to your portfolio in an effort to decrease risk is small.” This insight struck me as incredibly important.

- There are two types of bad outcomes. Sometimes, after analyzing the risk and reward, an investment appears attractive, but the unfortunate or unlikely happens. Such is life. Other times, the analysis is simply flawed: The investment is poor and we deserve the eventual loss. This mistake was the latter.

- spin-off is when a large company divests a subsidiary by distributing the subsidiary’s shares to the parent company’s shareholders. Over the years, we have found that carefully selected spin-offs are terrific opportunities. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=638))

- We decided not to accept additional money until we were prepared to invest it. Why? Adding too much new capital to a portfolio too quickly is a problem. It creates undue pressure to find new investments or to add to existing positions. We do not deploy new capital into existing positions unless they are either fresh ideas or positions to which we really want to add. However, while professional money managers habitually put new money into existing ideas, we don’t feel comfortable doing that when an investment is already in the middle innings. If we buy something at $10 thinking it is worth $20, do we really want to add to it at $16 if we think the value hasn’t changed? It is better to wait for a fresh opportunity or to close the fund to new investment. On the other hand, when the portfolio is fully invested, adding new assets helps investment performance. It allows room for new opportunities without selling existing positions prematurely. We have accepted new capital from time to time under those circumstances.

- Our goal is to make 20 percent per year. This will not happen each year, but we hope to average that over time with demonstrably less risk than the market. This is a challenging goal, which we may not achieve. I believe in setting high goals rather than easily clearable low ones. However, the strong initial result was no reason to raise the bar.

- Many times, the bulls win the battle on the core criticism (in this case, regulators didn’t immediately kill the company), but the bears win the war, as business or accounting reforms cause disappointing performance.

- Market extremes occur when it becomes too expensive in the short-term to hold for the long-term. John Maynard Keynes once said that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=894))

- Fraud can persist for a long time, and investors, analysts, and the SEC miss things. But, sooner or later, the truth wins. If you know you are right, all you need is patience, persistence, and discipline to stay the course. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004D4YO6A&location=987))
