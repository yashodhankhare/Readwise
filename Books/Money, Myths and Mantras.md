## Highlights
- What next, was the question. Till then, what I and First Global had been doing is called sell-side work. In investing/finance, the buy side consists of those who actually manage funds or assets—for example, those who run mutual funds or Portfolio Management Services (PMS). Sell side is industry jargon for broking, investment banking, etc., where you are ‘selling’ your services to fund managers or asset managers who are making the final decisions on investments. Sell-side participants are those who support asset managers with research, stockbroking services, etc. They also help companies raise money via public offerings, institutional placements and the like. Doing sell-side work, providing research to even the largest funds in the world, became a bit frustrating, as even after all your analysis and conviction, the fund manager may not take the decision you have advised for reasons of their own.

- As in India, we never held back from calling it the way we saw it—this included being the only firm on Wall Street to have a buy on Amazon in early 2001 at a price of $12 (split-adjusted $0.75) and calling out the scams in Enron and Worldcom much before they became public—all coming out of cold, objective analysis of the numbers and other facts available.

- While much has changed in this whole journey, including the business First Global does, certain parts of our DNA have remained the same. A sample of some of the things I’ve always told my team: Never use a formula whose derivation you do not know. Never use a model unless you can explain its limitations and assumptions. Nothing is sacrosanct or written in stone: not what I tell you, not what is written in a textbook, not what is said by the greatest investor or professor! Test everything against what is happening in the real markets and see what the data shows. Let the numbers emerge, whether it is company margins or macroeconomic predictions, rather than start with a view and torture the data to make it say what you want to say. All this and more lies ahead in the book you hold in your hands. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=368))

- Lesson 1: Asset allocation sahi hai Asset allocation is not just the best thing, it’s the only thing. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=394))

- Equity returns have low predictability, not just on a one- or two-year basis, but sometimes even over a longer time frame. For example, during the entire decade from 2010 to 2020, Indian equity markets compounded at just about 8.5 per cent when fixed deposit rates were also around 8 per cent. So you saw a lot of volatility, with practically no additional return for taking equity risk at all, for a whole decade. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=401))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Why does asset allocation work? Because different assets give disparate returns at various points in time. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=406))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But did you ever hear any fund manager or your financial adviser tell you that you were better off investing, or at least diversifying, into government paper and gold, instead of focusing on equities, if you wanted the best returns? I suspect not. The reason for this is simple: nobody in the business of fund management or financial advice makes much or any money by recommending investments in government securities or gold. The maximum fees are for recommending equity. All behaviour, good or bad, is always driven by incentives, and sellers of equities incentivize their salespeople far more than sellers of any other asset class, even if they do not deliver returns. That is part of the reason for this ‘100 per cent in equity if you are young’ recommendations you often see. Don’t ever forget this!

- Lesson 2: Take a portfolio approach to investing ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=416))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But even within your equity portfolio, be mindful of the weightage of each of your stocks and each sector. For every stock you buy, be absolutely clear about the allocation for that stock and how much it changes the weightage of its industry in your portfolio, and how it alters the risk profile of your equity pie. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=421))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Just making random stock purchases without a clear portfolio plan will lead you to a point of no return in your investing life. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=426))

- Falls and rises in the market are not symmetrical. A 50 per cent fall requires a 100 per cent rise in the portfolio value to come back to where you started out from. Therefore, always first concentrate on minimizing big losses (called drawdowns by professionals, to soften the blow) rather than maximizing returns. As human beings, we are not accustomed to making decisions that recognize pain or crystallize losses. We are happier taking pills to mask pain. Recognizing and booking a loss becomes an ego game: ‘How could I be wrong?’ The loss-aversion bias is hard-coded ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=435))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- coded into our psyche. It does not help that we are conditioned to be pained by losses and to avoid them. This translates into unwillingness to accept a mistake. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=439))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In reality, it is always better to ruthlessly accept a loss and look for better places to deploy the remaining capital. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=444))

- Lesson 4: Diversify globally if you want to avoid SCCARS SCCARS stands for single country, single currency, single asset risks. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=447))

- In India itself, the ten-year data for returns from the Indian stock market from 2010 to 2020 in dollar terms was a shocker: it was negative 3 per cent. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=456))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There has been a depreciation of over 85 per cent in the value of the Indian rupee over the course of less than a full career. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=458))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What it means is that the average Indian’s wealth was eroding in US dollar terms for a whole decade. India was an underperformer almost every year relative to most other global markets. Therefore, contrary to what is constantly told to you, India was a very poor-performing market for several years compared with its global peers. Of course, that has changed since . . . because, as I’ve said elsewhere, no theme runs forever. If you strip investing of all its jargon, it is a pretty simple game: avoid big losses, stay with the winners and diversify investments across asset classes, sectors and markets. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=459))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Let me give you another statistic: when I started my career in the 1980s, the US dollar was worth Rs 12. In 2023, as I write this, it is around Rs 83. So there has been a depreciation of over 85 per cent in the value of the Indian rupee over the course of less than a full career. This is what you have to also take into account when you are planning for your long-term goals, including your retirement. You have to ensure that your hard-earned money retains its value, and global diversification is a key means to this. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=465))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The basic framework Make a deliberate decision on asset allocation for your total investments (split among equity, fixed income, gold, real estate, etc.) depending on your age, goals and requirements. Also make provision for the unexpected. In the equity portfolio, avoid concentration in only two or three industries. Risk management is paramount. In order to win, you have to avoid the big losses. Global diversification is a must for your long-term financial health. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=470))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Depending on the study you read (and there have been many, conducted over the decades), you will find that as much as 85 to 92 per cent of the returns of a portfolio come from asset allocation! ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=490))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Moral of the story: it does not make sense to concentrate your resources and time on security or stock selection. Especially since you probably have a day job and are not spending 100 per cent of your working hours on investing. But all the talk you will hear from portfolio managers will be about how good they are at picking stocks and great bottom-up winners. The uncomfortable point is: bottom-up stock picking is an extremely difficult art, and nobody in the history of investing has been able to do it successfully for decades. Yes, not even Warren Buffett. Just look at his record of the past fifteen or twenty years and you will see an investor who has under-performed to just about market-performed versus the S&P 500. Even worse, the volatility of Berkshire Hathway returns has been more than that of the index. Contrary to popular opinion, Buffett’s strategy has not worked—either for risk management or higher returns, even when we take a period as long as two decades. Plus, he missed practically every single multibagger that the US market has given in this period: Amazon, Domino’s, Google, Apple (he bought the stock way too late), Microsoft, etc., and now may be making the reverse mistake by having nearly half of his portfolio in Apple. More on that in a later chapter. The point? This is PRECISELY the problem with the ‘sexy’, bottom-up stock-picking approach. Everybody is relevant during a particular period of time. And one fine day, the market changes and one’s picks don’t do so well any more. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=495))

- Recency bias always misleads. We extrapolate what has happened in the recent past and expect it to continue, but that isn’t how markets, or life, work. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=513))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Indians, in fact, are about the worst in the world in terms of home country bias, with something like 97–98 per cent of our investments being in India. This has partly to do with historical reasons, as Indian residents could not invest abroad in the past due to capital controls. Even though the limits are now generous under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the RBI, the earlier mindset of investing only in India still remains. Just because you happen to be born in a country does not mean that your portfolio must be skewed towards that country. There is no logic in this. Yet most of us have a disproportionate amount of our investments in our home country, causing what I call SCCARs—single country single currency single asset risk—which can hit your portfolio hard, especially when there is a crisis. In theory you should be underweight on your home country in the equities market, simply because in all other areas of your life—career, real estate, etc.—you are already overexposed to the country. But even if you don’t go there, you should build up a global exposure of at least 30–40 per cent of your portfolio. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=520))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Ideally, you want an asset manager who can dynamically and tactically change asset allocations as market conditions change. Even if this is not always possible and you continue with a fixed allocation, it is better to be diversified across asset classes and countries. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=532))

- The mantra: There is always a bull market somewhere in the world, even as there is a bear market elsewhere at the same time! ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=537))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In fact, some of the investment documents we have seen even cite the same studies that I have mentioned in another chapter which prove that 85 per cent to 92 per cent of the returns in a portfolio come from asset allocation, with specific stock selection contributing only 8 per cent to 15 per cent of returns.6 ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=575))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For the asset allocation strategy to really work in your favour, your consideration set must include all assets: Developed market equities, emerging market equities, developed market fixed income, gold and precious metals, other commodities, real estate or real estate-based instruments across countries, and so on. Just changing the investment allocation across different categories in the Indian equity market, or even the Indian equity and debt markets, is simply not good enough! That is like playing football on 20 per cent of the football field—which is better than not playing at all, but can it be really called football? ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=579))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When I talk of asset allocation, it means that your consideration set has practically all the investible asset classes in the world. The other key is to have a dynamic and tactical asset allocation model—i.e., assets are to be reallocated based on the tactical view of various asset classes at any point in time. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=588))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- An in-depth understanding of the underlying asset classes is also important. Among other things, this is to ensure that the asset classes are really largely uncorrelated. This understanding comes from studying data and from long experience. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=597))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is your financial adviser or money manager well versed across asset classes, across countries, across currencies? If not, you need to be very careful, because you may be getting trapped by the narrow expertise of your money manager, which is fine for her or him, but can be disastrous for your portfolio. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=601))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The key takeaway for the time being is that you cannot afford to ignore global assets when deciding on your asset allocation. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=607))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- True asset allocation Asset allocation cannot just consider two or three types of assets in a single country, the way many Indian mutual fund and PMS schemes are set up. The consideration set must feature all asset classes AND all geographies/countries. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=615))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Ideally, there should be dynamic and tactical reallocation. Meaning, the region and asset mix should be changed from time to time. Investments should not be done for entertainment. Asset allocation is right for your portfolio, even when it is boring and unsexy. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=617))

- It is the old adage of not putting all your eggs in one basket. It is as simple as that. Or what we call exposing your portfolio to SCCARs (Single Country Single Currency Single Asset Risks). ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=723))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is also important to remember that no matter how stable a business appears to you, the stock of that company can never be an evergreen stock. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=809))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For example, if someone tells you that a particular company has great brands, here are the questions you should ask: Where exactly does this brand strength show up? ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=865))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is the company able to get more market share? Do its volumes not decline when every other industry player’s volumes do? Is it able to charge higher prices than the competition for similar products, i.e., does it have greater pricing power than them? Does it have higher margins than them? A combination of the above? ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=866))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Plus, once you start to do this exercise, it also tells you what you don’t know about the company, so that’s a very good discipline. And when you get your hands dirty making the estimates you realize some things that appear very counterintuitive. For example, if in a cyclical industry there’s going to be an upturn, very often you will find that the worst company in the industry gives you the biggest bang for the buck rather than the already well-run company. More on this phenomenon elsewhere. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=950))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Nearly every analyst estimate for 95 per cent, if not more, of companies, assumes that profits grow every year—a feat that has been achieved by only seventeen out of the roughly 4000 listed companies in India over even ten years. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=955))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Before we go answer these questions, let us first define what P/E, or PE, is. It is the ratio of the market price of the stock to earnings per share (EPS). ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=979))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is the same thing as the market capitalization of the stock divided by the net income or profit after tax. The market capitalization of a stock is the market price of the share multiplied by the number of equity shares issued by the company. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=981))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This much is clear—if a company’s earnings are growing faster, you will need to pay a higher price for its stock. At this stage, if I ask the candidate to define other factors that would cause the PE to change, in nine cases out of ten the answers become a little vague—subjective factors like brand name, management quality, etc., are sometimes talked about. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=988))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But this also gives only part of the picture, because it leaves out an important factor, which is the investment required to achieve this growth. For example, if two companies in the same industry have similar earnings and growth prospects but one has an annual capital expenditure (capex) requirement that is significantly higher than the other, the two would, and should, be valued differently. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1003))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is intuitively obvious that Company 1 should be valued higher than Company 2, even though both have exactly the same income stream or net profit. In fact, higher growth may result in depletion of investor/shareholder wealth if the earnings from the incremental investment do not cover the marginal cost of capital. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1007))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The technical way of saying this is that if a company that does not earn enough return on capital—that is, its incremental return on equity is lower than its cost of equity—it will only destroy value the faster it grows. It may sound strange, but growth in profits may reduce the value of a company. Your friend from a business community would intuitively understand this: Vyaj to chhootna chahiye, she or he will say—i.e. your business investment should… ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1010))

- This phenomenon of not earning the cost of capital was true of many infrastructure companies in India around 2010. These companies were greatly in favour at that time in the market, and the story was: ‘If India has to progress it has to invest in infrastructure. Infrastructure companies are a no-brainer.’ However, when I looked at the cold numbers, I realized that the return on equity for most of these companies had declined substantially—by between 26… ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1016))

- Think of it this way: If you set up a business investing Rs 1 crore, and then earn a net profit of Rs 15 lakh in a year, the RoE for that business in that year is 15/100, i.e., 15 per cent. Suppose that business earns only Rs 7 lakh, the RoE will be 7 per cent. The business will not look attractive if you can get 8 per cent from bank fixed deposits, which don’t even carry significant risk. This level of profit may be acceptable at the initial stages of a business or during a bad phase in the business cycle. But if this is going to be its steady-state earnings, then that business is not worth doing. When you invest in a business, since that carries some risk, you need to beat not just the fixed deposit or risk-free interest rates, but also be compensated for the risk. Therefore, the business is not worth doing unless you beat the cost of equity… ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1025))

- Cost of equity is an important driver of the P/E multiple The other factor which would influence the valuation of a stock is the cost of equity capital for the company, implicit in which is a return expectation. This, in turn, is influenced by the perception of risk in the company’s earnings (this takes into account a whole gamut of factors, from industry cyclicality to management quality to leverage). The textbook way to factor in all these variables into your valuation model is to actually project cash flows for the company and… ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1037))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With additional growth, the value of the company actually declines, from Rs 300 crore to Rs 276 crore! A company’s return on capital may be lower than its cost of capital or its return on equity may be lower than its cost of equity. If this ratio were to remain unchanged indefinitely, the stock would have a negative value as incremental growth would deplete shareholder value. In fact, you would not want to buy the stock at any price unless you could foresee an improvement in returns! ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1051))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you earn only your cost of capital, growth is irrelevant In the trivial case when the return on equity capital equals its cost, the growth rate becomes irrelevant for valuation as the P/E reduces to 1/r. This is because the company is not adding any economic value by growing. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1059))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What about interest rates? The cost of equity in the equation above is determined by the interest rates prevailing in the economy which determine the risk-free rate as well as the risk premium. There is a separate chapter on how interest rates influence equity prices. Is this whole exercise only a theoretical one? Of course, it is. But it still serves a purpose. You may think that what we’ve discussed is a purely theoretical formula—after all, who can estimate what the return on net worth or growth in earnings for a company will be ten years hence. The point is that, like it or not, you are in any case implicitly making all these assumptions every time you put a multiple on current earnings, because you are valuing the company as a going concern. Basically, the beauty of the formula discussed here is that it forces you to deliberately think about and question your assumptions. It is not magic. It is not even exact, but it does give you a range of possible multiples, given various scenarios. It is, therefore, infinitely better than theorizing about what P/E multiple a stock should get, without really knowing why.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And also for explaining why ‘buy at any price’ does not work. What drives the P/E ratio The price-earnings ratio, or P/E, is the metric used most often to value a stock. P/E = stock price/earnings per share (EPS) = market capitalization of the stock/net profits. Most people are not really clear why different P/Es should be paid for the same rupee or dollar of earnings, and only give subjective reasons for the differences. Three factors determine the P/E - The higher the expected earnings growth rate, the higher the P/E - The higher the return on incremental capital or net worth, the higher the P/E - The higher the cost of equity (risk-free interest rate + equity risk premium), the lower the P/E The real use of calculating the P/E this way is not to do an exact exercise but to see what assumptions are embedded into the price and whether they appear justified.

- Growth-adjusted P/E (P/E/CAGR of EPS) The most popular variation of the P/E ratio is the growth-adjusted P/E, also at times called the Lynch ratio, after Peter Lynch, who popularized it. It is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. However, conceptually it appears to be flawed. The intention behind the concept is to find a stock that has a low P/E relative to its growth rate. Let’s think about this—what kind of company would exhibit this characteristic? ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1089))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The logical answer is—a company that increases earnings growth, which in turn is usually through increases in capital employed. Unless the company management is able to keep the operating profit margin (OPM) leverage and asset turnover up (when capital employed increases sharply, there is every chance that asset turnover, at least, will decline), and return on capital employed declines in tandem with these figures declining. And, as we saw in the previous chapters, the return ratios need to be high for the market to value the stock highly. History is replete with examples of companies of this kind, from HDFC in the 1990s to infrastructure companies around 2009-10 to companies that raised a lot of capital during the IPO (initial public offer)/QIP (qualified institutional placement) boom window.

- In the last case, since the money is raised at a premium, EPS growth remains robust but return ratios get diluted. And the Lynch ratio leads you precisely to such companies—companies that grow earnings usually at the cost of returns, and therefore (deserve to) trade at lower multiples. These are the very companies you want to avoid! ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1102))

- This tool is also very useful for analysing commodity companies. If one has to value commodities on straight P/Es, then one can get caught at the wrong end of the cycle. Hence, growth-adjusted EPS, which captures the weighted average EPS for the entire cycle, becomes a very useful tool when looked at relative to price. Similar calculations can be done for growth-adjusted P/CEPS and EV/EBITDA. Parsing out the P/E further Many try to relate P/E ratios to earnings growth by simply dividing the P/E ratio by earnings growth and calling the result as growth-adjusted P/E. However, this suffers from the serious issue of earnings growth could possibly have been ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=1129))

- achieved by deploying additional capital, either via debt or by raising equity at a premium, which dilutes return ratios even as P/E grows. On the other hand, a high-RoE company may also be overpriced and hence not give good returns. There is a weighted average variation to the growth-adjusted P/E, which gives a higher weight to near-term earnings and also enables one to consider a complete cycle for commodity and other cyclical industries.

We have done this exercise several times in the last few decades and the results have been the same every time. Every time, only fifteen to twenty-five companies manage to show earnings growth every year for even a ten-to-fifteen-year period.

- Leading on from this, I reckoned a four-to-five-year cash flow forecast should be a reasonable way to go. So I designed the process thus: This OPCF is calculated for each of the four or five years and discounted back to the present day at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and liquid assets added to give the discounted operating cash stream (DOCS). This value is then compared with the firm value calculated on a DCF basis. This ratio indicates what operating cash flows in, say, the next four years available to equity holders contribute to the total equity ‘fair value’. This ratio can then be converted into the proportion of market price that accrues to equity holders as operating cash flows during the next four years. An example makes this clearer.

- For a company, the ROE, which is net profit divided by average net worth, can be broken up into a product of: Net profit divided by sales or revenue, which we know as the net profit margin. Sales or revenues divided by assets, which captures how much revenues the company is generating on its. That is what is called the asset turnover. Assets divided by shareholder funds. As assets in a balance-sheet sense are the same as the capital employed by a business, in this ratio you have debt + equity (net worth) in the numerator, and you have only equity in the denominator.

- For example, if you are the management of Tesla and you decide to make a majority of the components of your car in-house, what does that mean? You have to set up extra facilities in terms of a new factory or add more machines—basically, you have to invest more in assets, which brings down the second factor, which is the asset turnover. But if you are doing more activities and value-addition in-house, your margins should go up as you are capturing within the company the margin that would have otherwise been made by an independent components manufacturer. In short, Tesla is investing more in land, plant and machinery to make the components so that it can make higher margins on an ongoing basis. Therefore, all other things being equal, Tesla’s profit margin should go up even as its asset turnover goes down. If I go back several decades, when Gujarat Ambuja Cement set up its first cement plant, it did many things that were a first for the Indian cement industry. The company management decided that they’d have their power plant in-house, they’d have a railway siding in-house, and also port facilities in order to use the ship route to transport cement to markets like Mumbai. Now, all of that meant a larger investment in fixed assets, but they were capturing more value, so that meant that their margins went up and their asset turnover went down.

- Even if the ROE of two companies in the same industry is similar but there is a significant difference in this last factor, which is leverage, you, as an investor, should not be neutral between the two. That means one company’s ROE has been enhanced as it has taken higher leverage—meaning, the company has taken proportionately higher debt. And higher debt usually means taking on higher risk, which is something all of us understand. If one company has a leverage (debt-equity ratio) of 2:1, this last factor will be 3. If the other company has a leverage of only 1:1, this last factor will be 2. In a sense, taking on higher debt or financial leverage is not an ideal way to improve ROE. This is not to say that all companies should have zero debt. But debt does increase the riskiness of a business, and therefore a company should only take on debt that it can service comfortably, even during a downturn in the business.

- All else being equal, if the final return on equity is the same for two companies, a rational investor will prefer a company that has got there with lower leverage or debt rather than one that has got there with higher leverage. Of course, we are talking about companies within the same industry, because leverage can vary widely between industries. To summarize this chapter . . . it is important to look at the ROE of a company rather than only margins or profitability, as it is possible for a company to improve margins by investing more in fixed assets. Therefore, higher margins do not necessarily mean better management or greater efficiency. Plus while taking on debt or increasing financial leverage does boost ROE, it also increases the riskiness of a business and hence, all analysis has to take both aspects into account.

- ‘low multiple as value’ definition, and in the last editions of his book, The Intelligent Investor, had written that intangible assets were becoming more important and had to be incorporated into the value equation. He meant that the traditional way of looking at the stock price as a multiple of its book value no longer held. This is what he wrote: It may be pointed out that under modern conditions the so-called ‘intangibles, e.g. good-will or even a highly efficient organization, are every bit as real from a dollars-and-cents standpoint as are buildings and machinery’. Earnings based on these intangibles may be even less vulnerable to competition than those which require only a cash investment in productive facilities. Furthermore, when conditions are favorable the enterprise with the relatively small capital investment is likely to show a more rapid rate of growth . . . We do not think, therefore, that any rules may reasonably be laid down on the subject of book value in relation to market price, except the strong recommendation already made that the purchaser know what he is doing on this score and be satisfied in his own mind that he is acting sensibly.12 Think about how much truer this statement must be now, nearly five decades later, when we have moved on even more to intellectual capital than physical capital.

This ratio tries to capture what you are earning in terms of profits—or the rate of return in a crude sense, when you invest in a business—which is what you do when you buy a stock. Think of it this way: if you are running a small business where you invest Rs 5 lakh and earn a profit of Rs 75,000 in a year, your E/P, or earnings yield, is 75,000 divided by Rs 5 lakh, which is 15 per cent.

If you’re buying a stock at Rs 60, don’t decide that you will sell it when it quotes at Rs 100 or Rs 150 or Rs 200, because that way you will miss out on the multibaggers. When you are buying a portfolio of twenty, twenty-five or thirty stocks, you don’t know which of them are going to be multibaggers—which are those that will go ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=2155))

- up several times. You do hope and expect that maybe one, maybe two, maybe three of them might be multibaggers. But you do not know in advance which of the stocks are going to be in that category. So let your profits run. As an aside, what most investors do is the opposite of this strategy—meaning, they let their losses run, at times waiting for their cost price to come back, whereas they book profits on their winners. This is the exact opposite of what you should be doing, as I have said. The reason we don’t do that is because very painful for human beings to book losses. It is called loss-aversion bias and is the cause of losses and underperformance in many portfolios. ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=2159))

- The exception to this rule is when a stock becomes an outsized part of your portfolio. If a single stock becomes 40–50–70 per cent of your portfolio because it has gone up multiple times, then you might want to trim it and book some profits just so that you don’t have such an outsized exposure to a single stock. The other exception would be in the case of small-cap stocks, where stop losses do not work well as when some of these stocks fall, they go down so fast that you are unable to exit. There, to err on the side of caution, you may book part profits even when the stock is going up. These are simple rules but will help you improve your portfolio management returns tremendously if you keep to the discipline.

- How does this translate into investment wisdom? When you take very few bets—meaning, invest in very few securities—you are essentially banking on luck, which may even help you get returns for a certain period of time. But you need to understand that this is still luck, not skill. If you really think you have the skill to pick the right stocks, then it can be mathematically proven (see the chapter on diversification) that the only way to ensure that your results reflect your skills is to take a large number of bets—that is, have a large number of stocks in your basket. With only twelve to fifteen stocks, the results will not reflect your skill level—whether it is good or bad. ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=2233))

- actual returns are closer to the expected value of the returns, or that the results are close to what you can expect given your skill levels. Let me explain. This might sound complicated, but it is actually quite simple. Think of this: you know a coin is expected to have a 50 per cent probability of heads or tails when tossed. Nevertheless, if you toss it only ten times it may happen that you might get only two heads, or you might get eight or nine heads. Basically, the predictability is not very high when it comes to a small number of tosses. However, if you toss it 100 times, it is going to be closer to that 50/50 number. Now, investing is a game of skill and luck. Diversification increases the component of skill and reduces the element of luck. Suppose you are skilful enough to pick the right stocks 65 per cent of the time. Why only 65 per cent of the time? Because no fund manager or investor in the world is ever right 80–90 or 100 per cent of the time—forget about that. So, even if you get your picks 60 per cent right, actually it is pretty good.

- With only a few stocks you are playing luck mainly Of course, with fewer stocks, what happens is that the element of chance coming into play increases. So if you are buying only twelve or fifteen stocks, there is a great element of chance that comes to play—and at times it may even favour you—so there might be one or two years when that kind of strategy does very well. Nevertheless, diversification increases predictability and makes the results more foreseeable as they will be closer to reflecting your skill level. In summary, diversification works only if you have the skill. Only if your system is designed such that it gives you outperformance will it ensure that in the real world too you have outperformance. It is that simple! ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=2496))

- maximum hits, and plans were afoot to reinforce these parts. That was when mathematician and statistician Abraham Wald pointed out that this analysis could be totally off, because it did not take into account the aircraft that did not return to base. The parts which showed no hits were probably the parts where, if the aircraft took a hit, it would not survive and be able to return to base. The bullet holes in the returning aircraft, contrary to conventional thinking, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still fly well enough to return safely to base. So Wald proposed that the navy reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, inferring that planes hit in those areas were lost. It was a brilliant piece of analysis that totally inverted the conventional way of looking at a problem.

As we repeat our story, we get more and more convinced about it. We become invested in not just the stock, which is the subject of our story, but also in our story about the stock.

- This was a moment of epiphany for him and showed him the fallacy of attributing success to his personal qualities and efforts when luck or destiny had played a crucial role too.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This self-attribution is not symmetrical in nature. It is not as if we attribute our success and failures equally to ourselves. Our tendency is to attribute our successes to our personal skills and failures to factors beyond our control. This, in fact, is the classical definition of self-attribution bias. Most of us can think of things that we’ve done and determined where, when everything is going according to plan, it’s clearly due to our skill. Then, when things don’t go according to plan, then just as obviously we had bad luck or some outside agency or person conspired against us. If we ace an exam, it is because of our intelligence, talent and hard work. But if we don’t do well in it, it is because the rating was unfair, or the professor did not teach the course properly. When we are selected for a job, we believe that we have been hired for our achievements, qualifications and excellent interview skills. But if we aren’t hired, it is because the interviewer was prejudiced or there was some other hanky-panky afoot. That is how the human mind works. In investing, self-attribution shows up like this: If I pick a stock and that does well, it’s because I’m a genius. But if the stock doesn’t do well, then it’s because of external factors—the economy, central bankers, politicians, company management, stock operators, and so on. In short, there are plenty of factors that can be blamed for my failure. Almost always, success is because of my skill. Failure is because of some risk that could not be foreseen.

Thus, a decision or rather an outcome going wrong is not necessarily a mistake. As they say in software, it is a feature, not a bug! Hence, the very definition of a mistake changes when you realize this. It completely inverts the lens from the outcome to the process.

Because at a time of crisis the concern is not about individual stock movements but the direction of the market as a whole.

- At times, it may be laziness at work, with the mind looking for shortcuts, and at other times a careful ‘economical with the truth’ decision, even on your own part. ‘Something that’s true but incomplete might be more dangerous than something that’s wrong, as a little truth is a fuel for a lot of overconfidence,’ said Morgan Housel.

- The key insight Here’s the key insight: Averaging INDEPENDENT estimates improves estimates or forecast accuracy. If, for instance, hundreds of people estimate, essentially guess, the number of marbles in a jar, the average is often remarkably close to the actual number, even if individual estimates are way off. The results are similar when you try to estimate or predict more nuanced stuff, like company profits. Why is this so? Because aggregation of independent responses reduces noise, or random variation. But this holds if and only if the estimates are made independently. ([Location 3433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3433))

- To engage in group discussions for your investment decisions is not just a waste of time, it is actually likely to lead you off track and you will end up worse off in terms of decision-making. This is risky. Without your being consciously aware of it your mind has been hijacked by group dynamics. Paradoxically, you will likely have more confidence in this decision reached by the group after discussions than in your own initial hypothesis, whether both are the same or diametrically opposite. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the sanctity and independence of your analysis and not get into an exchange of ideas, which, counterintuitively, will diminish the quality of decisions.

- Although this is an old quote, I came across it only recently and it set me thinking of how much we take for granted as background in our lives, which, when seen with fresh eyes, looks very different. As we know, something that is too close can be as out of focus as something that is too far from us. The fish is the last one to know what water is! For example, when somebody from the West came to India or a developing country for the first time, especially in the days before the world was so connected, they would be surprised that pavement dwellers, beggars or kids selling things at the traffic lights appeared invisible to the privileged local citizens. It was something they spent little or no conscious thought on. ([Location 3502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3502))

- In a running company (not a start-up), there is rarely if ever any discussion as to WHETHER there will be growth in earnings and cash flows.

- This is what you will find: nearly 100 per cent of earnings or discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models assume perpetual growth. It is assumed that companies will show earnings and cash flow growth in the next five years. That is the way the explicit-period cash flows are calculated. Then the terminal value calculation assumes that the cash flows will keep growing in perpetuity. ([Location 3523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3523))

- In short, instead of evaluating whether the machine works better than the human being, we expect the machine system to be perfect. This is completely irrational, as the rational thing to do is to test whether the machine system is an improvement on the alternative or the existing system rather than whether it is completely error free on a standalone basis. This type of thinking leads to wrong choices, as we may abandon an algo/machine even if it does better than what was being done earlier.

- can never get the right answer! If your question is whether switching to an artificial intelligence system will eliminate mistakes, then if the answer is no, will you not use that system?

- The edge that the securities industry or fund managers had in getting information from companies has been regulated away across the world—information availability has been made largely uniform. Hand on heart, I would say that it was the most fun part of my job as an equity researcher! However, the finest output is not about what is most fun for you individually but about what works the best . . . in this case, what results in an optimized portfolio. Information arbitrage is gone!

- In fact, now the problem is something quite different, which is that there is an absolute surfeit of data which is humanly unmanageable. And this is where the machines come in . . . There are mathematical models that dispense insights at speeds unimaginable in the past. They can analyse more securities AND more data points in each of those securities than is possible even for large teams of humans. To handle tonnes of data, you need advanced computing power for extreme data-crunching prowess. Most important, they can do this consistently and without bias—something that is impossible for human beings to do. Machines do the thinking for you. Machines ‘learn’ quicker and better than humans ever can. ([Location 3747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3747))

- Then why do we need humans? Since machines work so well, it begs the question: Do we need humans at all in the whole process, along with the machines? First, let me tell you an anecdote. Most of you would have heard of the time when the IBM supercomputer—the Deep Blue—was pitted against the then chess world champion Gary Kasparov in the 1990s. In that match, the computer won. This was sensational news at the time. ([Location 3816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3816))

- The human+machine system worked better than the best human, and it worked better than the best machine. What most people don’t know is that in 2005 the same experiment was repeated, with the supercomputer playing against not the world champion but against reasonably good chess players armed with laptops. And who won? The chess players with the laptops. Therefore, in the investment management context too, you need human beings with those decades of market experience in order to code the machine correctly. Which is why when only techies do it, it usually doesn’t work because they rely solely on machines. ([Location 3820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3820))

- Essentially, for any artificial intelligence and machine learning system to make sense, the factors fed into it must be logical. There are many areas where coding human market expertise is required. Only then will the output of the machine make sense. You need an overlay of human expertise once again. Because the machine relies on past data, there could be some things not captured by it. ([Location 3831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DT4MBWTW&location=3831))
