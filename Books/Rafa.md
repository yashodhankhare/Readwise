## Highlights
- Because what I battle hardest to do in a tennis match is to quiet the voices in my head, to shut everything out of my mind but the contest itself and concentrate every atom of my being on the point I am playing. If I made a mistake on a previous point, forget it; should a thought of victory suggest itself, crush it. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=55))
- And of one thing I have no doubt: the more you train, the better your feeling. Tennis is, more than most sports, a sport of the mind; it is the player who has those good sensations on the most days, who manages to isolate himself best from his fears and from the ups and downs in morale a match inevitably brings, who ends up being world number one. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=129))
- You get these blessed freaks of nature in other sports, too. The rest of us just have to learn to live with pain, and long breaks from the game, because a foot, a shoulder, or a leg has sent a cry for help to the brain, asking it to stop. That’s why I need to have so much bandaging done before a match; that’s why it’s such a critical part of my preparations.

- or going for a winner when it’s not time. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=212))
- as I did at the injustice and abuse he heaped on me, maybe I would not be the player I am today. He always stressed the importance of endurance. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=452))
- “Endure, put up with whatever comes your way, learn to overcome weakness and pain, push yourself to breaking point but never cave in. If you don’t learn that lesson, you’ll never succeed as an elite athlete”: that was what he taught me. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=453))
- You put that failure immediately behind you, clean out of your mind. You do not allow your mind to dwell on it. You draw, instead, on the strength of having won the first point and build on that, thinking only of what comes next. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=635))
- “Because it’s all in the head, in your attitude, in wanting more, in enduring more than your rival.” ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=664))
- I played through the pain to the point that I almost forgot about it. It’s a question of concentration, of putting everything out of your mind beyond the game itself. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=841))
- He set a benchmark of endurance that has served me as an example and as a reminder ever since that you can put mind over matter, and if you ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=844))
- want something badly enough, no sacrifice is too great. The measure ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=845))
- I was so exhausted at the end of the day that I slept well. The other saving grace was that I went home for weekends and that, yes, I got the qualifications I needed to bring my schooling to a satisfactory end. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=915))
- You have to remember that often in tennis you win by only the finest of margins, that there is an element of mathematical unfairness built into the game. It’s not like basketball, where the winner is always the one who has accumulated the most points. In tennis, the outcome often turns less on being the better player overall than on winning points at critical times. That’s why tennis is such a psychological sport. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1077))
- if you play the part of the spectator for a moment and generously acknowledge a magnificent piece of play, there you win balance and inner calm. You take the pressure off yourself. In your head, you applaud; visibly, you shrug; and you move on to the next point, aware not that the tennis gods are ranged against you or that you are having a miserable day, but that there is every possibility next time that it will be you who hits the unplayable winner. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1087))
- Understanding the importance of humility is to understand the importance of being in a state of maximum concentration at the crucial stages of a game, knowing that you are not going to go out and win on God-given talent alone. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1093))
- To deny yourself necessary pleasures would be counterproductive. You’d end up feeling bitter, hating training, and even hating tennis, or becoming bored by it, which I ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1144))
- know has happened to players who’ve taken the principle of professional self-denial too far. It is possible to do everything, I believe, but always keeping a balance, never, ever losing track of what’s important. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1146))
- Because there would be days during a tournament when I would not be feeling at my best either and by training in such circumstances I’d be better prepared to compete when I was below par. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVNJTS&location=1173))
