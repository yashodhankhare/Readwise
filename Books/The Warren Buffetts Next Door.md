## Highlights
- There is no one way to achieve success. Each of these people has developed his own particular approach. • They do share two characteristics: hard work and iron discipline. They don’t rely on tips from TV talking heads, friends, or acquaintances. They spend hours digging, and digging hard. They use the Web. While they take in reams of information from the Web and elsewhere, they make up their own minds. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=123))

- Everyone likes to think he or she is disciplined. But most investors give in to their emotions when the market seems to be rising relentlessly or plunging sickeningly. • These next-door Buffetts make mistakes—but they actually learn from them. • Every one of them has suffered a searing market setback. Even investor John Navin, who had successfully avoided devastating losses during the 2008 and early 2009 market meltdown, missed the subsequent market upsurge.

- My hope is that you will read about my 10 Warren Buffetts Next Door and realize that the only real prerequisite to becoming a good investor is committing the time to do so. In other words, invest in yourself. You can achieve great investment returns, meet your financial goals, and beat the professional investors you would otherwise entrust your capital to. For many of us it’s not a choice, but a necessity. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=253))

- Tangible asset value, real earnings, and debt levels are what Rees obsesses about. Just as he did during his vagabond days, he wants to know the bare minimums for a company’s survival so he can determine the risk he faces investing in a stock. Chris Rees wants to know the downside—the worst case. And if a stock is selling at 50 percent of what he reckons its value is, then he buys. Rees’s motto is taken right from the pages of Warren Buffett’s playbook. Simply, “Don’t lose money.” ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=288))

- Simplicity is also a virtue for Rees, and when it comes to investing, Rees’s objective is to have only 10 stocks in his portfolio at any one time. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=298))

- “My basic philosophy is that I don’t believe successful investing is about finding stuff that goes up. I think it’s about finding stuff that’s not going to go down.” To this end Rees is obsessive about determining a company’s tangible asset value, also known as its tangible book value. In conversation he sometimes refers to it as liquidation value. Tangible asset value is defined as a company’s assets minus its liabilities. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=316))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In general, Rees is looking for companies that are selling at a price that is significantly lower than his estimation of its tangible asset value per share. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=321))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Rees cautions investors not to confuse his tangible asset value with the book value figures that are commonly quoted on dozens of web sites, including Yahoo Finance. Book value can be inflated by intangibles like goodwill or obsolete inventory. “Book value is too dodgy, squishy,” says Rees. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=324))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The next thing Rees looks at when investigating a potential stock to buy is its balance sheet, or debt levels. “I don’t like debt. I don’t want anything to do with debt,” he says. “Any business, any CEO who loads up on debt, I’m not interested.” Rees mostly focuses on a company’s debt-to-equity ratio, which he says shouldn’t exceed 50 percent. The last thing Rees looks at in his relatively simple strategy is earnings. “The company has got to be profitable or I have to see a pathway to profitability.” Rees often looks for turnarounds and other special situations. Thus if Rees likes the long-term prospects of a company that will lose money for the next several quarters, before ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=327))

- Buy Rules • Find companies with low debt, less than 50 percent of equity. • Focus on tangible asset value (also known as tangible book value) and be mindful of intangibles that can inflate asset values. • Look at realistic forward earnings potential. Sell Rules • Take profits if the stockholding approaches your estimated fair value. • Sell if market-, sector-, or company-specific risk increases. • Sell if the stock becomes overweighted in the portfolio. • Sell if you find a better, lower-risk investment. • Take profits if you can lower your overall portfolio risk by reallocating capital.

- To be sure, Krebs has never given up buying and holding straight equities, especially high yield dividend stocks and trusts. However, he now enhances this strategy by selling options with three goals in mind—to generate income, to buy into stocks he likes at bargain prices, and to manage his equity risk. Or as he flippantly advises other ValueForum members, “Sell some options, have fun, and make some money.” At first, Krebs focused almost exclusively on a strategy known as covered call writing. Covered call writing is one of the least risky of all options strategies because it allows investors the chance to generate income from stocks they would otherwise have sitting in their portfolios. In options jargon being “covered” means that you have possession of the underlying securities needed if the option is ever exercised. As Krebs puts it, covered call writing is profitable 80 percent of the time. Say, for example, Krebs has a long-term holding of 1,000 shares of IBM (NYSE: IBM) that he purchased at $100 per share. Total invested, ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=552))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- $100,000. Krebs’s goal for his long-term portfolio holdings of IBM might be to use options to generate at least 8 percent in additional income above and beyond the dividends his stock might pay. So Krebs would typically seek out call options that are far “out-of-the-money,” meaning that they are at strike prices higher than IBM’s current price and are thus unlikely to be exercised. If IBM’s stock tends to trade in a range of say $90 and $110, then Krebs would look to sell 10 call option contracts, each representing the right to buy 100 shares, at a strike price of $115 and an expiration three months out. That would give the buyer of these options the right to buy Krebs’s 1,000 shares of IBM from him at a price of $115. If the quoted options price were $3, each contract would be worth $300 and 10 would be worth $3,000. Since Krebs is selling these calls he would receive $3,000 deposited in his brokerage account. If Krebs is correct and IBM’s price doesn’t climb above $115, or more than 15 percent in the ensuing three months, those call options he sold would expire worthless, and Krebs would profit by the $3,000 premium he received. He would ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=560))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- then try to repeat this every three months, adjusting his pricing accordingly. If he can do this successfully, he can generate $12,000 or 12 percent in extra income on that $100,000 in IBM stock that is otherwise sitting in his portfolio. If Krebs is wrong and IBM soars, the investor he sold his options to will exercise his right to buy Krebs’s 1,000 shares of IBM, and Krebs will be closed out of his position at a price of $115,000. Krebs would get to keep the $3,000 he initially received for selling the calls. His gain would be $18,000 or 18 percent. The only losing scenario in covered call writing is if IBM’s shares fall below Krebs’s $100 purchase price, but then again Krebs’s losses are cushioned by the $3,000 or $3 per share premium he got. Thus Krebs doesn’t start to lose money until IBM falls below $97 per share. Another option strategy that Krebs likes to employ he calls naked… ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=569))

- Say Krebs is bullish on gold and he wants to buy shares of Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY), currently trading at $13. Krebs ideally would like to get the shares cheaper, say at $11.50. He could call his broker and put in a good-till canceled limit order for the stock at $11.50, hoping that it will fall in price to that level. Or he could sell ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=584))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- put options for Yamana with a strike price of $12, which might be trading at $0.50 a share. Thus if Yamana’s stock price drops below $12 Krebs will be forced to purchase the underlying stock from the person he sold his “naked” puts to but his cost will be $12 minus the $0.50 per share he received as a premium. Therefore he would own the stock at his goal price of $11.50. Now if Yamana didn’t fall below $12 or went up, Krebs keeps the $0.50 per share premium in income he got for selling the options in the first place. Using these two core options strategies, Krebs seeks to earn from 1.5 percent to 3 percent in extra income from his stock portfolio each month, augmenting the total return he gets. Indeed, Krebs admits that he typically has positions in 50 to 200 options contracts at any given time. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=587))

- “If I am happy owning a stock that is yielding 10 percent, why not see if I can write puts underneath it (out of the money) and pick up another 10 percent in premium income,” says Krebs. “I always focus on the worst-case scenario. In this case, it would mean owning more of the stock at a cheaper price. It’s sort of like putting in a stink bid and being paid to wait while I do this.” ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=659))

- Make sure you aren’t trying to impose your ego on the market. According to Krebs this important rule has a corollary that says avoid at all costs taking a large loss on any single security. When fundamental investors buy stocks, they do so, according to Krebs, with two currencies. One is in the form of the hard dollars they spend to buy their shares and the other is in the form of emotional currency. After all, most serious individual investors spend a good deal of time researching a stock, believing in its story and expecting that they will be rewarded when they are proven correct. “You are putting your emotional opinion on the line as much as you are spending the money,” says Krebs. But what if the market just doesn’t agree with you, regardless of all the effort you have put into your research and the stock continues to go down? Krebs says investors need to swallow their pride and sell. He also warns of an even greater sin. Never double down and add to your holdings using the argument “The sellers are fools! I’ve done my research on this. The stock is even cheaper now!” ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=675))

- Strategy Tip Krebs prefers selling naked puts (naked short puts) to covered call writing on stocks in his portfolio. “Most people don’t realize that from a risk/reward standpoint selling a naked put is the same as buying the stock and covering it by selling a call against it (covered calls). The difference is that you don’t have to supply the money to buy the stock unless your put is exercised.” ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=729))

- The Big Loss is one from which you cannot easily recover. Most investors on ValueForum have a nest egg that they have been building on for years, and they work hard trying to make it grow. The one thing that is generally unacceptable is to incur a Big Loss that will take years of work to recover. Most of us are not in a position to begin building that nest egg from scratch or even building one-half to one-third of that nest egg over again. Most of us can with reasonable risk expect to return 10-20 percent in good market years, but in search of extraordinary gains (30-60 percent) we are usually putting ourselves in a position for a potential Big Loss. Like the old journeyman, we need to take time to look at our investments and our budget situations often and wonder what it would be like to lose a large portion of it. We should objectively look at each investment and determine if under some extraordinary circumstance a Big Loss could occur. This is especially true using options, margin, and leverage. Look at each investment and listen for that little voice that says, “I have taken much too much risk here with too much of my money.” If you hear it, do not then override it with your analytical intellect that says, “It’s okay. I have looked at all the charts and the data and the analysts’ expectations, I ‘know’ it could not possibly result in a Big Loss.” Especially if you have been on a long winning run and your pride has convinced you there is no problem. Heed the little voice and take some risk off the table. Step away from the whirring saw blades of the market and take a break.

- Another factor he uses is based on the theories of Joseph D.

Kai discovered this paper on a well-known academic web site he trolls called Social Science Research Network, or SSRN.com. Piotroski’s paper talks of a nine-point scoring system for finding winning value stocks.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- price-to-book ratio stocks. However, given that many firms with low price-to-book ratios are often distressed, Piotroski also evaluates balance sheet strength return on assets and cash flow. Buying those companies that passed Piotroski’s rigorous test and shorting those that didn’t would have produced a 23 percent average annual return for the two decades between 1976 and 1996. Petainen incorporates some of Piotroski’s tests into his own quantitative formula. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ZRFZ8&location=1243))
