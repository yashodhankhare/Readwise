## Highlights
- Emotions play a central role in financial markets – this is an uncontroversial statement for most market participants. However, for some it borders on intellectual heresy. They argue that, while emotions are present, their impact is mitigated by the arbitrage activities of rational investors and thus markets correctly price assets. But markets do not correctly price assets and indeed emotions trump ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IZISLO6&location=131))

- Successful investing is emotionally difficult. It often requires waiting for long-term results when your portfolio was recently pummelled, recommending an investment when others think it is a dog, investing when volatility is high, and often looking and acting different from the Crowd. To be a successful investor, you must make a conscious decision to control your natural reactions and instead focus on decisions that flow from careful and thoughtful analysis. Staying disciplined in an emotionally-charged, 24-hour news cycle world is a challenge. I believe that releasing your emotional brakes and then harnessing the price distortions created by the cognitive errors of others are the two most important things… ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IZISLO6&location=160))

- Two threads run throughout Behavioral Portfolio Management. First, conventional wisdom regarding the markets and how to invest in them is often wrong. As Einstein said, “Common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age eighteen.” As I ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IZISLO6&location=239))

- The four investments are proxies for choices typically available to investors. The $1 bill represents an investment in default-free treasury bills, the $5 bill an investment in bonds, the $20 bill an investment in the stock market, and the $100 bill an investment in an active equity portfolio earning an excess return. The payoffs roughly capture the relationship of ending values for each of these investments over a long time period, say 30 years.

For example, if the goal is to have a fixed amount at a fixed time in the future (e.g. $100,000 in two years), risk is measured as the chance of ending up with less than $100,000 in two years. In this case, short-term volatility is an important contributor to risk.

- Summarizing the three Basic Principles Behavioral Portfolio Management focuses on the behavioral aspects of financial markets to help make better investment decisions. BPM’s first basic principle is that Emotional Crowds dominate the determination of both stock prices and volatility, with fundamentals playing a small role. This means that more often than not prices reflect emotions rather than underlying value, a consequence of arbitrage failing to keep prices in line with fundamentals. As a result, price distortions are the rule rather ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IZISLO6&location=644))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- than the exception, making it possible for BDIs to build superior portfolios, which is the second basic principle. Volatility and risk are not synonymous. In the case of meeting short-term financial goals, volatility is an important contributor to investment risk, as measured by the chance of underperformance, and this is the third basic principle. On the other hand, volatility plays a much less important role when building long-horizon portfolios. By focusing on short-term volatility when building long-horizon portfolios, the investor injects emotions into the portfolio construction process. It is important to distinguish between emotions and investment risk so that the best decisions can be made. The bottom line is that building successful investment portfolios is straightforward but emotionally difficult. Making decisions based on price distortions created by the Emotional Crowd and ignoring short-term volatility when building long-horizon portfolios presents significant challenges for investment professionals. This is because such a strategy is frequently going against the Crowd, thus depriving the client of social validation, and in turn asking them to set aside the strong emotions associated with volatile prices.

I then ran various statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, serial correlation and a runs test. Consistently the made up series was not truly random and in fact had significant mean reversion, as can be seen in Figure 3.2 (highly significant first-order serial correlation of -0.16).

Indeed, the Economic Conditions strategy is one of the worst performing US strategies of the ten that have been identified by AthenaInvest, consistent with the notion that top-down economic strategies perform poorly. Even so, given all of the talking heads, there is a strong desire by investors to use current economic information for making investment decisions.

- One of the stranger things that has swept over the investment industry is the style grid. It is based on the idea of categorizing active equity managers, as well as other managers, by the market cap and the PE ratio of the stocks they hold. So a fund is categorized as small-cap value if it holds small market capitalization and low P/E ratio stocks.

- Once this concept was introduced, it grew to dominate the industry, driven by a leaderless stampede. Now virtually everyone uses it for categorizing funds and building portfolios. Even worse, research shows that performance is hurt by keeping a manager in a style box. Funds perform best when the manager consistently pursues a strategy and takes high-conviction positions and so by demanding that a manager stay in a style box, the manager is being asked to purchase stocks that may have nothing to do with the strategy being pursued.

Strategy is the way a manager goes about analyzing, buying and selling stocks over time, while portfolio characteristics, such as market capitalization and value-growth, describe the equity holdings that result. There is no reason to believe that portfolio characteristics remain constant over time as an equity strategy is successfully executed. One of the bizarre outcomes of equating strategy and characteristics is the introduction of style drift. Believing that characteristics and strategy are synonymous, the industry requires managers to avoid style drift, or in other words, maintain the same stock characteristics regardless of economic and market ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IZISLO6&location=1931))

However if the portfolio is broken into buckets, with one of those buckets devoted to liquidity and short-term income needs and another bucket devoted to capital growth, then this benefit is of little value.
