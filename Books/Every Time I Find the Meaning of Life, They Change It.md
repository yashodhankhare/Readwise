## Highlights
- “Every time I find the meaning of life, they change it.” ______ —REINHOLD NIEBUHR, AMERICAN SOCIAL PHILOSOPHER AND THEOLOGIAN ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=50))

- About halfway through that notebook, my notations switched to ballpoint pen and my comments on the philosophers’ quotes dwindled to just a few words, like “There’s got to be a better way” and “Help!” The final entry was from the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: “Every time I find the meaning of life, they change it.” Under it I had scribbled, “Now you tell me!” I must have been in my midthirties when I closed the book on “Pithies.” My first reaction when I leafed through the notebook these decades later was to cringe at how naïve I had been. Did I really think I could learn how to live my life from philosophers, many of whom had lived thousands of years ago? What could I have been thinking?

- That’s unfortunate, I thought, looking through my old notebook. After initially scoffing at my youthful naïveté, I now realized that those how-to-live questions were still very much alive in my mind. Sure, time had crept on and my life, with its ups and downs, had simply happened, as lives tend to do, but my appetite for philosophical ideas about life had not diminished in the least. In fact, as I look at life from the vantage point of my eighth decade, my hankering for such ideas has only increased. Late in the game as it may be, I still want to live my final years the best way I can. But more compellingly, I find myself at that stage of life when I want to give my personal history one last look-through, and I am curious to see how it measures up to fully considered ideas of a good life. So, forty years after my last entry in “Pithies,” I started jotting down new thoughts about those philosophers’ quotes I had long ago copied in that notebook. And then I started collecting new ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=90))

- “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” ............................. —EPICURUS, GREEK PHILOSOPHER (341–270 BC), HEDONIST ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=115))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In this aphorism, Epicurus is making two related points: First, desiring what we do not have now diminishes or even cancels out our appreciation of what we do have now; and second, when we take a moment to consider the outcome of actually getting that something else that we now desire, we will realize that it is just going to put us back at square one—desiring yet something else. The overall lesson is: Enjoy the present—it’s as good as it gets. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=126))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Pondering outcomes is fundamental to Epicurus’s general strategy for living a happy life. Not only should we think through the payoff of always desiring something more than what we have now, we should carefully think through the payoffs of all our desires. Like how do you think you would really feel if you followed your desire to bed your neighbor’s wife? Figure in your guilt ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=130))

- and scheduling complications. Still worth it? Epicurus gives teeth to the old adage, “Beware of what you desire, for you may get it.” ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=133))

- An insidious manner in which we fall into the aspirations trap is in our reverence for perfectionism. We are convinced that this quality is a sign of noble character. We urge our children to be perfectionists. But the outcome of perfectionism is that we are constantly looking for ways in which we or our products could be better. A successful painter I know once told me that when she looks at her work in a gallery, she always focuses on what is missing, what would have made it better. Epicurus is right: That is a guaranteed way never to feel completely fulfilled. Is Epicurus suggesting that ideally we go through life without any desires at all? Just be happy with what we have and what we are currently doing? Nip all our longings in the bud all the way back to sexual desire and an appetite for meatloaf? Is that the only way to lead the happiest life? Epicurus definitely thought so and he was that rare philosopher who not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. He chose celibacy for himself because he was convinced that sex inevitably led to unhappy feelings like jealousy and boredom. And although his diet was richer than the Buddha’s one grain of rice per day, Epicurus seemed happy to subsist on bread and water with an occasional lentil thrown in when he was feeling devilish. Like many philosophers, Epicurus was a man of extremes, choosing the perfect symmetry of black-and-white alternatives over nuanced subclauses of options. But unlike many philosophers, he really did practice his purist philosophy in his own life. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=138))

- My dog, Snookers, is a natural hedonist and one reason for that is that he does not hold a long view of his life. He does not desist from eating a yummy cache of overripe mackerel he finds in our compost heap because it will cause him stomach cramps a few hours later. What’s “later” to Snookers? He simply enjoys each moment without analyzing future outcomes, poor guy. That little doggie does not have a clue of how to go about weighing his options, let alone making tradeoffs. We humans are far better equipped for that. Or are we? Modern psychology raises some serious questions about our ability to foresee gratifying outcomes. In his remarkable book Stumbling on Happiness, Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert demonstrates that we humans have a lousy record at predicting what will make us happy, from with whom we pair off to where we live. In most cases, Gilbert says, we would have the same chance of finding happiness by flipping a coin as we do by carefully deliberating our options.

- Still, Epicurus’s Zenlike lesson does hit home for me, in fact more now than it did when I first read it. Although generally I do not drift away from the present by desiring more, frequently I do drift away from the present by fantasizing about what’s coming up next. I now realize that I have spent much of my life thinking about “What’s next?” While eating dinner, I will start thinking about what book I am going to read or what movie I am going to watch after dinner. Meantime, I am not focusing on my lovely mouthful of mashed potatoes. In fact, “What’s next?” has been the leitmotif of my life. As a child, I constantly thought about what my life would be when I grew up; later, about what… ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=158))

- “The art of life lies in taking pleasures as they pass, and the keenest pleasures are not intellectual, nor are they always moral.” ............................. —ARISTIPPUS, GREEK/LIBYAN PHILOSOPHER (435–356 BC), HEDONIST ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=177))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- No, this ancient Greek philosopher urges us to get down and dirty. He wants us to be hedonists in the sense that word is used today: pure pleasure seekers. Sensualists! Animals! Is Aristippus talking about that fancy sports car complete with the hot blonde/gorgeous Romeo in the passenger seat? You betcha, if that is your “keenest” pleasure. How about orgies? Go for it, says Aristippus. It even appears that the “art of life” could include some passing masochism if one agrees with the original sadomasochist, the Marquis de Sade, who wrote, “It is always by way of pain that one arrives at pleasure.” ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=187))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As a guide to seeking out life’s pleasures, Aristippus flips Epicurus’s basic premise of hedonism upside down. Whereas Epicurus would have us rein in our desires and aspirations so that we can get the most pleasure out of what is right in front of us, Aristippus urges us to actively manipulate what is in front of us in order to maximize our pleasure. Man is the architect of his own pleasure dome. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=203))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Still, I definitely find something refreshing about Aristippus’s unequivocal, no-nonsense brand of hedonism. Among other things, it is not so cerebral as other philosophers’ brands and for good reason: Aristippus was convinced that intellectual pleasures do not begin to measure up to sensual pleasures. My dog, Snookers, would agree with Aristippus—that is, if Snookers knew what agreement was. Yet therein lies the reason why I, personally, cannot subscribe to Aristippus’s art of life: I simply am not comfortable seeing myself as an animal with only animal appetites. Don’t get me wrong: I love and admire animals, Snookers in particular, but my human consciousness just cannot be denied. I guess it took Aristippus to force me to admit to myself just how anthropocentric I am. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=224))

- When Indian and Ceylonese tea first came to England in the mid–seventeenth century, imbibers wrote rhapsodic essays about how deliriously happy this “hypnotic” made them. Some said they could not sleep for days afterward, so wired and besotted were they by one cup of the stuff. According to one eighteenth-century commentator, tea was so habit-forming that it did not take long for all of Great Britain to develop a serious tea addiction. So why, then, does your average, twenty-first-century London matron who consumes five cups of tea daily seem so sedate, so very far from ecstatic? Because they had stronger tea back in the old days? That’s unlikely. It is probably because being high/stoned/drunk is always relative to “normal” consciousness, both normal for an individual and normal for the culture in which he lives. Over the centuries, virtually everyone in England has developed “tea consciousness.” That is not because absolutely everyone there drinks tea, but because a sufficient number did and do and their ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=265))

- resulting consciousness became the norm. The culture born of tea consciousness informs daily language and personal interactions; it becomes part of the process of successful socialization. If virtually everyone regularly ate magic mushrooms, “magic-mushroom consciousness” would eventually become our norm. If you spent a long period of time in a magic-mushroom-consuming community, you would soon realize that their language and its commonly understood referents are markedly different from those of talk around your home dinner table. The mushroom people are speaking the language of psychedelic consciousness and, over time, you would very likely acquire that consciousness and language whether or not you were a mushroom eater yourself. Similarly, computers and social media have changed the consciousness of our culture, affecting—without our fully realizing it—our accepted ideas of a normal attention span and personal intimacy. The end result is that eventually tea (or mushroom or computer) consciousness simply begins to feel like normal consciousness, not higher or better consciousness. The feeling of being high ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=272))

- is in its contrast to everyday consciousness; the only way we can feel high is for there to be something to feel higher than. In order for that London matron to feel more euphoric, she would have to try something else, say a glass or two of scotch at teatime; but, of course, that would only work for a limited amount of time because after a while “scotch consciousness” would become her normal consciousness. It is worth noting that people who are drunk all day every day do not strike me as a particularly happy lot. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=281))

- The critical point is that knowing we can always get higher can be a real downer. It informs us that we are never going to reach the ultimate point of happiness because there is no ultimate point of happiness. There is always a higher mountain thataway. For someone seeking ultimate bliss, this is a sobering thought. It all starts to feel futile. But not to worry: Soon enough the mountain on which we are currently sitting becomes our new normal consciousness and our level of happiness feels more or less the way it always has. Experimental psychologists refer to this as our “happiness set point.” Their research suggests that inducing happy feelings cannot have lasting effects on our sense of well-being. Their “hedonic treadmill” thesis says that we constantly habituate ourselves to acquired levels of happiness and so we simply return to our original baseline level of feeling. Here is where the “set-point” theory starts to both intrigue and confuse me. If everyone eventually returns to some baseline feeling, why are some people’s baselines higher than others’? And why are some cultures’ baselines higher than others’? Different societies clearly do have different general levels of well-being. The overall self-evaluated happiness of the people in southern Europe is significantly higher than that of the people in northern Europe. The Italians and Greeks laugh and smile more than the Germans and Dutch. They also take more pleasure in simple routines, like eating long lunches and sitting around and chatting. (This may very well be the root cause of the north-south economic tensions involving the euro currency; the northern Europeans think the southerners are lazy, while the southerners think the northerners don’t know ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=293))

- how to live a good life.) While teaching for a semester in Rome, I read a newspaper survey of how the average Roman occupied his day: He spent a lot more time eating, napping, and chewing the fat than his counterpart in Berlin. My favorite statistic was that the average Roman spent an hour and a half each day listening to music. That must be hedonism at its most sublime. In any event, Pearce will have none of this set-point theory. He points out that depressed people who take Prozac feel a lot better than they did before taking the antidepressant and most continue to feel that way as long as they take the pill. What is more, these people are fully conscious that they feel better than when they were depressed and are grateful for it. So, asks Pearce, why shouldn’t we all take pills or, for that matter, get electrical neurostimulation implants that continuously make us feel good, that make us, as Pearce says, “feel better than simply well”? He insists that our society and our psychotherapists have established the base point of feeling good and happy way too low. He writes, “[I]f we recalibrate our typical emotional set-point, then the greatest happiness principle can be implemented ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=306))

- far more successfully than in the wildest dreams of Bentham.” But Pearce doesn’t give the full story here. A significant number of people on Prozac need to increase their dosage continually to stay free of depression. Could that be because after a while their medicated happiness set point starts to feel drab, even depressing? Wouldn’t that happen with neurostimulation implants, too? Pearce doesn’t fully answer the relativity-of-well-being problem. Okay, one more question about the genuine possibility of feeling terrific all the time. Taking a quick survey of the most ecstatic moments in my life, I would have to put sexual experiences at the top of the list. Now would I want all of my life to be one long orgasm? Alas, I think not, and I do not believe this is my age talking.

- Sometimes Pearce’s argument for the perfectly happy man seems to me like hedonism gone mad. It feels like a vision of la-la land, a place where we are no longer genuinely human. But for that very reason, I think this young philosopher is absolutely brilliant. More than any other philosopher I know of, Pearce compels us to examine the foundation of hedonism. Is pleasure all we really want in our lives? That must be pretty close to the first question for any philosophy of life.

- Also like Epicurus, Schopenhauer believed that reducing our expectations was the primary way to beat the blues. The German philosopher put it bluntly: “The safest way of not being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy.” You have to love those words “very miserable”; Schopenhauer could not be content with simply saying “unhappy” as Epicurus did. From there, Schopenhauer’s philosophy continues downhill, way downhill. In his tome The World as Will and Representation, he writes, “The shortness of life, so often lamented, may be the best thing about it.” In The Vanity of Existence, he writes, “Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will be sufficiently obvious if we only remember that man is a compound of needs and necessities hard to satisfy; and that even when they are satisfied, all he obtains is a state of painlessness. . . .

- The power of Camus’s statement begins with the fact that in the world of living creatures, only human beings are able to contemplate and carry out suicide as a conscious decision. To those quibblers who believe that salmon commit suicide via their perilous swim back to their spawning pools, I can only say that I am pretty sure salmon do not cash it all in as the result of deep philosophical reflection. If a human is conscious and mobile and reasonably resourceful, he can freely decide to kill himself and then do it. Most of us have never genuinely considered this possibility. We know rationally that suicide is an option, but we may not have ever truly contemplated it—not focused on it with head and ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=462))

Before going on, it is important to note that Camus omits the psychological perspective on the suicide question, namely that a mentally ill person could be in such deep psychological pain that suicide appears to be the only way out, the only relief. Most psychiatrists would say that such people actually do have other options, such as medication and psychotherapy. More significantly, they would also say that suicidal people are not rational by definition—that anybody who commits suicide acts irrationally. Camus, of course, would say that genuinely contemplating suicide can be supremely rational. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=467))

- “My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.” ............................. —WILLIAM JAMES, AMERICAN PHILOSOPHER (1842–1910), PRAGMATIST ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=492))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If Epicurus was the Prince of Pith, William James was its CEO. In the above statement, he gives the most succinct and efficient argument I know of for adopting a belief in free will. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=499))
- I am always drawn to the no-nonsense pragmatism of William James. His goal is to make philosophy relevant to real life, and on the question of free will he does so wonderfully and with his usual wit: “My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.” His underlying point is that there is no objective and scientific way to prove the existence of a free will. You can’t see one, even with an X-ray machine (discovered during James’s lifetime). Therefore, accepting its existence is akin to an act of faith; it is something we can choose to believe in. Herein lies James’s little gag: Choosing to believe in anything is an act of will; without a will, no choices exist. In fact, how could you “choose” not to believe in free will? In that case, some determinant must have forced the choice. So there is something wonderfully circular about James’s ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=530))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- free will declaration; he is already accepting the idea of a free will by the very act of making a choice; in this instance, the choice to believe in a free will. The pragmatic piece of James’s decision is that believing in a free will feels intuitive. It is fundamental to what feeling human is all about; it is basic to being an “I.” That is, right up until we find it useful or comforting to believe that uncontrollable forces determine our actions. Then we are back in “the devil made me do it” territory. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please consider my traumatic childhood when you pass judgment on me—my upbringing made me do it. And then there is my all-time favorite, “the Twinkie Defense”—All that sugar in the Twinkie I ate made me pull the trigger—from an actual San Francisco murder trial. I wonder how a person’s behavior would change if he thought his every choice was determined. How would he go about letting things happen determinably? And who, exactly, would be making the decision to let things happen that way?

- gratifying way to get through a day, let alone a lifetime. But William James was not a dewy-eyed philosopher who was totally content with his pragmatic argument for acting as though free will existed. (I, on the other hand, am perfectly content with this argument.) Some years later, lecturing to students at Harvard Divinity School, James explored the free will question in a heady and wonderfully imaginative way, employing my favorite philosophical method, the thought experiment. He begins by asking, “What is meant by saying that my choice of which way to walk home after the lecture is ambiguous and matter of chance? . . . It means that both Divinity Avenue and Oxford Street are called [to mind as alternatives] but only one, and that one either one, shall be chosen.” And then begins his wild… ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=545))

You, as passive spectators, look on and see the two alternative universes—one of them with me walking through Divinity Avenue in it, the other with the same me walking through Oxford Street. Now, if you are determinists you believe one of these universes to have been from eternity impossible: you believe it to have been impossible because of the intrinsic irrationality or accidentally somewhere involved in it. But looking outwardly at these universes, can you say which is the impossible and accidental one, and which the rational and necessary one? I doubt if the most ironclad determinist among you could have the slightest glimmer of light on this… ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=553))

- Sartre is not merely describing this potential that is unique to human beings, he is exhorting us to embrace it and with it our responsibility for whom we become. If we sidestep this human capacity, we abandon our very being. We allow ourselves to become just another object. Sartre’s catalogue of the various ways we unthinkingly manage to turn ourselves into objects—to act as if our essence precedes our existence—is daunting. We slough off the responsibility to create ourselves by shrugging and claiming, “That’s just the way I am.” “I smoke because I have an addictive personality—that’s just the kind of guy I am.” Or, “I believe in the God of Abraham because my mother told me to—that’s just the way I grew up.” Another dodge we try on ourselves is to identify our essential natures with a predetermined role, say that of wife. “I am a wife—that is simply my identity.” Of course, if we choose the identity of “wife,” that’s perfectly authentic, but if we think we are predefined by ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=582))

- Leopardi’s philosophy can be summed up in the old adage, “Things can only get so bad . . . and then they get worse.” He saw all of life as if it were the denouement of an old Russian curse. Like, “You should find a ruble on the sidewalk but be too arthritic to lean over and pick it up.” Or, one of my favorites, “May they find a thousand new cures for you each year.” This Italian saw life as a grand joke: We are handed a life full of promise, but all we end up with is one disappointment after another. Ha, ha. Philosophical pessimism is not merely an emotional attitude toward life, it is a rebuke of the very notion of progress. It is a reproof of the Western ethos of earnestly pursuing a more perfect world—all those ideologies that propel social and political movements, not to mention every ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=689))

- self-improvement strategy we’ve ever tried. In a world full of trap doors that willy-nilly drop us into frustration and despair, working for progress is a joke—and a sick joke, at that. On top of that, philosophical pessimism takes a pot shot at the optimism born of faith in a beneficent, well-meaning god. Yet Leopardi is a pessimist with an upbeat kicker: Once we fully acknowledge that life is doomed to perpetual disappointment, we can have a good laugh about it, and that turns out to be liberating. That is when the fun begins in an ironic, bittersweet sort of way. His outlook resembles that of the 1960s pop anthem of existential futility, “Is That All There Is?” As Peggy Lee sang, “If that’s all there is my friends, then let’s keep dancing / Let’s break out the booze and have a ball.” Wrote Leopardi, “He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like he who is prepared to die.” And in his Manual of Practical Philosophy, he took a dig at the pursuit of happiness: “If all you seek from something is pleasure, you’ll never find it.

- When the nineteenth-century social philosopher John Stuart Mill laid down the Greatest Happiness Principle as the basis of Utilitarianism, he stressed that purely animal pleasures don’t make the grade. Wrote Mill, “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.” For him, there are lower pleasures and higher pleasures, with intellectual fun being the high-quality stuff. Call it Cerebral Hedonism. I think, therefore I feel good. Russell is not just saying that thinking is a prerequisite for leading a gratifying life as Socrates meant when he said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” Rather, Russell believes that examining life is one of the essential treats that make life worth living. He thinks that thinking is delightful in itself, possibly even better than a roll in the hay. It is worth noting that unlike the celibate Epicurus, Russell had a very active sex life both within and without marriage, so he does ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=727))

- not speak naïvely about the “goods of the body.” There are just good goods and then there are very good goods—the kind you pick up while sitting alone in your easy chair puzzling over philosophical questions. It is philosophical thinking that Russell finds particularly life-enriching. In his lovely and highly accessible essay “The Value of Philosophy,” Russell demonstrates how confronting the big questions enlarges us. Questions like: “Has the universe any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse of atoms? Is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving hope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on a small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible? Are good and evil of importance to the universe or only to man?” Russell readily admits that such questions are ultimately unanswerable. He says that “those questions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in the sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.” It is that residue of unanswerable questions that he finds so stimulating and inspiring.

- In other words, base your relationships on the commercial model of quid pro quo: If you do for me, I’ll do for you. It sounds like La Rochefoucauld’s “social arrangement, a mutual adjustment of interests, an interchange of services given and received.” Is that what we want to mean by “friendship”? Recently, a friend of mine told me that she had worked out a tidy and workable formula for sustaining her marriage even though she and her husband had been growing further and further apart for many years. She said they no longer shared the same values; in fact, they saw just about everything in the world so differently that it was impossible to have anything but contentious conversations with each other. But they had three children and she felt it was incumbent upon her to keep the marriage going. Hence her formula, which consisted of setting extreme boundaries on what could and could not be discussed and at what points they would temporarily withdraw from each other. It sounded to me like something one might read in a business manual on how to keep antagonistic employees from gouging each other’s eyes out.

Surprisingly, my friend was taken aback by my comment. She had not thought about her situation in those terms. She had been living without genuine closeness for so long that she seemed to have forgotten how much she actually valued it and longed for it. And no “boundaries” formula was going to change that; indeed, it would only codify a way to live without the possibility of closeness. She realized that what she ultimately needed to decide was if she was willing to live without intimacy for the rest of her life.

It is a treat to be able to appreciate simply being alive and usually that treat is not available when I am in the company of others. It tends to get lost in the crowd. Nonetheless, I am not so sold on solitude as was Henry David Thoreau, the American philosopher who spent months on end alone on Walden Pond. He, apparently, did have deep thoughts deep in the woods.

There is a lot of that in our lives—for example, a party, the kind where people flit from group to group and shmooze amiably, often entertainingly, but not really personally. At such gatherings, it is nearly impossible to feel even an intimation of intimacy. I prefer solitude to that. This may well be an old man thing that comes from a sense of time running out and not wanting to waste a moment of it. I would rather spend my remaining time breathing in and out in my chair behind the house than spend it being the life of a party.

One thing about living in a psychological era is that few people give credence or value to a philosophical perspective. In our period, despairing of finding any meaning in life is rarely considered a sincerely held worldview; no, it is a sickness that needs to be cured. If I said to a psychiatrist that by treating existential ennui as a disease he is making the gratuitous assumption that the correct way to live is cheerfully and hopefully, he would look at me as if I was, well, sick in the head. Most shrinks presuppose that the goal of life is to become positive and to have a sense of well-being and that it is not healthy to feel or think otherwise. But what if, after philosophical contemplation, a person finds life empty? What if he cannot find any meaning in life, either rationally or in the depths of his being?

Witness the difference it would have made to the people of Bedford Falls if George Bailey had never lived, as demonstrated by Clarence Odbody, Angel Second Class. For those who somehow missed this movie, It’s a Wonderful Life is a classic Frank Capra film about a man, George Bailey, who contemplates suicide because he thinks he has failed his family and community, but Angel Clarence sets George straight by showing him how Bedford Falls would have turned out if George had ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1010))

- never existed. Not good at all, and that is because George significantly affected the lives around him with his small acts of kindness. The idea is that every little thing we do has repercussions that reach far and wide even if we do appear oysterlike. The Wonderful Life theory is a social-behavior variation on the Butterfly Effect, which suggests that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in one part of the globe can be the determining cause of a hurricane in another part of the globe. Devised by Edward Lorenz, an American meteorologist and chaos theory physicist, the Butterfly Effect basically postulates that over time a small event can generate big changes. So be it for George Bailey’s small acts of kindness, not to mention yours and mine. Of course, the problem with any chain of cause and effect is where it all begins. Like, why should the Lorenz chain start with the flapping of that butterfly’s wings? Wasn’t there a cause of that? And of the cause of that cause? Is it causes all the way down?

- Albert Camus was the first modern philosopher to proclaim our confrontation with absurdity as a central problem of philosophy. In his seminal essay The Myth of Sisyphus, he wrote that Absurdism emanates from the dissonance between man’s natural desire to find meaning in his life and the impossibility of finding that meaning in any rational way. The absurdity does not lie in a logical contradiction, but in an existential contradiction; it is the primary puzzle of human existence. We long for meaning but we can’t get it. Camus said there are three basic responses to confronting this absurdity: 1) commit suicide (life is meaningless and futile, so who needs it?); 2) take a Kierkegaardian leap of faith to a belief in God (it is just as irrational as anything else, so why not go for something really Big?); or 3) accept the absurdity of it all but carry on anyhow.

- Next day, still paralyzed on his railway station bench, Horner is approached by a doctor who diagnoses him with “cosmopsis”—a Barth neologism for the inability to choose from all imaginable choices. So off Horner goes to the doctor’s clinic, Remobilization Farm, for therapy that includes reading both the works of Sartre and the World Almanac. Until Horner gets a hold on his life, the doctor prescribes a method for making his daily choices: “[D]on’t let yourself get stuck between alternatives, or you’re lost. You’re not that strong. If the alternatives are side by side, choose the one on the left; if they’re consecutive in time, choose the earlier. If neither of these applies, choose the alternative whose name begins with the earlier letter of the alphabet. These are the principles of Sinistrality, Antecedence, and Alphabetical Priority—there are others, and they’re arbitrary, but useful.” The doctor’s treatment for overcoming choice-making paralysis then goes on to “mythotherapy,” adopting “masks” to abolish the ego by acting out symbolic roles. This is Existentialism gone wacky. Beside its comedy, the main reason The End of the Road means so much to me is that it brings Existentialism directly into ordinary life, where Existentialism properly belongs. No hard-to-fathom abstractions about Being and Nothingness here. This is an uproarious manual on how to get through a day when every alternative seems equally worthless.

It is in my own best interest to follow the Golden Rule because by following it I will promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people, and that, most of the time, is good for me. So what we have here is virtuous behavior as enlightened self-interest. But I am still left with the question, how does my following the Golden Rule ensure that the people around me will follow it also?

What I don’t like about Peter Singer is that after reading him I often feel guilty. Very guilty. These two are closely related: I end up feeling guilty because usually I don’t actually do the things that his concrete moral scenarios convince me that I should do. Here is an example of the way Singer gets to us: He recounts the plot of the Brazilian film Central Station, in which a poor woman, Dora, suddenly has the chance to make a quick thousand dollars. All she has to do is persuade a little street urchin to go with her to a house where, she has been told, wealthy foreigners want to adopt him. Dora does the job and then uses her newly acquired money to buy… ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1305))

- At this point, everyone who hears this story is horrified. We have not a single doubt that it is morally incumbent upon Dora to try to rectify the horror she has unknowingly aided. No one in his right moral mind would say, Hey, it’s just another poor street kid and Dora sure is enjoying her new television set, so what the hell. That would be unconscionable. (In the film, Dora does the right thing.) This is when Singer closes in for the kill: He informs us that in the First World we spend over a third of our money on nonessentials like color TVs. Instead, we could take that money and give it to Oxfam to aid the street urchins of Rio—to feed them and keep them safe from harm.

- its job fairly and properly? Doesn’t charity ultimately lead to dependence and laziness? Those kinds of rationales don’t get much traction with me. The more nuanced, philosophical counterarguments point out that Singer is working by analogy—Dora’s action or inaction about the boy is analogous to our action or inaction on giving to Oxfam. But Singer’s analogy is imperfect. For example, if we decide not to give to Oxfam we are not actively contributing to anybody’s death, whereas by bringing the boy to those foreigners, Dora was actively, even if unwittingly, contributing to his death. True. In fact, strictly speaking, no analogies are perfect. If they were, they wouldn’t be analogies, they would be equivalents. In any event, this “actively” versus “nonactively” argument does not cut it for me either.

- WHEN I AM FEELING BAD ABOUT NOT BEING GOOD—LIKE AFTER reading one of Peter Singer’s moral dilemma fables—it is always invigorating to take a deep swig of Machiavelli, the Ethicist of Bad. In his famous essay The Prince, Machiavelli laid out a detailed program for how to get ahead in the world. The Florentine philosopher may have been the first to write what Amazon.com now calls “A ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1342))

- Life Motivation and Self-Help Book.” God knows, when I copied this line into my notebook back in the 1960s, I needed all the motivation and help I could get. The Prince’s underlying principle is that “might is right.” What we ought to do is get the job done; so what we should do is whatever it takes to get that job done, even if that involves deceit and fraud. Forget about “doing good” as our principal “ought”; it just muddies things up. There are wars to be won, nations to be annexed, people to be subjugated so they will not become unruly. Not only is “doing good” a waste of time and resources, it is counterproductive: It gives our competitors just the advantage they need to screw us. Because we can count on it: They are not dithering about what is the “right thing to do” as they reach for their daggers. The Church, of course, did not approve of Machiavelli’s thesis. Since its inception, the Church has been of the Goodness-Is-Its-Own-Reward school of ethics. One does not do the right thing for personal gain; one does it simply to be a good ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1348))

- person. Well, that and to please God, but ultimately these two are pretty much the same. What is more, if doing good requires a personal sacrifice, it puts a person up into an even higher level of goodness. Long before the Church weighed in on levels of goodness, this hierarchy had already been elaborated by the Hebrews in the ancient text of rules and laws, the Talmud. Interpreting the Talmud, the medieval scholar Maimonides laid out the levels of Tzedakah (charity), from lowest to highest: 1. Giving begrudgingly. 2. Giving less than you should, but giving it cheerfully. 3. Giving after being asked. 4. Giving before being asked. 5. Giving when you do not know the recipient’s identity, but the recipient knows your identity. 6. Giving when you know the recipient’s identity, but the recipient does not know your identity.

- Most relevantly here, moral philosophers took exception to the way some psychologists conflated the way people do behave with the way people ought to behave. These philosophers point to the fallacious “appeal to nature”—the assumption that what is natural is inherently good. And it is not only psychologists who make this mistake. For example, some people claim that homosexuality is unnatural—it doesn’t promote procreation as Nature intends sex to do—therefore homosexuality is bad. Among other problems with this jump in logic is that there are loads of examples of homosexual activity in nature, from barn owls to bison to bonobo monkeys. What’s more, I have never met a homosexual who didn’t believe his practices felt perfectly natural to him. Greene does not fall victim to this fallacy.

- To demonstrate his ideas, Parfit often uses thought experiments, hypothetical scenarios that feel like wild mental roller-coaster rides. After my third or fourth hair-raising plunge down Parfit’s roller-coaster tracks, I am usually ready to entertain just about any idea. Incidentally, I believe thought experiments are the most promising way contemporary philosophers are making philosophy attractive and accessible to all of us. So fasten your seatbelts. Parfit’s aim in the following thought experiment is to demonstrate that personal identity is a slippery thing at best, so questions of moral responsibility are far more complicated than we usually believe they are. Here goes: “Suppose that you enter a cubicle in which, when you press a button, a scanner records the states of all the cells in your brain and body, destroying both while doing so.

Is this thing on Mars that thinks it is you any different from the thing that used to be you on Earth? Philosophers make a distinction between qualitative differences and numerical differences. Two cars that are exactly the same model and color are numerically different but qualitatively identical. On the other hand, Superman and Clark Kent are qualitatively different but numerically identical—same guy, but with different qualities; Superman’s ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound is not something Clark can do. Parfit says the two yous in his thought experiment are clearly numerically different. Call the “you” who once existed on Earth You #1, and the one who now exists on Mars You #2.… ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1476))

Try to think of what could possibly make the two Yous different from each other besides their numerical difference. I’ve tried. Can’t do it.

- Again, Parfit believes that over time personal identity is nothing more than what he calls “psychological continuity,” all those ongoing memories, personality traits, mannerisms, interests, and so on that make Brown Brown, whatever body he happens to be inhabiting. That’s it. Personal identity is nothing else—not, say, a particular material object or, at the other end of the spectrum, some kind of a metaphysical entity like a soul. One of my favorite Sardar jokes perfectly illustrates Parfit’s distinction between self-as-an-object and self-as-psychological-continuity (in Indian humor, Sardars are stereotypically literal-minded to the point of ridiculousness): Riding on the train to Mumbai, a Sardar wants to take a nap but does not want to miss his station, so he asks the compartment’s other occupant to wake him up when they get close to Mumbai. He tells this fellow that he will give him 100 rupees for this service.

- Parfit’s point in the Garbo fantasy is that personal identity is a matter of degree, as in “now more Garbo than Parfit.” Analogously, in our real, non-thought-experiment lives, our memories of our experiences, including memories of past thoughts and feelings, are also a matter of degree. They are on a scale of weak to strong. So it seems reasonable ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1524))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- to say that our weak memories constitute less of our personal identity than do our strong memories. Likewise, our convictions and tastes. In short, it is an illusion to think of identity as a static, absolute phenomenon as we usually do because ultimately identity is a matter of degree—it’s all relative. When my wife says to me, “You aren’t the man I married,” Parfit would say that she is on to something. At some point, in fact, if I became more Garbo than Danny, she would definitely have legitimate grounds for leaving me—well, not exactly leaving me. Now back to that quote of Parfit’s which I recently jotted down in my “Pithies” notebook: “People deserve much less punishment, or even perhaps no punishment, for what they did many years ago as compared to with what they did very recently.” The idea here is that many years ago, someone—say, someone called Ralphy—was not entirely the same person he is today. For example, today Ralphy may have totally forgotten that time he forged his brother’s signature on a check and got away with ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1526))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- it. In the intervening years, Ralphy may have become an upstanding citizen. Or not. It doesn’t really matter; Parfit is not suggesting some kind of forgive-and-forget morality. He is simply saying that over time, what with his waxing and waning of memories and convictions, Ralphy has become a significantly different person. So what sense would it make to punish this “new” Ralphy for something the “old” Ralphy did so many years ago? Yes, there is clearly some relationship between these two Ralphies, but with the passage of time, that relationship has become weaker and weaker to the point where punishing one for the other’s crime does not make good sense. That conclusion certainly is hard to buy. In fact, Parfit’s reasoning is so counterintuitive that it can easily sound trivial and goofy, like a late-night theory spun by a stoner. That was my first impression. But then I tried to find a rigorous and rational concept of personal identity that was more than just psychological continuity. Not easy. Slippery thing, being a “me.” ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZN8S&location=1535))

- nonexistent being has a mother. It reminds me of that wonderful Yogi Berra–ism about a St. Louis restaurant: “Nobody goes there anymore, it’s so crowded.” In paradoxes, we get to have things both ways: We can be both a believer and a nonbeliever in one breath. Of course, we also get to be neither, because the two prongs of the paradox cancel each other out. Not all paradoxes are conceived of as jokes, but nonetheless they tend to strike us as funny, as counterintuitive incongruities tend to do. A favorite of philosophers is one based on Bertrand Russell’s paradox and known as the Barber Paradox: “In a town where the sole barber, a man, shaves all the male citizens of the town who do not shave themselves, does the barber shave himself?” Makes me laugh.

And the Teacher even goes so far as to hint that making the most of our short, meaningless time here is worth a try. No uplift in this chapter of the Bible. I certainly have gone through periods of my life when I felt overwhelmed by the meaninglessness of it all, but I never felt the need to advertise it, as the Teacher does. It certainly is not a lesson I ever felt the urge to pass on to my daughter or granddaughter. And therein lies a realization I had recently: Even in my darkest moments, I cannot think of my daughter’s life or my granddaughter’s life as meaningless. Their mere existence feels meaningful to me whenever I think about them. How could such vital and beautiful creatures possibly be insignificant?

Admitting to ourselves how little we know and, more significantly, how little is even knowable, can be a real eye-opener. There is an awful lot of unknowable stuff out there, but somehow that does not keep us from wanting to know about it or, at least, to keep wondering about it. And wondering about the unknowable certainly inclineth a mind toward the spiritual. Many of my whiffs of Bacon’s meaning come when I think about the division of philosophy known as epistemology, theories of knowledge.
