- Category: #articles
- Summary: Trafigura bought oil futures to hedge against the risk of rising prices while purchasing physical oil to export to Singapore. However, they went overboard with their hedging, resulting in a speculative position that led to market manipulation allegations by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Additionally, Trafigura faced an insider trading charge for obtaining nonpublic information about the gasoline market.

#### Trafigura

Trafigura Group is a global commodity trading firm. It is essentially in the business of noticing that oil is cheap in one part of the world and expensive in another part of the world, buying the oil where it is cheap, loading it on ships, and moving it to where it is expensive. In January 2017, Trafigura noticed that oil was cheap on the US Gulf Coast and expensive in Singapore. So, [between January and March](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B1e821ec3), it “developed and deployed a large fuel oil export program designed to export fuel oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore in order to profit from the open arbitrage.” That is: It made a plan to buy a lot of oil on the Gulf Coast, put it on ships, move it to Singapore and sell it there. Specifically the plan was to deliver “approximately 3.5 million barrels of physical high-sulfur fuel oil … for delivery in Singapore in February, March, and  
April 2017.”[[1]](#footnote-1) 

This all takes time, and there was a risk that by the time Trafigura got the ships to Louisiana, etc., the oil there would be more expensive and the arbitrage wouldn’t work. So first things first: Before moving ships, buying physical oil, etc., Trafigura bought oil *futures* as a hedge.[[2]](#footnote-2) “Trafigura established a long derivative position in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil, in part as an economic hedge for its anticipated purchases of physical fuel oil to export to Singapore.” You buy 3.5 million barrels of oil futures at today’s price, and then you go out and buy actual oil over time to load on your ships.[[3]](#footnote-3) If the price of oil goes up while you are buying it, you don’t care: You pay more for the oil you’re buying, but you make more money on your futures. You’re hedged. 

Effectively, Trafigura saw a price signal — “oil is cheap in the Gulf and expensive in Singapore” — and responded in two ways. First financially (it bought futures to lock in the cheap Gulf price), and then physically (it went and actually moved the oil from Texas to Singapore). 

But it went overboard on its hedging: It bought more than 3.5 million barrels of futures. “The long derivative position entered into by Trafigura was in excess of its short physical position that resulted from plan to purchase fuel oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast for arbitrage—the excess  
essentially constituting a speculative position.” Instead of just hedging the price risk of its plan to buy 3.5 million barrels of oil in the Gulf, it made a financial bet on Gulf oil prices going up.

But it still had to buy 3.5 million barrels of actual oil in the Gulf to put on ships to send to Singapore. I said above that, because of its hedging, Trafigura should have been indifferent to the price it paid for that oil: If the price went up by $1 per barrel, it would pay $3.5 million more for the oil, but it would make $3.5 million on its futures, and those trades would offset. But of course with a long speculative position — with more than 3.5 million barrels of futures — that’s not quite true. Instead, Trafigura *wanted to pay a higher price* for the oil: If the price of Gulf oil went up by $1 per barrel, it would pay $3.5 million more for the oil, but it would make *more* than $3.5 million on its futures. 

Specifically, the way the market structure worked is that the futures settled against a benchmark oil price set in the Platts window:

> The Platts U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur Fuel Oil benchmark (the “USGC HSFO Benchmark”) is assessed from Platts’s offices in Houston, Texas. The benchmark is assessed by Platts using a “market-on-close” (MOC) methodology. ...

> Platts generally determines the USGC HSFO Benchmark for a given day based primarily on bids to purchase, offers to sell, and trades in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil during a defined period of time called the “window” that Platts authorized. …

> The settlement value of Trafigura’s long derivative position was based on the average of the daily Platts USGC HSFO Benchmark value for the 19 trading days during the month of February 2017. 

If you are an oil trader, and you have to buy a lot of physical oil, you have to make decisions about when and how you do it. Normally, you will want to buy oil as cheaply as possible. So you might do your buying quietly, without affecting the price much. You’d buy a little bit at a time, spread out over a long period. You might avoid buying too much during the Platts window, because your purchases during that window would very directly push up the benchmark price.

On the other hand, if you *want* the price to go up, you should just buy as sloppily as possible during the Platts window. Trafigura did:

> Beginning on February 1, 2017, and continuing through the end of the month, Trafigura bid heavily for and bought 80 cargoes (3.6 million barrels in total) of fuel oil in the Platts MOC trading window against its short physical position, an amount much larger than it had ever previously purchased in the window in a single month. Trafigura’s heavy bidding and buying activity in that short period tended to increase prices paid in the MOC window, and ultimately contributed to an increase in the daily Platts USGC HSFO Benchmark value, which benefitted Trafigura’s long derivatives position. Trafigura’s near exclusive use of the Platts window to source large quantities of fuel oil in one month departed from its past conduct, and the large volume created artificially high USGC HSFO Benchmark values throughout February 2017 that were not reflective of ordinary forces of supply and demand. This impact on the USGC HSFO Benchmark was to the detriment of market participants who looked to rely on the benchmark as a fair price reference of physical or derivatives trades.

The more it paid for its oil *while Platts was setting the benchmark price*, the higher that price would be, and the more money it would make on its futures position. 

I have been quoting, of course, from [the order](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8C1e821ec3) in a US Commodity Futures Trading Commission [enforcement action](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvUHJlc3NSb29tL1ByZXNzUmVsZWFzZXMvODkyMS0yNA/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B643b5b15) against Trafigura for market manipulation. Apparently buying all that oil at once is bad, and Trafigura agreed to pay $55 million to settle the case.

It’s a funny sort of manipulation. Trafigura was buying physical oil, in the quantities it needed, for a real economic purpose (to export it to Singapore). The *buying* was not itself manipulative. And it had those futures positions, in part, to hedge its price risk when it bought the oil. Given that, it *made sense* for Trafigura to buy during the Platts window: Its *hedge* was settled against the Platts window, so it should do its buying in the Platts window, to avoid any slippage between the hedge price and its actual buying price. So buying in the Platts window, to close out your Platts-based hedge, makes sense. It was just a bit too much: “The large volume created artificially high USGC HSFO Benchmark values throughout February 2017 that were not reflective of ordinary forces of supply and demand.” But you can see how a Trafigura trader could have thought “ah this is fine, we’re just buying to close out our hedge,” and then had the further thought “hmm that will push up the price, let’s put on some extra futures trades to profit from that.”

Anyway that CFTC enforcement action has two more interesting bits. Besides the market manipulation, there is an insider trading charge:

> Trafigura improperly obtained nonpublic information material to the gasoline market from [an employee of an unnamed “Mexican trading entity” (MTE)] in breach of the employer’s rules. Among other things, Trafigura received MTE’s pricing formulas used to sell its physical gasoline to another trading entity in Mexico, as well as the MTE’s monthly import “program,” meaning the volumes, types, and destination ports for gasoline the MTE planned to import in the next month. Trafigura also sometimes received competitor pricing information in the context of bilateral negotiations. The MTE considered this information confidential and material to its own business, while the information was material to Trafigura’s trading and business decisions, such as its negotiation and pricing strategies for gasoline products. Trafigura traders in Houston, Texas entered into physical and derivative gasoline transactions while knowing this confidential information.

Historically it was sort of lore that “insider trading in commodity markets is legal”: Traders in commodity markets tend to be producers or users of the commodity, and they will always have some sort of privileged information (about their own production, their discoveries, their needs, etc.) that others don’t have. But using *other* market participants’ inside information without their permission — getting the Mexican firm’s inside information and then trading based on that — is not allowed. “Trading commodities in interstate commerce or derivatives in knowing possession of material, nonpublic information disclosed in breach of a pre-existing duty violates” the rules, says the CFTC.

And then there is a bad nondisclosure agreement. We have [talked](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMTAtMDMvdGhlLXNlYy1oYWQtYS1idXN5LXdlZWs_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDYxODI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNjE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B46647314) a [few times](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDEtMTcvbWFraW5nLWVzZy1hLWNyaW1lP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MTgyNF9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTI0MDYxOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B2d232aa0) before about the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s war on NDAs. The way it works is:

1. The SEC has a “whistleblower protection” rule saying that companies can’t threaten or retaliate against their employees for reporting misconduct to the SEC.
2. Many firms have employees sign nondisclosure agreements that say something like “you won’t tell anyone any confidential information you get at our firm, and if you do we can sue you.”
3. The SEC interprets that as a threat against whistleblowers: Theoretically, you can read it to mean “you won’t tell anyone (including the SEC) any confidential information you get at our firm (including about our crimes), and if you do we can sue you (to retaliate for your whistleblowing).”
4. Therefore, those NDAs are illegal, and the SEC can extract fines from firms that have them, even if those firms would never dream of enforcing those NDAs against whistleblowers.

This is a good enough racket for the SEC that the CFTC is getting into it:

> Trafigura required its employees to sign employment agreements, and requested that former employees sign separation agreements, with broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited the sharing of Trafigura’s confidential information with third parties. These non-disclosure provisions did not contain carve-out language expressly permitting communications with law enforcement or regulators such as the CFTC. The provisions caused confusion that resulted in an impediment to voluntary and direct communications with the CFTC about possible violations of the [Commodity Exchange Act] and CFTC regulations in violation of the CEA’s prohibitions against impeding direct communications with the CFTC.

Two CFTC commissioners put out separate statements [objecting](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvUHJlc3NSb29tL1NwZWVjaGVzVGVzdGltb255L21lcnNpbmdlcnN0YXRlbWVudDA2MTcyNA/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8Bf545946e) to this [conclusion](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvUHJlc3NSb29tL1NwZWVjaGVzVGVzdGltb255L3BoYW1zdGF0ZW1lbnQwNjE3MjQ/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B07c5dad7), saying that it “empower[s] the Commission to line-item edit non-disclosure agreements” and “essentially wordsmiths job offer letters and other employment-related agreements with boilerplate confidentiality provisions.”

#### Pivot to AI (1)

A [standard story](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8wMy9wb2RjYXN0cy9oYXJkLWZvcmstY2hhdGJvdC10aWt0b2stY3J5cHRvLmh0bWw/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B0b42a695) in the modern tech industry is that every entrepreneur, venture capitalist, etc., was totally focused on crypto in 2020, and is totally focused on artificial intelligence in 2024. The “[pivot to AI](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jcnlwdG8tZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy1hcmUtcGl2b3RpbmctdG8tYWktaGVyZXMtb25lLWZvdW5kZXJzLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtMzRiZTRjNTE/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8Baf867d08)” is a [running joke](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmFkaWdtLWNyeXB0by12Yy1mdW5kLWluc2lzdHMtMTEyNjUxMDEzLmh0bWw_Z3VjY291bnRlcj0xJmd1Y2VfcmVmZXJyZXI9YUhSMGNITTZMeTkzZDNjdVoyOXZaMnhsTG1OdmJTOCZndWNlX3JlZmVycmVyX3NpZz1BUUFBQUkxSFJRNkFEc1F4dlhYZWpsREJCN29JX0JnZkxnOExzVnk4ZlVVY2F2NEM1Nk9jbjUzX2JhRWszQ0kySjIxcWVQb2Q0empTcFk5N1hWSlN3VUhCNjVVRk8xb3dVOWJHOWNQZmU3WWotUjNyMUtvbzctYVpYY2lHbi0xakZ5ZHF2TWlkVnVTY1c3eTlLRDhsZEwwd3poSHYwaHFNOUcyMC1GQUtwSG91VERLQg/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8Bed8224fe). It’s a joke in part because these things seem *unrelated**:* The skills required to build artificial intelligence, the problems that it solves, the potential uses, the *actual* real-world uses, are all so totally different from those in crypto. The “pivot to AI” can feel like just arbitrary chasing of hot buzzwords.

But a tech executive once pointed out to me that in fact crypto and AI are deeply related, and in fact the crypto boom (and bust) paved the way for the AI boom. The connection is *chips*. If you want to mine cryptocurrency, you need a lot of graphics processing units, the specialized computer chips that were previously sold mostly to computer gamers. And if you want to build a large language model, you need a lot of the same GPUs. So the crypto boom created a huge demand for GPUs, which led to GPU makers — by which I mean mostly Nvidia Corp. — scaling up their production of GPUs. And then the crypto bust created a huge *glut* of GPUs, because crypto miners no longer needed them, so companies that wanted to build LLMs could easily acquire lots of GPUs to train their models. That led to a transformative improvement in the power of those models. And now we are in an AI boom, with enormous demand for those chips. But crypto got us there.

I think it is conventional wisdom that this story has worked out better for Nvidia than for absolutely anyone else: It is the principal supplier of shovels in two of the greatest gold rushes of our time. However! One could quibble. [Bloomberg News reports](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDYtMTcvbnZpZGlhLWdldHMtc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1yZXZpZXctb24tc2hhcmVob2xkZXItY3J5cHRvLXN1aXQ_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDYxODI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNjE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8Bb82d3aa4):

> The US Supreme Court agreed to use a case over Nvidia Corp.’s crypto-mining revenue to consider making it harder for shareholders to press securities fraud lawsuits.

> Nvidia is seeking to stop an investor suit that accuses the company of being deceptive about how dependent it was on revenue from crypto mining before a 2018 market downturn. The justices said Monday they will hear Nvidia’s contentions that the complaint lacks enough specificity to go forward. ...

> In the newest case, the shareholders say that in 2017 and 2018 Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang hid the fact that record revenue growth was being driven by mining-related sales of the company’s flagship GeForce GPU product, rather than by sales for gaming.

> The investors say the cryptocurrency market’s volatility meant the company was exposed to more risk than it was revealing. The company said in November 2018 that had missed its revenue projections, sending shares tumbling more than 28% over two days.

> Huang at the time said a “crypto hangover” was to blame.

> “Analysts immediately recognized this as a reversal of NVIDIA’s prior reassurances that mining-related demand represented a small portion of revenues,” the shareholders told the Supreme Court.

Ah yes! Nvidia lulled its shareholders into believing that it was mostly a gaming company, so they bought its stock because they were optimistic about gaming, but really it was mostly a crypto company, and when the crypto market suffered setbacks in 2018 those shareholders lost money.[[4]](#footnote-4) And nothing else happened after that.

No, I’m kidding, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 1,700% since 2018, and the drop in November 2018 is barely visible on a chart. I suppose one day we will have to discuss the legal arguments in this lawsuit, but part of me thinks that the Supreme Court should dismiss it on the grounds of “you are Nvidia shareholders, come on, you’re fine.”

#### Pivot to AI (2)

The big multi-manager hedge funds tend to offer a specific, desirable product, and that product is “uncorrelated alpha.” The idea is that you hire a bunch of talented and hard-working stock pickers and make them pick stocks, but with no exposure to the broader market or to other common risk factors. So you can’t have market exposure: If you buy $100 million of stocks, you have to short $100 million of other stocks.[[5]](#footnote-5) You can’t have sector exposure: If you buy $100 million of tech stocks, you have to short $100 million of other tech stocks. And you can’t cheat by getting exposure to other factors: You can’t just buy small-cap stocks and short large-cap stocks; you have to keep your small-cap and large-cap exposure neutral. Et cetera: All the standard identified factors get neutralized out, and you’re left with no exposure to anything except the stock pickers’ skill. 

The pitch to investors is something like: If you are a big institutional investor, you will of course allocate some of your capital to *market bets*, buying the whole stock market or tech stocks or AI stocks or whatever, which will give you exposure to the broad stock market and to particular sectors that you like. Those bets are cheap: The fees on an S&P 500 index fund approach zero, and you can buy cheap factor-based funds that give you exposure to well-known risk premiums. But then you should also allocate some capital to the hedge fund, because it offers you a diversification benefit: It promises a return that is uncorrelated to your general stock market exposure. When the stock market goes down, the hedge fund won’t lose money, because it carefully hedges out all market exposure. You get your various market exposures — your betas — elsewhere, cheaply, and you pay the hedge fund a ton of fees for alpha.

This pitch has been very successful. But on the other hand, if you are giant multi-manager hedge fund, it can feel a bit wasteful. After all:

1. Your clients are allocating a lot of their capital to betting on the stock market and on particular hot sectors.
2. You would like more of their money.
3. Your employees are all hired for their skill at picking stocks.

Why aren’t *you* giving the clients their general stock exposure? Or part of it, anyway.[[6]](#footnote-6) It is tempting to offer the clients *two* (separate) products: uncorrelated alpha, and also a fund that buys the hot stocks. [Bloomberg News reports](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDYtMTgvc3RldmUtY29oZW4tcy1wb2ludDcyLXJlYWRpZXMtbmV3LWhlZGdlLWZ1bmQtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLWFpLXN0b2Nrcz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNjE4MjRfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yNDA2MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B8d44d168):

> Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is seeking to raise about $1 billion for a new stock-picking hedge fund focused on artificial intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter.

> The fund will bet on and against AI hardware and semiconductor companies globally and will be the firm’s first new hedge fund in decades, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Point72 currently has a main hedge fund along with some venture capital vehicles.

> Cohen has said he expects the impact of AI to be “transformational” and that it has the power to change how companies work and save them millions of dollars. …

> While Point72’s main fund is strictly market-neutral, the new vehicle will have a more flexible mandate, meaning it may hold some longer-biased positions not typically held in the main fund.

In its core product, investors are absolutely not paying Point72 to make big bets that AI will be transformational; they are paying Point72 for market-neutral uncorrelated alpha. But if Point72 *thinks* that AI will be transformational, and if investors *want* to pay it to make those bets, it should take their money.

#### Middle market

In a tech boom, investment banks spend a lot of time calling on tech startups. The goal is to cover lots of hot startups, to give them loans and help them do private fundraisings and visit them frequently and understand their business and generally lavish attention on them and make them feel special — “we’re just a teeny startup and a big bank’s chief executive officer called on us!” — because one day they will go public, and you want to have a good relationship so that you can lead their initial public offering and get a big fee.

In a private equity boom, I guess the move is to spend a lot of time calling on midsized ball bearings manufacturers, because eventually they are going to be acquired by a private equity firm, and you want to have a good relationship so that you can get the sellside mandate. [The Wall Street Journal reports](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2JhbmtpbmcvbWlkc2l6ZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtYXJlLWJpZy1idXNpbmVzcy1mb3Itd2FsbC1zdHJlZXRzLW1lZ2FiYW5rcy00ZGE4YTRkOD9tb2Q9aXRwX3dzag/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B695f3e83):

> Known for financing and advising megamergers, JPMorgan Chase is spending more of its resources on doing deals for companies valued at $2 billion or less.

> The goal is to leverage the relationships it has with the roughly 30,000 U.S. businesses—names such as fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group and virtual driving-range operator Topgolf—that get their checking accounts, lines of credit and payment processing from JPMorgan’s commercial bank. JPMorgan wants to provide them with investment-banking products and services when they need a loan, decide to go public or are acquired by a private-equity firm. 

> Big banks are moving deeper into territory normally reserved for smaller lenders. Many companies shifted their deposits to bigger banks during last year’s banking crisis, and some regional banks have scaled back lending as they adjust to the impact of higher interest rates. Meanwhile, big banks are going head-to-head with specialized boutiques, recognizing that advising on smaller deals helps them win repeat business from companies as they grow.

> There is another benefit for big banks: Midsize companies are a favorite target of private-equity firms. Buyouts for such businesses have remained relatively robust despite an overall decline in private-equity deals in recent years. Smaller buyouts are less affected by rising interest rates than bigger deals because they tend to rely less on debt.

I suppose you want the *buyside* mandate for *big* private equity deals, since the real money in those deals comes from doing the financing. But for the smaller deals, you maximize your chances of getting paid by having an in with the company.

#### How’s Martin Shkreli doing?

[Sure](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDYvMTEvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWFydGluLXNoa3JlbGktY29waWVkLXd1LXRhbmctY2xhbi1hbGJ1bS1sYXdzdWl0Lw/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B7e735657):

> Martin Shkreli has been sued in New York by a digital art collective that said it paid $4.75 million for a one-of-a-kind album by the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, only to learn that the convicted pharmaceutical executive made copies and is releasing the music to the public.

> Shkreli paid $2 million in 2015 for “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” and gave it up to partially satisfy a $7.4 million forfeiture order after his 2017 conviction for defrauding hedge fund investors and scheming to defraud investors in a drugmaker.

> The plaintiff PleasrDAO said Shkreli has, since his May 2022 release from prison, told fans on live streams and social media platform X that he kept and had shared the album, once saying, “I was playing it on YouTube the other night even though somebody paid $4 million for it.”

> PleasrDAO also said thousands of people tuned in on Sunday to hear the album on a live stream that Shkreli called a “Wu tang official listening party.”

> Such activity violates the forfeiture order, amounts to misappropriation of trade secrets, and “greatly diminishes and/or destroys the album’s value,” according to the complaint filed [last] Monday night in Brooklyn federal court.

All of this serves all of them right. Paying $4.75 million for a unique copy of an easily replicated digital object is such a crypto boom thing to do; this is like buying a Bored Ape nonfungible token and then complaining that someone right-clicked and downloaded the image. Nothing in the history of the world could have been more predictable than the fact that Martin Shkreli was going to pirate that Wu-Tang album, and it’s great that he did and also great that they sued him.

[1] Trafigura had two different legal entities in the US (Trafigura Trading LLC) and Singapore (Trafigura PTE, Ltd.), so it entered into a contract for the US entity to deliver 3.5 million barrels to the Singapore entity, leaving the US entity short 3.5 million barrels, a short that it would close out by buying oil in Texas. All otherwise unattributed quotes are from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [order](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8D1e821ec3).

[2] The CFTC does not explicitly say Trafigura bought futures (it says “derivatives”), and for all I know its hedging program involved some complex mix of listed futures, over-the-counter swaps and forwards, options, etc. But the story works if you assume it’s all futures, and I will use “futures” generically.

[3] And close out the futures, so you're not actually taking delivery of twice as much oil as you want.

[4] In 2018! Not even the real crypto winter of 2022.

[5] This whole paragraph is going to oversimplify in various ways. You’d weight the longs and shorts by beta, for instance. And some of the hedging might be done at the fund level rather than the portfolio, etc. The classic book is Giuseppe Paleologo’s “[Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant's Guide for Fundamental Investors](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lsZXkuY29tL2VuLWNhL0FkdmFuY2VkJTIwUG9ydGZvbGlvJTIwTWFuYWdlbWVudCUzQSUyMEElMjBRdWFudCdzJTIwR3VpZGUlMjBmb3IlMjBGdW5kYW1lbnRhbCUyMEludmVzdG9ycy1wLTk3ODExMTk3ODk4MDI/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B2da54a4a).”

<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Trafigura Group is a global commodity trading firm. It is essentially in the business of noticing that oil is cheap in one part of the world and expensive in another part of the world, buying the oil where it is cheap, loading it on ships, and moving it to where it is expensive. In January 2017, Trafigura noticed that oil was cheap on the US Gulf Coast and expensive in Singapore. So, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B1e821ec3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">between January and March</a>, it “developed and deployed a large fuel oil export program designed to export fuel oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore in order to profit from the open arbitrage.” That is: It made a plan to buy a lot of oil on the Gulf Coast, put it on ships, move it to Singapore and sell it there. Specifically the plan was to deliver “approximately 3.5 million barrels of physical high-sulfur fuel oil … for delivery in Singapore in February, March, and<br/>April 2017.”<a href="#footnote-1" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">
<span>[1]</span>
</a> </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">This all takes time, and there was a risk that by the time Trafigura got the ships to Louisiana, etc., the oil there would be more expensive and the arbitrage wouldn’t work. So first things first: Before moving ships, buying physical oil, etc., Trafigura bought oil <em>futures </em>as a hedge.<a href="#footnote-2" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">
<span>[2]</span>
</a> “Trafigura established a long derivative position in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil, in part as an economic hedge for its anticipated purchases of physical fuel oil to export to Singapore.” You buy 3.5 million barrels of oil futures at today’s price, and then you go out and buy actual oil over time to load on your ships.<a href="#footnote-3" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">
<span>[3]</span>
</a> If the price of oil goes up while you are buying it, you don’t care: You pay more for the oil you’re buying, but you make more money on your futures. You’re hedged. </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Effectively, Trafigura saw a price signal — “oil is cheap in the Gulf and expensive in Singapore” — and responded in two ways. First financially (it bought futures to lock in the cheap Gulf price), and then physically (it went and actually moved the oil from Texas to Singapore). </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">But it went overboard on its hedging: It bought more than 3.5 million barrels of futures. “The long derivative position entered into by Trafigura was in excess of its short physical position that resulted from plan to purchase fuel oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast for arbitrage—the excess<br/>essentially constituting a speculative position.” Instead of just hedging the price risk of its plan to buy 3.5 million barrels of oil in the Gulf, it made a financial bet on Gulf oil prices going up.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">But it still had to buy 3.5 million barrels of actual oil in the Gulf to put on ships to send to Singapore. I said above that, because of its hedging, Trafigura should have been indifferent to the price it paid for that oil: If the price went up by $1 per barrel, it would pay $3.5 million more for the oil, but it would make $3.5 million on its futures, and those trades would offset. But of course with a long speculative position — with more than 3.5 million barrels of futures — that’s not quite true. Instead, Trafigura <em>wanted to pay a higher price</em> for the oil: If the price of Gulf oil went up by $1 per barrel, it would pay $3.5 million more for the oil, but it would make <em>more </em>than $3.5 million on its futures. </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Specifically, the way the market structure worked is that the futures settled against a benchmark oil price set in the Platts window:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The Platts U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur Fuel Oil benchmark (the “USGC HSFO Benchmark”) is assessed from Platts’s offices in Houston, Texas. The benchmark is assessed by Platts using a “market-on-close” (MOC) methodology. ...</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Platts generally determines the USGC HSFO Benchmark for a given day based primarily on bids to purchase, offers to sell, and trades in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil during a defined period of time called the “window” that Platts authorized. …</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The settlement value of Trafigura’s long derivative position was based on the average of the daily Platts USGC HSFO Benchmark value for the 19 trading days during the month of February 2017. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">If you are an oil trader, and you have to buy a lot of physical oil, you have to make decisions about when and how you do it. Normally, you will want to buy oil as cheaply as possible. So you might do your buying quietly, without affecting the price much. You’d buy a little bit at a time, spread out over a long period. You might avoid buying too much during the Platts window, because your purchases during that window would very directly push up the benchmark price.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">On the other hand, if you <em>want </em>the price to go up, you should just buy as sloppily as possible during the Platts window. Trafigura did:</p>
<blockquote><p style="margin: 16px 0;">Beginning on February 1, 2017, and continuing through the end of the month, Trafigura bid heavily for and bought 80 cargoes (3.6 million barrels in total) of fuel oil in the Platts MOC trading window against its short physical position, an amount much larger than it had ever previously purchased in the window in a single month. Trafigura’s heavy bidding and buying activity in that short period tended to increase prices paid in the MOC window, and ultimately contributed to an increase in the daily Platts USGC HSFO Benchmark value, which benefitted Trafigura’s long derivatives position. Trafigura’s near exclusive use of the Platts window to source large quantities of fuel oil in one month departed from its past conduct, and the large volume created artificially high USGC HSFO Benchmark values throughout February 2017 that were not reflective of ordinary forces of supply and demand. This impact on the USGC HSFO Benchmark was to the detriment of market participants who looked to rely on the benchmark as a fair price reference of physical or derivatives trades.</p></blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The more it paid for its oil <em>while Platts was setting the benchmark price</em>, the higher that price would be, and the more money it would make on its futures position. </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">I have been quoting, of course, from <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8C1e821ec3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">the order</a> in a US Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvUHJlc3NSb29tL1ByZXNzUmVsZWFzZXMvODkyMS0yNA/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B643b5b15" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">enforcement action</a> against Trafigura for market manipulation. Apparently buying all that oil at once is bad, and Trafigura agreed to pay $55 million to settle the case.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">It’s a funny sort of manipulation. Trafigura was buying physical oil, in the quantities it needed, for a real economic purpose (to export it to Singapore). The <em>buying </em>was not itself manipulative. And it had those futures positions, in part, to hedge its price risk when it bought the oil. Given that, it <em>made sense </em>for Trafigura to buy during the Platts window: Its <em>hedge </em>was settled against the Platts window, so it should do its buying in the Platts window, to avoid any slippage between the hedge price and its actual buying price. So buying in the Platts window, to close out your Platts-based hedge, makes sense. It was just a bit too much: “The large volume created artificially high USGC HSFO Benchmark values throughout February 2017 that were not reflective of ordinary forces of supply and demand.” But you can see how a Trafigura trader could have thought “ah this is fine, we’re just buying to close out our hedge,” and then had the further thought “hmm that will push up the price, let’s put on some extra futures trades to profit from that.”</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Anyway that CFTC enforcement action has two more interesting bits. Besides the market manipulation, there is an insider trading charge:</p>
<blockquote><p style="margin: 16px 0;">Trafigura improperly obtained nonpublic information material to the gasoline market from [an employee of an unnamed “Mexican trading entity” (MTE)] in breach of the employer’s rules. Among other things, Trafigura received MTE’s pricing formulas used to sell its physical gasoline to another trading entity in Mexico, as well as the MTE’s monthly import “program,” meaning the volumes, types, and destination ports for gasoline the MTE planned to import in the next month. Trafigura also sometimes received competitor pricing information in the context of bilateral negotiations. The MTE considered this information confidential and material to its own business, while the information was material to Trafigura’s trading and business decisions, such as its negotiation and pricing strategies for gasoline products. Trafigura traders in Houston, Texas entered into physical and derivative gasoline transactions while knowing this confidential information.</p></blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Historically it was sort of lore that “insider trading in commodity markets is legal”: Traders in commodity markets tend to be producers or users of the commodity, and they will always have some sort of privileged information (about their own production, their discoveries, their needs, etc.) that others don’t have. But using <em>other </em>market participants’ inside information without their permission — getting the Mexican firm’s inside information and then trading based on that — is not allowed. “Trading commodities in interstate commerce or derivatives in knowing possession of material, nonpublic information disclosed in breach of a pre-existing duty violates” the rules, says the CFTC.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">And then there is a bad nondisclosure agreement. We have <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMTAtMDMvdGhlLXNlYy1oYWQtYS1idXN5LXdlZWs\_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDYxODI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNjE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B46647314" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">talked</a> a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDEtMTcvbWFraW5nLWVzZy1hLWNyaW1lP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MTgyNF9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTI0MDYxOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B2d232aa0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">few times</a> before about the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s war on NDAs. The way it works is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 40px; margin: 16px 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The SEC has a “whistleblower protection” rule saying that companies can’t threaten or retaliate against their employees for reporting misconduct to the SEC.</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Many firms have employees sign nondisclosure agreements that say something like “you won’t tell anyone any confidential information you get at our firm, and if you do we can sue you.”</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The SEC interprets that as a threat against whistleblowers: Theoretically, you can read it to mean “you won’t tell anyone (including the SEC) any confidential information you get at our firm (including about our crimes), and if you do we can sue you (to retaliate for your whistleblowing).”</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Therefore, those NDAs are illegal, and the SEC can extract fines from firms that have them, even if those firms would never dream of enforcing those NDAs against whistleblowers.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">This is a good enough racket for the SEC that the CFTC is getting into it:</p>
<blockquote><p style="margin: 16px 0;">Trafigura required its employees to sign employment agreements, and requested that former employees sign separation agreements, with broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited the sharing of Trafigura’s confidential information with third parties. These non-disclosure provisions did not contain carve-out language expressly permitting communications with law enforcement or regulators such as the CFTC. The provisions caused confusion that resulted in an impediment to voluntary and direct communications with the CFTC about possible violations of the [Commodity Exchange Act] and CFTC regulations in violation of the CEA’s prohibitions against impeding direct communications with the CFTC.</p></blockquote>

It’s a joke in part because these things seem <em>unrelated</em><em>: </em>The skills required to build artificial intelligence, the problems that it solves, the potential uses, the <em>actual </em>real-world uses, are all so totally different from those in crypto. The “pivot to AI” can feel like just arbitrary chasing of hot buzzwords.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">But a tech executive once pointed out to me that in fact crypto and AI are deeply related, and in fact the crypto boom (and bust) paved the way for the AI boom. The connection is <em>chips</em>. If you want to mine cryptocurrency, you need a lot of graphics processing units, the specialized computer chips that were previously sold mostly to computer gamers. And if you want to build a large language model, you need a lot of the same GPUs. So the crypto boom created a huge demand for GPUs, which led to GPU makers — by which I mean mostly Nvidia Corp. — scaling up their production of GPUs. And then the crypto bust created a huge <em>glut </em>of GPUs, because crypto miners no longer needed them, so companies that wanted to build LLMs could easily acquire lots of GPUs to train their models. That led to a transformative improvement in the power of those models. And now we are in an AI boom, with enormous demand for those chips. But crypto got us there.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">I think it is conventional wisdom that this story has worked out better for Nvidia than for absolutely anyone else: It is the principal supplier of shovels in two of the greatest gold rushes of our time. However!

<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The US Supreme Court agreed to use a case over Nvidia Corp.’s crypto-mining revenue to consider making it harder for shareholders to press securities fraud lawsuits.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Nvidia is seeking to stop an investor suit that accuses the company of being deceptive about how dependent it was on revenue from crypto mining before a 2018 market downturn. The justices said Monday they will hear Nvidia’s contentions that the complaint lacks enough specificity to go forward. ...</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">In the newest case, the shareholders say that in 2017 and 2018 Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang hid the fact that record revenue growth was being driven by mining-related sales of the company’s flagship GeForce GPU product, rather than by sales for gaming.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The investors say the cryptocurrency market’s volatility meant the company was exposed to more risk than it was revealing. The company said in November 2018 that had missed its revenue projections, sending shares tumbling more than 28% over two days.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Huang at the time said a “crypto hangover” was to blame.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">“Analysts immediately recognized this as a reversal of NVIDIA’s prior reassurances that mining-related demand represented a small portion of revenues,” the shareholders told the Supreme Court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Ah yes! Nvidia lulled its shareholders into believing that it was mostly a gaming company, so they bought its stock because they were optimistic about gaming, but really it was mostly a crypto company, and when the crypto market suffered setbacks in 2018 those shareholders lost money.<a href="#footnote-4" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">
<span>[4]</span>
</a> And nothing else happened after that.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">No, I’m kidding, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 1,700% since 2018, and the drop in November 2018 is barely visible on a chart. I suppose one day we will have to discuss the legal arguments in this lawsuit, but part of me thinks that the Supreme Court should dismiss it on the grounds of “you are Nvidia shareholders, come on, you’re fine.”</p>

So you can’t have market exposure: If you buy $100 million of stocks, you have to short $100 million of other stocks.<a href="#footnote-5" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">

Et cetera: All the standard identified factors get neutralized out, and you’re left with no exposure to anything except the stock pickers’ skill. </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The pitch to investors is something like: If you are a big institutional investor, you will of course allocate some of your capital to <em>market bets</em>, buying the whole stock market or tech stocks or AI stocks or whatever, which will give you exposure to the broad stock market and to particular sectors that you like. Those bets are cheap: The fees on an S&amp;P 500 index fund approach zero, and you can buy cheap factor-based funds that give you exposure to well-known risk premiums. But then you should also allocate some capital to the hedge fund, because it offers you a diversification benefit: It promises a return that is uncorrelated to your general stock market exposure. When the stock market goes down, the hedge fund won’t lose money, because it carefully hedges out all market exposure. You get your various market exposures — your betas — elsewhere, cheaply, and you pay the hedge fund a ton of fees for alpha.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">This pitch has been very successful. But on the other hand, if you are giant multi-manager hedge fund, it can feel a bit wasteful. After all:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 40px; margin: 16px 0;"> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Your clients are allocating a lot of their capital to betting on the stock market and on particular hot sectors.</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">You would like more of their money.</li> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Your employees are all hired for their skill at picking stocks.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Why aren’t <em>you </em>giving the clients their general stock exposure? Or part of it, anyway.<a href="#footnote-6" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: none !important; background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block;">

</a> It is tempting to offer the clients <em>two </em>(separate) products: uncorrelated alpha, and also a fund that buys the hot stocks. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDYtMTgvc3RldmUtY29oZW4tcy1wb2ludDcyLXJlYWRpZXMtbmV3LWhlZGdlLWZ1bmQtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLWFpLXN0b2Nrcz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNjE4MjRfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yNDA2MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B8d44d168" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">Bloomberg News reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is seeking to raise about $1 billion for a new stock-picking hedge fund focused on artificial intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The fund will bet on and against AI hardware and semiconductor companies globally and will be the firm’s first new hedge fund in decades, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Point72 currently has a main hedge fund along with some venture capital vehicles.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Cohen has said he expects the impact of AI to be “transformational” and that it has the power to change how companies work and save them millions of dollars. …</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">While Point72’s main fund is strictly market-neutral, the new vehicle will have a more flexible mandate, meaning it may hold some longer-biased positions not typically held in the main fund.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">In its core product, investors are absolutely not paying Point72 to make big bets that AI will be transformational; they are paying Point72 for market-neutral uncorrelated alpha. But if Point72 <em>thinks </em>that AI will be transformational, and if investors <em>want </em>to pay it to make those bets, it should take their money.</p>

<p style="margin: 16px 0;">In a tech boom, investment banks spend a lot of time calling on tech startups. The goal is to cover lots of hot startups, to give them loans and help them do private fundraisings and visit them frequently and understand their business and generally lavish attention on them and make them feel special — “we’re just a teeny startup and a big bank’s chief executive officer called on us!” — because one day they will go public, and you want to have a good relationship so that you can lead their initial public offering and get a big fee.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">In a private equity boom, I guess the move is to spend a lot of time calling on midsized ball bearings manufacturers, because eventually they are going to be acquired by a private equity firm, and you want to have a good relationship so that you can get the sellside mandate. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2JhbmtpbmcvbWlkc2l6ZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtYXJlLWJpZy1idXNpbmVzcy1mb3Itd2FsbC1zdHJlZXRzLW1lZ2FiYW5rcy00ZGE4YTRkOD9tb2Q9aXRwX3dzag/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B695f3e83" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">The Wall Street Journal reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Known for financing and advising megamergers, JPMorgan Chase is spending more of its resources on doing deals for companies valued at $2 billion or less.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The goal is to leverage the relationships it has with the roughly 30,000 U.S. businesses—names such as fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group and virtual driving-range operator Topgolf—that get their checking accounts, lines of credit and payment processing from JPMorgan’s commercial bank. JPMorgan wants to provide them with investment-banking products and services when they need a loan, decide to go public or are acquired by a private-equity firm. </p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Big banks are moving deeper into territory normally reserved for smaller lenders. Many companies shifted their deposits to bigger banks during last year’s banking crisis, and some regional banks have scaled back lending as they adjust to the impact of higher interest rates. Meanwhile, big banks are going head-to-head with specialized boutiques, recognizing that advising on smaller deals helps them win repeat business from companies as they grow.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">There is another benefit for big banks: Midsize companies are a favorite target of private-equity firms. Buyouts for such businesses have remained relatively robust despite an overall decline in private-equity deals in recent years. Smaller buyouts are less affected by rising interest rates than bigger deals because they tend to rely less on debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">I suppose you want the <em>buyside </em>mandate for <em>big </em>private equity deals, since the real money in those deals comes from doing the financing. But for the smaller deals, you maximize your chances of getting paid by having an in with the company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Martin Shkreli has been sued in New York by a digital art collective that said it paid $4.75 million for a one-of-a-kind album by the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, only to learn that the convicted pharmaceutical executive made copies and is releasing the music to the public.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Shkreli paid $2 million in 2015 for “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” and gave it up to partially satisfy a $7.4 million forfeiture order after his 2017 conviction for defrauding hedge fund investors and scheming to defraud investors in a drugmaker.</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">The plaintiff PleasrDAO said Shkreli has, since his May 2022 release from prison, told fans on live streams and social media platform X that he kept and had shared the album, once saying, “I was playing it on YouTube the other night even though somebody paid $4 million for it.”</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">PleasrDAO also said thousands of people tuned in on Sunday to hear the album on a live stream that Shkreli called a “Wu tang official listening party.”</p>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">Such activity violates the forfeiture order, amounts to misappropriation of trade secrets, and “greatly diminishes and/or destroys the album’s value,” according to the complaint filed [last] Monday night in Brooklyn federal court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">All of this serves all of them right. Paying $4.75 million for a unique copy of an easily replicated digital object is such a crypto boom thing to do; this is like buying a Bored Ape nonfungible token and then complaining that someone right-clicked and downloaded the image. Nothing in the history of the world could have been more predictable than the fact that Martin Shkreli was going to pirate that Wu-Tang album, and it’s great that he did and also great that they sued him.</p>

<div id="footnote-1" style="font-style: italic;">
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">[1] Trafigura had two different legal entities in the US (Trafigura Trading LLC) and Singapore (Trafigura PTE, Ltd.), so it entered into a contract for the US entity to deliver 3.5 million barrels to the Singapore entity, leaving the US entity short 3.5 million barrels, a short that it would close out by buying oil in Texas. All otherwise unattributed quotes are from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvbWVkaWEvMTA3OTEvZW5mdHJhZmlndXJhdHJhZGluZ29yZGVyMDYxNzI0L2Rvd25sb2Fk/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8D1e821ec3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">order</a>.</p>

<div id="footnote-2" style="font-style: italic;">
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">[2] The CFTC does not explicitly say Trafigura bought futures (it says “derivatives”), and for all I know its hedging program involved some complex mix of listed futures, over-the-counter swaps and forwards, options, etc. But the story works if you assume it’s all futures, and I will use “futures” generically.</p>
</div>
<div id="footnote-3" style="font-style: italic;">
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">[3] And close out the futures, so you're not actually taking delivery of twice as much oil as you want.</p>

<div id="footnote-5" style="font-style: italic;">
<p style="margin: 16px 0;">[5] This whole paragraph is going to oversimplify in various ways. You’d weight the longs and shorts by beta, for instance. And some of the hedging might be done at the fund level rather than the portfolio, etc. The classic book is Giuseppe Paleologo’s “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35759932.544573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lsZXkuY29tL2VuLWNhL0FkdmFuY2VkJTIwUG9ydGZvbGlvJTIwTWFuYWdlbWVudCUzQSUyMEElMjBRdWFudCdzJTIwR3VpZGUlMjBmb3IlMjBGdW5kYW1lbnRhbCUyMEludmVzdG9ycy1wLTk3ODExMTk3ODk4MDI/6660812d2886878bf3017ea8B2da54a4a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid; background-color: #ccc;" target="\_blank">Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant's Guide for Fundamental Investors</a>.”</p>
