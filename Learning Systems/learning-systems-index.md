## Overview
This research folder explores various approaches to knowledge acquisition and retention, providing comparative analysis and implementation strategies for optimal learning.

## Core Learning Methods
- [[learning-spaced-repetition]] - Memory retention through timed intervals
- [[learning-active-recall]] - Strengthening memory through retrieval practice  
- [[learning-feynman-technique]] - Understanding through simplified explanation
- [[learning-elaborative-interrogation]] - Deep comprehension via questioning
- [[learning-interleaving]] - Enhanced learning through topic mixing
- [[learning-dual-coding]] - Visual and verbal processing integration

## Analysis & Implementation
- [[learning-systems-comparative-analysis]] - Side-by-side method comparison
- [[learning-systems-implementation-guide]] - Practical application strategies
- [[learning-effectiveness-metrics]] - How to measure learning success

## Research Context
**Objective**: Identify the most effective learning approaches for different contexts and learning styles.

**Key Questions**:
- Which methods work best for different types of information?
- How can multiple approaches be combined effectively?
- What are the practical constraints and benefits of each system?

**Next Steps**: Complete individual method research → comparative analysis → implementation testing
