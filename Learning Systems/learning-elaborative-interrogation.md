## Core Concept
Elaborative interrogation involves generating explanations for why stated facts or concepts are true. This method promotes deeper processing by encouraging learners to ask "why" and connect new information to existing knowledge.

## Key Question Types
- **Causal Questions**: "Why does this happen?"
- **Functional Questions**: "What purpose does this serve?"
- **Comparative Questions**: "How is this similar/different from X?"
- **Consequential Questions**: "What are the implications of this?"
- **Historical Questions**: "Why did this develop this way?"

## Implementation Process
1. **Identify Key Facts**: Select important concepts or statements
2. **Generate Why Questions**: Ask for underlying reasons or causes
3. **Research Answers**: Find explanations through study or reasoning
4. **Connect Knowledge**: Link to previously learned material
5. **Test Understanding**: Verify explanations make sense

## Optimal Use Cases
- **Factual Content**: Historical events, scientific phenomena
- **Cause-Effect Relationships**: Understanding processes and mechanisms
- **Conceptual Learning**: Theoretical frameworks and principles
- **Domain Integration**: Connecting ideas across subjects

## Cognitive Benefits
- **Deep Processing**: Moves beyond surface-level learning
- **Knowledge Integration**: Builds connections between concepts
- **Critical Thinking**: Develops analytical reasoning skills
- **Transfer Enhancement**: Improves ability to apply knowledge

## Practical Techniques
- **Questioning Journals**: Written "why" questions and answers
- **Discussion Groups**: Collaborative exploration of reasons
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual representation of cause-effect chains
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Predicting reasons before confirming

## Limitations
- **Prior Knowledge Dependent**: Requires existing knowledge for connections
- **Time Investment**: More time-intensive than passive reading
- **Subject Suitability**: Less effective for arbitrary or procedural facts
- **Cognitive Load**: Can overwhelm beginners with complex material

## Research Evidence
Studies show 10-15% improvement in comprehension when learners generate explanations for facts. Most effective for learners with moderate prior knowledge.
