## Core Concept
The Feynman Technique involves explaining complex concepts in simple terms as if teaching someone else. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, this method reveals gaps in understanding and deepens comprehension.

## Four-Step Process
1. **Choose Concept**: Select topic to learn
2. **Explain Simply**: Write explanation in plain language
3. **Identify Gaps**: Find areas of confusion or complexity
4. **Refine & Simplify**: Return to source material and improve explanation

## Key Benefits
- **Deep Understanding**: Forces move beyond memorization to comprehension
- **Gap Detection**: Reveals specific areas needing more study
- **Retention Enhancement**: Teaching reinforces learning
- **Transfer Ability**: Improves application to new situations

## Implementation Strategies
- **Written Explanations**: Document simple summaries
- **Verbal Teaching**: Explain to friends, family, or pets
- **Analogies & Metaphors**: Connect to familiar concepts
- **Visual Diagrams**: Create simple illustrations
- **Progressive Refinement**: Multiple iterations of explanation

## Optimal Use Cases
- **Complex Theories**: Scientific, philosophical, or technical concepts
- **Abstract Ideas**: Mathematical proofs, economic principles
- **System Understanding**: How processes or mechanisms work
- **Interdisciplinary Topics**: Subjects requiring broad integration

## Limitations
- **Time Intensive**: Requires significant effort per concept
- **Surface-Level Facts**: Overkill for simple memorization tasks
- **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Need basic understanding to begin
- **Motivation Dependent**: Requires genuine interest in understanding

## Research Support
Studies show explaining concepts to others improves comprehension by 15-30%. Most effective for learners who already have some background knowledge.
