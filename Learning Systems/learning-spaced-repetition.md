## Core Concept
Spaced repetition leverages the psychological spacing effect - information is better retained when study sessions are distributed over time rather than massed together.

## Key Principles
- **Expanding Intervals**: Review material at increasingly longer intervals
- **Difficulty-Based Scheduling**: Harder items appear more frequently
- **Active Retrieval**: Testing memory rather than passive re-reading

## Implementation Methods
- **Digital Tools**: Anki, SuperMemo, Quizlet
- **Physical Systems**: Leitner box method with index cards
- **Integrated Approach**: Built into note-taking systems

## Optimal Use Cases
- **Factual Information**: Vocabulary, historical dates, formulas
- **Language Learning**: Grammar rules, pronunciation patterns
- **Medical/Legal Studies**: Precise terminology and procedures
- **Certification Prep**: Standardized test materials

## Limitations
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Less effective for complex reasoning
- **Creative Applications**: Limited benefit for artistic or innovative tasks
- **Time Investment**: Requires consistent daily practice
- **Setup Overhead**: Initial creation of cards/materials

## Research Evidence
Studies show 50-200% improvement in long-term retention compared to massed practice. Most effective when combined with [[learning-active-recall]] techniques.

## Related Methods
- Links naturally with [[learning-active-recall]]
- Enhanced by [[learning-elaborative-interrogation]]
- Can incorporate [[learning-dual-coding]] principles
