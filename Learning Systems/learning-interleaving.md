## Core Concept
Interleaving involves mixing different topics or problem types within a single study session, rather than focusing on one subject at a time (blocked practice). This approach enhances discrimination skills and improves transfer to new situations.

## Key Principles
- **Mixed Practice**: Alternate between different concepts or problem types
- **Spacing Variety**: Distribute different subjects throughout session
- **Discrimination Training**: Learn to distinguish between similar concepts
- **Context Variation**: Practice skills in different scenarios

## Implementation Strategies
- **Subject Rotation**: Switch between math, science, languages within session
- **Problem Type Mixing**: Combine different equation types in math practice
- **Skill Variation**: Practice related but distinct techniques together
- **Random Scheduling**: Use random generators to determine study sequence

## Optimal Use Cases
- **Skill Differentiation**: When concepts or procedures are similar
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Different equation or proof types
- **Language Learning**: Grammar rules, vocabulary categories
- **Pattern Recognition**: Visual or conceptual pattern identification
- **Athletic Training**: Multiple related skills or techniques

## Cognitive Mechanisms
- **Enhanced Discrimination**: Better ability to identify which approach to use
- **Reduced Interference**: Less confusion between similar concepts
- **Improved Transfer**: Skills apply better to new situations
- **Flexible Retrieval**: Multiple pathways to same information

## Research Findings
Studies show 10-40% improvement in transfer tasks compared to blocked practice. Benefits increase over time and are most pronounced in complex domains.

## Implementation Challenges
- **Initial Discomfort**: Feels less organized than blocked practice
- **Slower Initial Progress**: Acquisition seems slower (but retention better)
- **Planning Complexity**: Requires more sophisticated study scheduling
- **Motivation Issues**: Can feel less rewarding in short term

## Contraindications
- **Complete Beginners**: May overwhelm learners with no base knowledge
- **Highly Dissimilar Topics**: No benefit when subjects share no commonalities
- **Time-Pressured Situations**: Less efficient for immediate recall needs

## Complementary Methods
- Works well with [[learning-spaced-repetition]] scheduling
- Enhanced by [[learning-active-recall]] testing
- Benefits from [[learning-elaborative-interrogation]] questioning
