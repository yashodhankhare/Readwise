## Highlights
- What has happened at this point is that a previously unknown unknown has now become a known unknown, and consequently is now already factored into investor risk appetite and market positioning, and so it ceases to have much impact on market prices. And this is true regardless of whether the underlying economy is weak or not, because the economy does not drive stocks prices - demand and supply do. At this point, and in contrast to the intuitions most recently-scared investors harbour, a further market crash actually becomes extremely unlikely, and those sitting in cash hoping for more of the same are very likely to have their hopes dashed.
  This is why markets almost always bottom well before the real economy, and recover in a manner that confounds most investors. Right when the majority of investors have just finished selling down, raising cash, and positioning themselves cautiously and in preparation for the 'coming downturn' and the 'buying opportunities' sure to emerge therefrom, markets start to rally and the opportunities they had hoped and expected to encounter swiftly disappear. The buying opportunities are not created by the economic downturn per se, but investors preparing for the economic downturn by raising cash.
  They are left high and dry holding a bunch of cash. They are confused, and perhaps even angry at the market for behaving so irrationally, and ignoring how bad things are in the real economy. They claim investors are ignoring economic realities. They say the rally must be a dead cat bounce. They say bear market rallies are common and investors are being fooled by it. They say investors are too optimistic on the speed of the recovery. They say it's because investors are overly acclimated to 'buying the dip', etc. They use every excuse they can muster to avoid admitting to themselves the sad reality that they may have sold at the bottom, just like patsies do every bear market. What they are really doing is hoping markets go back down so they have a second chance to buy stocks as cheap as they were recently trading, but with so many cashed-up investors similarly hoping for a further pull back, such an outcome is inherently self-defeating. There is simply too much cash on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to buy the second dip for markets to go down enough to retest their lows.
  There never has been, and never will be, a law of the universe that dictates that stocks will go down just because the economy remains weak, and the actual truth is that markets almost never go down much - if at all - when investors are already cautiously positioned for a known unknown, and are already holding a lot of cash in preparation for a difficult and uncertain future. They go down a lot when people go from being aggressively positioned to defensively positioned en mass, because they were not previously expecting future turmoil/economic stress, and they now are. Once people are defensively positioned, markets are apt to rise because the selling pressure of people moving into a defensive position abates, and there is far more latent buying lying in wait (i.e. all the cash people raised to take advantage of buying opportunities), and too few sellers left.
  In markets, people can tolerate things being bad; *what they can't tolerate is extreme uncertainty*.
  The second reason is that the degree of uncertainty for investors radically diminishes. When you enter into a downturn and the economy continues to worsen, investors feel like they are walking into a dark tunnel, and the further they walk in, the darker and scarier it gets. They know, intellectually, that the tunnel has a finite duration, but they don't know how long the tunnel is and how dark it is going to get. So long as it keeps getting darker and darker, anxieties worsen. There is a lack of any sense of hope, and it becomes easier for investors to entertain worst-case scenarios, and start to view them as base case likelihoods. 'What if the tunnel goes on not just for hours, but for days, weeks, months, or even years?!', 'What if the tunnel has no end at all!?'. 'What happens if I'm actually walking around in circles and don't realise it!?" 'What if there are strange creatures or undiscovered species of monsters lurking in this tunnel'!?
  However, at some point, a very faint light at the end of the tunnel emerges. At this stage, the psychology changes. Now sure - there is still a hell of a lot of really dark tunnel to walk through, which is a real drag (i.e. the economy is going to remain extremely weak for quite some time yet), but now not only is there a renewed sense of hope, but one can also start to form a more sensible and realistic assessment of how dark it is likely to be and for how long, when before one had no idea. The degree of uncertainty diminishes, which allows investors to more rationally assess and quantify the probable economic damage, and the realistic degree of impact on companies' earnings and balance sheets, and increasingly wild speculation about improbable worst case scenarios also tends to ease up. And owing to the market's propensity to significantly overreact in the short term, in almost all cases, such rational assessments reveal that markets have been massively oversold.
  Firstly, an aside on uncertainty: the reality is that the future is *always* uncertain; it just *feels*more uncertain to investors at certain times. *This is because, as noted, the primary risk in markets is **not** known unknowns, but unknown unknowns*. Six months ago, the outlook felt more certain, but little did we know that covid-19 was about to emerge and wreak havoc with the global economy and financial markets. *Risk comes from the fact that unknown unknowns exist in the world, and by definition, such unknowns cannot be foreseen.*
  Furthermore, the amount of opportunity that exists in markets is directly proportional to the level of uncertainty or perceived uncertainty that exists, because markets/people *hate* feeling uncertain. That is because investors/people are not comfortable thinking in terms of probabilities - they like black and white, yes and no answers - something I have also blogged about in the past - and if they can't feel sure they know what is going to happen, they don't feel like they can act. But that is not rational - you can weigh the probabilities, and you *must,* because there is no other way to operate in markets - *at any time*. And as a buyer, the more uncertain the outlook the better, because the market systematically underprices assets in an environment of uncertainty. Using a high level of uncertainty as a justification for sitting on one's hands may sound sage and prudent, but it is actually foolish.
  The truth is, the very best opportunities in markets - whether they be at the market, industry, or individual stock level - always exist in situations where there are novel events or changes happening that render past analogies obsolete. It disorients investors and makes them uncomfortable investing. That is how stocks get very cheap. Great investors are the ones who are original thinkers and are able to reason from first principles *without* requiring the crutch of analogy.
  *Being a good investor is fundamentally about the ability to form reasonable judgments in the face of uncertainty and incomplete evidence.* If you can't do that, you will feel compelled to wait until the uncertainty is resolved and all the evidence is in, but by that stage the opportunity will no longer exist. The default to lazy, analogy-laden thinking will not work in novel situations, and it can also lead you astray in other situations where analogies lead to important nuances being missed.
