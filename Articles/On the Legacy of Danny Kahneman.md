## Highlights
- For stock-pickers such as ourselves, we must be conscious of the fact that Danny didn’t think very highly of our industry. Here he is in “Thinking Fast and Slow”:
  ‍“…my questions about the stock market have hardened into a larger puzzle: a major industry appears to be built largely on an illusion of skill. Billions of shares are traded every day,with many people buying each stock and others selling it to them. Most of the buyers and sellers know that they have the same information, and they exchange stock primarily because they have different opinions. What makes them believe they know more about what the price should be than the market does? For most of them, that belief is an illusion.”
  He then describes that it is psychology that drives the illusion. He describes that we all are part of a “powerful professional culture” that can “maintain an unshakeable faith” in any proposition, “however absurd”, because that faith in skill over luck is “sustained by a community of like-minded believers.” He continues with the primary driver of this faith:
  “The most potent psychological cause of the illusion is certainly that the people who pick stocks are exercising high-level skills. They consult economic data and forecasts, they examine income statements and balance sheet, they evaluate the quality of top management, and they assess the competition. All this is serious work that requires extensive training…but unfortunately, skill in evaluating the business prospects of a firm is not sufficient for successful stock trading, where the key question is whether the information about the firm is already incorporated in the price of its stock.”
  But what if the stock price is incorporating the wrong information? Perhaps Kahneman is leaving a small crack in the window for all of us stock-pickers out there. It was Kahneman & Tversky (1979) themselves that showed us how we all become risk seeking when facing losses and risk averse when facing gains. This observation in fact became a theoretical underpinning behind the intermediate-term momentum phenomenon. The authors essentially were telling us that human beings (and perhaps Mr. Market himself) can incorporate the wrong public information.
  So maybe ignoring the wrong information and focusing on unbiased analysis of the right information is ***the only*** way to be skillful in stock trading?
  ‍**And maybe, spotting this overemphasis on wrong information (good or bad) – as predicted by behavioral finance – is the very skill required to “beat” Mr. Market.**
  Importantly, Danny Kahneman himself, the one who identified many of the behavioral biases affecting us in the first place, states that awareness of the bias doesn’t prevent even him from making the same behavioral mistakes that humans are apt to make.
  In other words, Danny might say we have our work cut out for us, but at least he has laid down the foundation for the problem we are trying to solve. 
  In order for us to succeed – and by succeeding I mean generating alpha – we will need to have an investment regime which a) recognizes the difficulties of correcting our own biases, and b) fosters a culture to ensure as much objectivity as possible.
  Those that don’t will only succeed if they are lucky.
  Or cheat.  And we don’t cheat.
