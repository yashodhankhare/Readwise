## Highlights
- # [[Gamblers Fallacy]] - Chance has no memory
  - "I got a speeding ticket yesterday, so now I can cross the speed limit again," said John.
  - Even criminals suffer the gambler's fallacy. Studies show that repeat criminals expect their chance of getting caught to be reduced after being caught and punished unless they are extremely unlucky.
  - Mary finds it comforting knowing it will take another 99 years until the next giant storm happen.
  - What is a "100-year storm?" To predict storms we look at past statistics i.e., how often in the recorded past a storm of a certain magnitude has occurred. We also assume that the same magnitude of storm will occur with the same frequency in the future. `A 100-year storm doesn't mean it happens only once every 100 years. It could happen any year. If we get a once in 100-year storm this year, another big one could happen next year. A 100-year event only means that there is a 1% chance that the event will happen in any given year. So even if large storms are rare, they occur at random. The same reasoning is true for floods, tsunamis, or airplane crashes. In all independent events that have random components in them, there is no memory of the past.` (Page 5)

- "There's growing evidence that some firms are shipping goods ahead of the risk of tariffs under a Trump presidency," the TD analysts note. "Central banks have likely taken comfort from low core goods prices (as an offset to sticky services), but if this disappears, inflation's downward momentum might slow sharply and keep central banks on hold later this year."
  There's no reason to think that higher shipping rates will spark as strong a reaction in inflation as the one we saw during the pandemic, necessarily.
  And of course, no one knows exactly how the US election is going to shake out exactly. But it's interesting that, months ahead of the event and without a clear idea of the future policy mix, we're already talking about the longer-term economic effects of another big moment of economic uncertainty.

- - I keep hearing “Should I buy? Should I buy?” When I start hearing “Should I sell?” that’s the bottom.
  - When a falling stock becomes a screaming buy because it cannot conceivably drop further, try to buy it 30 percent lower.

- Jerry Seinfeld talking with Howard Stern on finding the pain you're comfortable with:
  "Seinfeld: I'm never not working on material. Every second of my existence, I'm thinking, could I do something with that? 
  Howard Stern: That, to me, sounds torturous. 
  Seinfeld: Your blessing in life is when you find the torture you're comfortable with."

- # Probabilities: Subjective and Objective
  1. There are two broad categories of probability interpretations. The first is called physical probabilities, more commonly referred to as frequency probabilities. They are commonly associated with systems that can generate tons of data over very long periods. Think roulette wheels, flipping coins, and card and dice games. But frequency probabilities can also include probability estimates for automobile accidents and life expectancy. Yes, cars and drivers are different, but there are enough similarities among people driving in a particular area that tons of data can be generated over a multiyear period that in turn will give you frequency-like interpretations. 
  2. When a sufficient frequency of events, along with an extended time period to analyze the results, is not available, we must turn to evidential probabilities, commonly referred to as subjective probabilities. It is important to remember, a subjective probability can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent the “subjective” plausibility. According to the textbooks on Bayesian analysis, “if you believe your assumptions are reasonable, it is perfectly acceptable to make your subjective probability of a certain event equal to a frequency probability.” What you have to do is to sift out the unreasonable and illogical in favor of reasonable. 
  3. A subjective probability, then, is not based on precise computations but is often a reasonable assessment made by a knowledgeable person. Unfortunately, when it comes to money, people are not consistently reasonable or knowledgeable. We also know that subjective probabilities can contain a high degree of personal bias. 
  4. Any time subjective probabilities are in use, it is important to remember the behavioral finance missteps we are prone to make and the personal biases to which we are susceptible. A decision tree is only as good as its inputs, and static probabilities—those that haven’t been updated—have little value. It is only through the process of continually updating probabilities with objective information that the decision tree will work. 
  5. Whether or not they recognize it, virtually all decisions investors make are exercises in probability. To succeed, it is critical that their probability statements combine the historical record with the most recent data available. That is Bayesian analysis in action.

- Cooper had heard Colbert say previously that he had learned to “love the thing that I most wish had not happened.” He asked Colbert to clarify this extraordinary statement and this was his answer….
  “It’s a gift to exist, and with existence comes suffering,” replied Colbert. “I don’t want it to have happened . . . but if you are grateful for your life . . . then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can’t pick and choose what you’re grateful for.”

- # Semantics, Story telling, Narratives and Investing
  1. Are descriptions important in investing? You bet they are. But our study of descriptions will not take us to the mathematics department; that part will come later. Rather, we will stay with the philosophy curriculum and next meet someone who is arguably the most distinguished philosopher of the twentieth century. Bertrand Russell described him as “the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.”
  2. To help us better understand how this new philosophy of meaning actually worked, Wittgenstein drew a very simple three-sided figure. 
  3. He then writes, “Take as an example the aspects of a triangle. This triangle can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical drawing, as standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a mountain, as a wedge, as an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object, which is meant to stand on the shorter side of the right angle, as a half parallelogram, and as various other things…. You can think now of this now of this as you look at it, can regard it now as this now as this, and then you will see it now this way, now this.” It is a compelling, even poetic way to describe his belief that reality is shaped by the words we select. Words give meaning. 
  4. How does this relate to investing? As we will see, stocks have a lot in common with Wittgenstein’s triangle.
  5. On May 15, 1997 Amazon became a publicly traded company. There have been many bull and bear cases about Amazon over the years. Is Amazon best described as a company that is similar to Barnes & Noble,  Walmart or to Dell?
  6. Mandelbrot was right. Failure to explain is caused by failure to describe. Wittgenstein lives. The words we choose give meaning (description) to what we observe. In order to further explain and/or defend our description, we in turn develop a story about what we believe is true. There is nothing wrong with storytelling. In fact, it is a very effective way of transferring ideas. If you stop and think, the way we communicate with each other is basically through a series of stories. Stories are open-ended and metaphorical rather than determinate. Think back to our first chapter where Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors We Live By) remind us that we fundamentally think and act metaphorically. Today, scientists and philosophers have dropped the word “storytelling” and instead use the word “narrative.” Indeed, it appears that “narrative” has now slipped into the mainstream.
  7. And yes, investors use narratives. There is a narrative about the economic recovery following the financial crisis. There is a narrative about inflation following the massive printing of money used to combat the financial crisis. There is a narrative for deflation, which tells the depressing story of how the massive debt levels accumulated over the past decade will take years to pay down, causing prices and wages to fall.

- IN MEDITATION WORKSHOPS and retreats, a common theme is to develop the skill of observing experiences without judging them. Instructors advise attendees to notice through the “sense doors” of one’s eyes, ears, mouth, and bodily movements—pre-verbally, if you can. Is it possible to really tune in to the texture and flavors of the food that you’re tasting, even before you label it “good” or “bad”? Can you take in the sound of a bird chirping, perhaps even before your mind steps in with the word bird? You might find it quite difficult to notice experiences without automatically judging them. However, the process of trying to register sensations first, even before interpretations and judgments emerge, can help shift old patterns. The effort itself can make a difference in how you react to what’s going on, both within yourself and in response to the outside world.

- Brain activity involves two specific networks: the task positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN)—the latter of which we looked at in chapter 1. When one network is active, the other network is much less active, and vice versa. A third network, the salience network, is involved in switching between the two. The task positive network (TPN) dominates when you are paying attention to something in the present moment. If you’re engaged in your work, playing sports, making music, or pursuing another task in a focused way, TPN activity is prominent. Brain regions involved in the TPN include the lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, and the somatosensory cortex. When you’re not doing much of anything, your brain is still quite busy. The DMN (including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and the hippocampal formation) is active—passing information along, modifying it, and processing it—in habitual ways such as rumination (thinking about the same things over and over again, especially memories and past experiences, without active problem-solving), self-referential thinking (thinking about yourself, in the usual ways that you do that), and judgment (deciding whether things are good, bad, or neutral).
  The DMN isn’t all bad, and we need it to survive. The DMN helps us connect the past, present, and future, and helps us maintain our identity and our understanding of the world. We couldn’t really get along without it. We need to be able to predict what might be needed in an upcoming situation, and to remember people and other information. The neuroscientist Marcus Raichle asserts that the DMN provides integration that is necessary for survival.

- Meditation - Using a Mantra
  1. Here’s how to do the TM method. First, you need a mantra. There are three ways to get one: 1. Join the TM organization and a teacher will select a personalized Sanskrit mantra for you. 2. Select your Sanskrit mantra from the Internet. (There are several sources. Google “Mantra selection.”) 3. Make up your mantra (Reference, The Relaxation Response, by Herbert Benson, M.D.) Benson recommends the word “One,” as an example.
  2. Second, find a quiet area, sit in a comfortable chair, relax your body, and relax your mind. It is not always possible to find the perfect spot or time. Learn to overcome distractions so you can meditate anywhere, at any time.
  3. Third, close your eyes and become aware of the line of thoughts moving through your mind. You can’t stop them. Don’t try. Don’t judge them, just become aware of them. Then, in you mind, gently and quietly say your mantra. The subtle interruption will divert your train of thinking momentarily, but the train will continue. As you become aware of your thoughts again, quietly say your mantra to yourself. Do not repeat your mantra in a rhythmic fashion and don’t control your thoughts. Each time you repeat this process, you will go to a slightly deeper state of mind. There are times, after you become a veteran meditator, when you may experience the sensation that you are an observer of someone thinking those thoughts (and that’s a pretty cool ah-ha.)
  4. Twenty minutes, twice a day is recommended but do what you can. One time is better than not doing it, and even five minutes is better than zero minutes.

- I love this one: “Fail early, fail often, fail forward.” You know, it’s always a little bit frustrating to me when people have a negative relationship with failure. Failure is a massive part of being able to be successful…. You gotta take a shot, you have to live at the edge of your capabilities. You’ve got to live where you’re almost certain you’re going to fail. That’s the reason for practice. Practice is controlled failure; you’re getting to your limit until you get to the point where all of a sudden, your body makes the adjustment and then you can do it. Failure actually helps you to recognize the areas where you need to evolve. So fail early, fail often, fail forward. —Will Smith (2018)

- A lesson in the risk-free rate
  With his selling of Apple and buying of Occidental Petroleum, Buffett is giving investors an important lesson in the risk-free rate and how it can affect your investing decisions.
  Today, Berkshire Hathaway has a cash pile approaching $300 billion sitting in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. These bills earn around 5% in yield every year and can be considered the risk-free rate for investors. Why? Because you can compare them to the earnings yield of other stocks in your portfolio.
  An earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E and tells you how much in earnings you are yielding each year from a company, based on the current stock price. Apple's earnings are not growing, and it has a P/E of close to 35. Invert that P/E, and you have an earnings yield of 2.9%. Buffett is saying he would rather own Treasury bills than get a 2.9% yield owning Apple stock.
  But what if we look at Occidental Petroleum's earnings yield? Take one divided by 12.6, and its earnings yield is 7.9%. That is much higher than the current Treasury yield. While it's not the entire story for any stock, comparing the earnings yield to the risk-free rate is a good way to gauge whether you should buy the stock. This likely came into consideration when Buffett was selling Apple and buying shares of Occidental Petroleum.

- Reflexivity - we affect what we reflect - It’s like the Perversity of Risk mental model
  How do human beings react to inflation and how can we use it for identifying ‘seasonality’? “In the short term, [inflation] is good for borrowers and not for lenders. Once a lender begins anticipating it, that equation changes, because he’s going to say, ‘I expect inflation, so I’m going to charge you more than I would otherwise charge you.’ And you get higher interest rates, and the interest rates keep up with the inflation. And in fact, human nature, they see inflation rising for a while, they begin anticipating still higher inflation. So they say, ‘I’m not only going to make up for today’s inflation, but I’m going to anticipate tomorrow’s inflation.’” - Paul Volcker

- What are 1-Way vs 2-Way Doors?
  1. Making decisions can be anxiety-provoking as we worry about what will go wrong. And, sometimes, we enter “analysis paralysis” as we strive to reduce our uncertainty. 
  2. In Amazon’s 2016 letter to shareholders (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm), Jeff Bezos encourages us to allocate decisions into one of two buckets:
  3. Reversible ‘2-Way Door’ Decisions: we make a call, and it’s relatively easy to change it if we discover it’s not working out as we’d hoped. 
  4. Irreversible ‘1-Way Door ‘ Decisions: once we’re in, we’re not coming back out. From Jeff B: “These decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before.”
  5. In our professional lives, 1-way door decisions could be quitting a job, acquiring a company, or making a major tech platform change. 
  6. In our personal lives, they could be getting married, going closely-cropped if we currently sport long hair, or moving to a new country (like our Mayflower friends). 
  7. All of these are technically reversible but would take years and potentially large amounts of pain.
  8. Connecting this to a favourite children’s book, Alice may return from Wonderland after she tumbles down the rabbit hole, but she’s going to reemerge forever changed.

- Human Failure v/s System Failure #[[Known Unknowns]]
  - "Our technology was foolprof. How could this happen?" Many systems fail because they focus on the machines, not the people that use them.
  - For example, a study of anesthesiologists found that human error was involved in 82% of preventable accidents. The remainder was due to equipment failure.
  - Even if the probability that some technology works is 99.99%, human fallibility makes the system less reliable than technological reliability alone. Humans are involved in designing, execution and follow-up. - Excluding ignorance and insufficient knowledge, given the complexity of human and non-human factors interacting, there is a multitude of ways in which things can go wrong.

- #[[Possibilities not Probabilities]]
  - After the September 11, 2001, catastrophe, Warren Buffett wrote on the importance on focusing on actual exposure and how using past experience sometimes may be dangerous:
  - In setting prices and aso in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed the possibiliy of large scale terrorism losses.... In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we might expect to incur from windsorm, fire, explosion and earthquake. But what will be the largest insured property loss in history ( after adding related business interruption claims) originated from none of these forces. In short all of us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience , rather than exposure, thereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium.
  - Experience, of course, is a highly useful staring point in underwriting most coverages. For example, it's important for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the past century have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale. This information will not tell you the exact probability of a big quake next year, or where in the state it might happen. But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are writing a huge statewide policy....
  - At certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually dangerous. Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance ("D&O") are likely to be relatively rare. When stocks are rising, there are a scarcity of targets to sue, and both questionable accounting and management chicanery often go undetected. At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&O may look great.
  - But that's just when exposure is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings manipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities. When stocks fall, these sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.

- #[[Stock Picking]] #Checklist
  [00:41:56] **Bryan Lawrence:** Yep. Yeah, it was 04. I found myself in a room with him and it was a meeting, I think, organized by Alice Schroeder for stock pickers with Buffett. And there were maybe 15 or 20 of us in that room and he was telling us about what stock picking was like and the questions we were asking him kind of all boiled down to how do we become like you, but faster?
  * And he said, well, unfortunately that's not going to happen. It's a long game, but two pieces of good news. He said as long as you believe in American capitalism, you should expect. progress, the general ups, upturn. As long as you don't do stupid things, you should do well as the market grows in general, as the economy grows in general, but the real tailwind for you is that the average share price of a stock goes up and down by 80 percent in a year.
  * **Bryan Lawrence:** And I remember thinking to myself, that's just insane. I, he's, I get him on the first point, but on the second point he's lost his marbles. So I went back to New York and got out of electronic version of Value Line and started crunching the numbers. There were. I think it might have been 4, 500 public companies, publicly traded companies back.
  * **Bryan Lawrence:** I think we're down to 3, 800 now. The numbers are still the same. If you take 52 week high divided by 52 week low, subtract one for every one of the, let's say 4, 000 publicly traded companies in the United States. And so it's a percentage by which the 52 week high has exceeded the 52 week low. Each year and you crunch these numbers, you go back 20, 25 years, you find that in a calm year, which is basically every two or three years, I'm sorry, two or three years out of every four is a calm year.
  * [00:43:41] **Bryan Lawrence:** Average stock in the S&P goes up and down by 40 percent in the Russell 2000, smaller companies goes up and down by 60 percent and in a crisis here, like you have a pandemic or a financial crisis or an invasion of Ukraine or something, things go up and down by 100 or 150%. So Buffett by picking 80 percent was picking this average number.
  * [00:43:59] **Bryan Lawrence:** And it's extraordinary, big companies like, I think in the Grant's talk, I was talking about Google. I mean, Google should, Google in the last year has traded between the low 90s and 150. Google, okay, how many people use Google? It's more than a billion users of each one of seven of its services.
  * [00:44:16] **Bryan Lawrence:** How many people cover Google? For an investor, one of you, how many people understand Google? Basically, if you're a sentient being on Earth with a smartphone, you know what Google is. And yet, the value of its stock is varied. By 70%, 65 70 percent the last 52 weeks that's like an extraordinary if you've done the work to understand the business and the crisis of confidence comes in it, it gives a very rich opportunity because what you can do during the month or so that it's having that crisis of confidence, trans time in the middle of which sells, replacement parts for aircraft in March and April of 2020 as air travel came to an end.
  * [00:44:52] **Bryan Lawrence:** You could quickly do work to see that it could survive for three years with no air travel. And so the stock went from, I don't know, 600 to 200. You could buy a lot of transom, and now the stock is 1, 100. That's what we do.

- The [[Subconscious Mind]]
  - Basically, there are four states of mind: beta, alpha, theta, and delta.  Beta is the awake state where your mind is active and aware of what’s going on around you. 
  - When you are in alpha, a door to your subconscious opens. When this door is open, you can program your subconscious. If you “try” to program your subconscious in the beta state, that door is closed so you will be talking to your conscious mind. Your conscious mind is critical and analytical. When you give yourself a goal in the awake state to your conscious mind, it will come up with a dozen logical reasons why you can’t achieve it.
  - Because your conscious mind can only do one thing at a time, doing every day chores would take up most of its capacity. Nature has taken care of this by creating habits. When you do the same routine many times, the routine becomes a habit. Habits are created in your subconscious mind so they are unconscious. Then, your conscious mind is free to do something else.

- # “Earned Secrets - Operating on Auto Pilot”
  - The first time you execute a complex motion, you talk yourself through it with your conscious mind. And, you do it one step at a time because your conscious mind can only do one thing at a time.
  - Take something more complex, like a golf swing. I was taught there are 31 elements to a good golf swing. The first few times I swung a club, I thought about each step.  This step-by-step motion produced a swing like a flickering old-time movie.  It wasn’t until each step was turned over to my subconscious, which can do a zillion things at a time, that my swing became fluid.
  - When a complex task is performed by the subconscious, it is:
  - Easy because your subconscious can handle an unlimited number of tasks at one time,
  - Effortless because it’s unconscious,
  - Graceful because it is a unified, coordinated motion, and
  - Natural because you don’t have to think about it.
  - That’s too much to think about. Each shot must be made a habit and performed at a subconscious level without that pesky conscious mind getting in the way.
  - Getting your conscious mind out of the way and “letting” your subconscious play the ball is not always easy. Your conscious mind has an ego that thinks it knows better, so it wants to be in control. Two “bads” happen when your conscious mind takes charge of your pickleball play.
  - One, you can’t play well when you are thinking, “I gotta hit a winner; Should I hit a dink or smash it? Why did I hit that last shot into the net? That was dumb; What’s the matter with me? Look at all those people watching me.”
  - Two, and even worse, you start thinking about winning or losing. These thoughts introduce some degree of fear—the fear of losing or the fear of being embarrassed. Any aspect of fear undermines confidence and sends your game down the tubes.
  - Here’s how to get your conscious mind out of the way: use your conscious mind’s limitation (i.e., that it can only think of one thing at a time) to your advantage. Keep your conscious mind preoccupied with watching the ball. Your conscious mind’s job is exclusively to focus on the ball. Think, “ball” as you watch it. Be aware of its flight path, its velocity, etc. If you concentrate on the ball, your conscious mind cannot interfere with your inner athlete, your subconscious. In a nutshell, when your conscious mind is focused on the ball, your subconscious mind is free to make that perfect shot.

  - 59 minutes mark - “And then I like to think about future states of the world, future states with regard to the company's competitive situation, the industry and the economics and the valuation of the company at that time. And then when I invest, I make my decision to invest today only based on the expectation of what will the company be worth at that point in time and now, like as if there was no intermediate time. And this is why I use this analogy with a toaster.
  - Like because when I toast my bread, when I put my bread into the toaster, the decision to toast it is based on the expectation of the high conviction that I will get a warm piece of bread at the end when the toaster is done doing its thing. I do not care if it's sort of being warmed constantly and becoming constantly warmer and warmer towards its form, or whether it's cold for three minutes and then in the end sort of dramatically flamed, you know, like it doesn't matter. Or I want to be convinced that I will receive a warm loaf of bread at the end.
  - And it's actually sort of super basic, but I think a lot of public market investors, they don't just think in a totally different way. They think so much more about the interim period when the bread is inside the toaster. How warm is it now in the toaster?
  - Like it doesn't matter because you're not eating the bread now. You're eating the bread when it's warm.
  - So, so, so, yeah. Then you can increase the temperature if you want to and try to make it go faster. But if you put it on the highest, then usually you burn yourself.
  - Yeah. Same for investors.”

- Your body reflects what you eat. Your mind reflects what you consume.
  For a healthy body, choose whole foods. For a sharp mind, choose lasting knowledge.
  What’s lasting knowledge?
  It’s wisdom that endures: Timeless principles, foundational ideas, and insights that remain relevant for years, not hours.
  Before diving into the news or scrolling through feeds, ask: “Will this still matter next year?” If not, it’s probably mental junk food. The sugar high will leave you craving even more.
  Avoid mental junk food. Feed your mind substance. Your future self will thank you.

- Act as an exemplar [[Inner Scorecard]]
  Wealth is a blessing to those who know how to use it, a curse to those who don't, - Publius Terentius
  Observe what signals you send out. Charles Munger tells us that some people have a duty to create the right appearance: "A person who rises high in the Army or becomes a Supreme Court justice is expected to be an exemplar, so why shouldn't someone who rises high in a big corporation act as an exemplar?" 
  He continues:
  You don't want your first grade teacher to be fornicating on the floor or drinking booze in the classroom. Similarly, I don't think you want your stock exchange to be all over the headlines. because of its wretched excess. And I certainly don't think that you want to turn the country's major stock exchange into even more of a casino than it is already.
- What does cognitive therapy do, and why does it work?`
  Cognitive therapy, particularly in its form as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is a psychological treatment that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. Here’s a breakdown of what cognitive therapy does and why it is effective:
  What Cognitive Therapy Does:
  - Identifies Negative Thoughts: CBT helps individuals recognize inaccurate or unhelpful thinking patterns that contribute to emotional distress and behavioral issues12.
  - Challenges Negative Beliefs: The therapy encourages patients to question and reframe these negative beliefs, promoting a more balanced perspective34.
  - Teaches Coping Strategies: Patients learn practical skills to manage their thoughts and emotions, which can lead to improved responses to challenging situations56.
  - Addresses Various Conditions: CBT is effective for a range of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)78.
  Why Cognitive Therapy Works:
  - Empirical Support: Numerous studies have demonstrated that CBT leads to significant improvements in functioning and quality of life98. It is often recommended as a first-line treatment for various mental health conditions.
  - Focus on Skills Development: By equipping individuals with cognitive and behavioral skills, CBT empowers them to handle future challenges more effectively32.
  - Structured Approach: The structured nature of CBT allows for measurable progress and clear goals, making it easier for patients to see their improvements over time102.
  In summary, cognitive therapy works by helping individuals understand and alter their thought processes, leading to better emotional regulation and behavior. This approach is supported by extensive research, making it a widely accepted and effective treatment method for many psychological issues.

- Shane Parrish: Talk to me about some of your favourite stories or lessons you learned from him (Munger).
  Chris Davis: Well, it would be a book. If I was to think of a couple of the things that mattered, there were things that mattered personally in a way that was very surprising in my personal life. I went through an unexpected divorce, and I was having dinner with Charlie, and he was saying, "I generally am not a fan of divorce because people don't tend to do better." It tends to be about a fantasy, and it tends to reflect sort of a lack of realism. All of the things he said about marriage over the years are so interesting--about trying to be deserving of the partner that you would like to find and so on.
  Charlie was a tough critic, and he never held back telling me when he thought I was foolish or stupid, but I felt so deeply supported, too. It was like the hardest teacher you've ever had. The hardest teacher you've ever had is a tough critic, but you feel they're rooting for you. That's part of what makes them your favourite.
  I felt like that with Charlie. But at one point, Charlie said, "Well, it's very hard to be blamed for someone else's unhappiness." And just those words. And in this moment, that was for me quite a low point in my life and a time when it felt quite traumatic. Just the grace of that phrase--that it's very difficult to be blamed for someone else's unhappiness. And there can come a time when it's just too much. And he said it's particularly hard if you're wired in a way that you love somebody and you want to help them. You're trying to make them happy. So he said it can get to a point where that's just too much.
  That was something that I wouldn't know how to describe that in any other format. It wasn't an investment lesson per se, but it was one that was very, very helpful to me. The story now is out. It was something that he had said to me when I was asking him about his happiness and how he owed his debt of happiness, and he said he owed it to his wife's first husband.

  LIBRARIAN: "Of course, this demands having a prepared mind."
  SEEKER: "Yes, I first have to understand what works and not -how else can I find a solution or know what to do?"
  LIBRARIAN: "And never make important decisions when you are tired."
  MUNGER: "When we started, we didn't know this modern psychological evidence that you shouldn't make decisions when you were tired and how tiring it is to make decisions...I can't remember an important decision Warren has made when he was tired. "
  LIBRARIAN: "Sometimes it also helps to remove you from the problem and do something else. Let the unconscious mind go to work - distance gives perspective. As the German physicist Helmholtz said on his 70th birthday, After investigating a problem in all directions, happy ideas come unexpectedly, without effort, like an inspiration. So far as I am concerned, they have never come to me when my mind was fatigued, or when I was at my working table... They came particularly readily during the slow ascent of wooded hills on a sunny day!" 
  "And to put your unconscious to work, you need to give it time."

- #[[Do Nothing]]
  “A lot of the things that people waste time doing in business, they don’t have to do with us. I mean, there’s an awful lot of time spent in some businesses just preparing for committee meetings, and directors meetings, and all kinds of things like that, show-and-tell stuff. And none of that’s needed with us. We won’t go near them. And so, we really free them up to spend a hundred percent of the time thinking about what is good for the business over time.” —Warren Buffett (1995)
  “Yeah. I think our chief contribution to the businesses we acquire is what we don’t do.” —Charlie Munger (1995)
- #[[Marriage]]
  MUNGER: "It reminds me of the old quote, where the husband asks, 'Will you still love me if I lost all my money?' And the wife replies: I will always love you but I will miss you terribly.'" 
  SEEKER: "On the other hand, as someone once said, 'Money cannot buy-love, but it places one in an excellent bargaining position.'"
  LIBRARIAN: "Maybe, but as Benjamin Franklin said, 'Where there's marriage without love, there will be love without marriage.'"

  1. Instead of trying to change others, we should look inward and see if we can change ourselves. 
  2. We cannot selectively numb emotions, we end up numbing the positive emotions as well. 
  3. We seem to have an inclination to talk AT people, and not talk TO people. 
  4. If we stay passionate enough and keep asking the right questions , we tend to make changes in ourselves.

- # Delusion Two: The delusion of correlation and Causality #[[Halo Effect]]
  A famous statistician once showed a precise correlation between arrests for public drunkenness and the number of Baptist preachers in nineteenth-century America. The correlation is real and intense, but we may assume that the two increases are CAUSALLY unrelated, and that both arise as a consequence of a single different factor (the X factor): a marked general increase in the American population. - Stephen Jay Gould - Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin, 1996
  If we want to answer the mother of all business questions- What leads to high performance?-one thing is already clear: We have to avoid the Halo Effect. 
  We have to gather data in ways that are unaffected by performance, so that independent variables are measured separately from the thing we're trying to explain. 
  Arrests for public drunkenness and the number of Baptist preachers in nineteenth-century America may have been closely correlated, but we can't say much about whether one caused the other. Did the level of drunkenness lead to greater attention about morality in society and therefore a demand for preachers? Or did an abundance of preachers drive Americans to drink? Or were both of them the result of something different -namely, growth in the overall population? If all we have is a correlation, we really don't know.
  Inferring causality from correlation trips up many studies about business. Take something as basic as, say, the relationship between employee satisfaction and company performance. It’s logical to think that having satisfied employees ought to lead to high performance. After all, satisfied employees might be willing to work harder and longer, and might care more about keeping their customers happy. It sounds right. We know not to measure employee satisfaction simply by asking employees, "Are you satisfied?" since the answers will likely be colored by the Halo Effect. But suppose we look at a measure that is not tainted by Halos-say, the rate of employee turnover-and we find a high correlation with performance. Now the challenge is to untangle the direction of causality.
  Does lower employee turnover lead to higher company performance? Perhaps, since a company with a stable workforce might be able to provide more dependable customer service, spend less on hiring and training, and so forth. Or does higher company performance lead to lower employee turnover? That could be true as well, since a profitable and growing company might offer a more stimulating and rewarding environment as well as greater opportunities for advancement. Knowing which leads to which is critical if managers want to know what to do-how much they should invest in greater levels of satisfaction versus other objectives.
  The point is that a correlation, by itself, explains nothing.
- Skin In The Game - Taleb
  - For investors, Taleb's most salient observations came in the final chapter, "The Logic of Risk Taking," where he compared two different ways of analyzing risk —"ensemble probability" and "time probability." Recall the two ways of thinking about gambling that helped define a ruin problem. In one, a hundred gamblers bet $1,000 on roulette. Some win, some lose it all. If gambler 59 goes bust, that has no impact on gambler 60, and the average profit of the group might be $10 per bet. That's "ensemble probability."
  - Next, a single gambler makes one hundred bets on the roulette wheel, putting all his money on red. Such a gambler will never make it to a hundred. That is the "time probability" way of looking at risk, which is path-dependent in time.
  - It is, Taleb argued, the correct way to think about risk— especially when there's a chance of ruin. And while it might seem obvious that "time probability" is how the real world works, it's not how much of modern finance weighs market odds.
  - Modern finance theory favors taking the average of all the bettors and using that as a proxy for the risk individual gamblers take. According to this view, the odds of surviving a round of Russian roulette are 83 percent—not so bad. And a risk practically no one would take, even if offered $1 million.
  - Taking an average of a collective series of bets hides the risk of disaster-of gamblers' ruin. As Taleb wrote in Skin in the Game, "never cross a river if it is on average four feet deep." By thinking of risk in this way, "more than two decades ago, practitioners such as Mark Spitznagel and myself built our entire business careers around it.... While I retired to do some flaneuring, Mark continued relentlessly (and successfully) at his Universa."
  - These scenarios of interconnected, self-reinforcing extreme risk are precisely where the precautionary principle applies. In the "time probability" realm, each roll of the dice or spin of the wheel is connected to the other. They can't be separated into independent units that are averaged out. In much the same way, systemic risk occurs when there are correlations and connections between people facing risks. One person dying in a bathtub won't increase the risk that his neighbor will die in a bathtub. One person dying of an infectious disease does increase the risk that his neighbor will get sick and die. When such risks become systemic, posing potential ruin to society as a whole, extreme precaution is required.

  - One of the things that I noticed recently, and you may infer why I'm even asking you this, is throughout your whole career at Amazon, it appears to me like you paid yourself about $80,000 a year in total.
  - Yeah.
  - Cash, comp. And never took additional equity in the company the entire time.
  - No, I never did. And I asked the comp committee of the board not to give me any comp. And my view was I was a founder, I already owned a significant amount of the company, and I just didn't feel good about taking more. I felt I had plenty of incentive. It was, I owned more than 10% of the company, before it was diluted by various things, more than 20% of the company. And I just felt, how could I possibly need more incentive than owning such a, most founders own big chunks of the company. They don't really need, they're more like owner operators. `The way they increase their wealth is not by getting more equity. They just wanna make the equity they have more valuable.`And so I never, I just would have felt icky about it. And I really, I'm actually very proud of that decision. I sometimes wish that there were a, and maybe you can do this, Andrew, or maybe the Washington Post will do this, but somebody needs to make a list where they rank people by how much wealth they've created for other people. And so instead of the Forbes list, ranks you by your own wealth. So Amazon's market cap is 2.3 trillion today. I own about 200 billion ish of it. So if you take 2.3 billion and subtract out the piece I kept for myself, then I've created something like 2.1 trillion of wealth for other people. That should put me pretty high on some kind of list. And that's a better list. How much wealth have you created for other people? You know, people like Jensen and NVIDIA, he's going to be very high on that list. And that would be a pretty cool list. Somebody should do that list.” [[Incentives]]

- Moreover, the heart of creative work is not creation, but expression. To merely create is to bring into being what was not there before. It is now a fairly trivial operation for an AI model to “create” in this limited sense, by producing new variations on an existing data set. To express is different. To express is to bring into existence something that speaks of something else. An AI tool can create a new sea shanty or a new sculpture or a new abstract shape. But what can it express through these? To express is to have something inside oneself that needs to come out. It pushes its way out: of your mouth, your diaphragm, your gesture, your rhythmic sway. Or you pull it out—because it resists translation, resists articulation.
