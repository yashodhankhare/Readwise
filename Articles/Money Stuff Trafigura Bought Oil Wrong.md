## Highlights
- But a tech executive once pointed out to me that in fact crypto and AI are deeply related, and in fact the crypto boom (and bust) paved the way for the AI boom. The connection is *chips*. If you want to mine cryptocurrency, you need a lot of graphics processing units, the specialized computer chips that were previously sold mostly to computer gamers. And if you want to build a large language model, you need a lot of the same GPUs. So the crypto boom created a huge demand for GPUs, which led to GPU makers — by which I mean mostly Nvidia Corp. — scaling up their production of GPUs. And then the crypto bust created a huge *glut* of GPUs, because crypto miners no longer needed them, so companies that wanted to build LLMs could easily acquire lots of GPUs to train their models. That led to a transformative improvement in the power of those models. And now we are in an AI boom, with enormous demand for those chips. But crypto got us there.
