## Highlights
- Stocks with daily closing prices slightly above round numbers (e.g., $6.1) tend to rise and outperform stocks priced just below round numbers (e.g., $5.9) by 24.6 basis points the following day. This pattern is robust to various stock characteristics and is consistently observed over intraday half-hour intervals and in 18 international equity markets. I attribute this predictable movement to limit order clustering: stocks priced just above (or below) round numbers receive support (or resistance) from an excessive volume of limit orders clustered at round levels, primarily placed by retail investors. Moreover, this order clustering hinders the incorporation of public information into prices during post-earnings announcement periods and contributes to the short-term reversal effect. These findings reveal the profound impact of retail investor behavior on price dynamics and overall market efficiency. 
  It sounds sort of like superstition to say “this stock is at $6.05, so it is unlikely to go below $6,” but apparently that is somewhat true.
