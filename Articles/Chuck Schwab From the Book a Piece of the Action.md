## Highlights
- The way the discounters went about their business violated too many of the ancient truisms of the brokerage business. “Stocks are sold, not bought” went one such axiom—meaning that most Americans still did not come easily to a decision to buy or sell a stock or bond. They had to be cajoled, prodded, convinced. Brokers activated this process by picking up the phone, planting an idea, slowly reeling in the customer. Ross Kenzie, the longtime manager of Merrill Lynch’s Cleveland office, was legendary within the firm for the way he supposedly trained new brokers: in order to impress upon them the importance of making phone calls, he used to tape one of their hands to the phone during their first week on the job.12 At Schwab, however, it was the customer who had to pick up the phone. Employees were supposed to sit at their desks and wait for people to call; then, when people did call, they were under explicit instruction not to offer advice or suggestions. Their job was to write down the caller’s order, and pass it along the Schwab pipeline, where other employees made the trade and billed the caller. At that point, of course, the caller became a customer, with an “account” at Schwab. Yet even then, no one at Schwab solicited additional business, something a wirehouse would have done as a matter of course. Discounters were operating on a different theory, which grew out of another truism of the brokerage business: “Ten percent of the customers provide 90 percent of the revenues.” It was this 10 percent, the most active investors, that discounters hoped to attract—investors who knew their own minds, and were tired of the incessant phone calls from their brokers. In one of his first ads, Schwab’s slogan was: “Call us because no sales person will ever call you.” Although Schwab would always trumpet this difference between his firm and the wirehouses, he was to some degree making a virtue out of necessity. The path he chose was every bit as preordained as Regan’s post-Mayday path. The same arithmetic that applied to Regan applied to him: it was simply impossible to employ full-service brokers earning commissions while offering cut-rate commissions to customers. Thus he hired glorified telephone operators and paid them around $10,000 a year, because that’s what he could afford.13 An even more onerous straitjacket was an SEC regulation called the know-your-customer rule. It said that a broker couldn’t give a customer advice until he understood something of the customer’s circumstances. Once a broker knew (for example) that his client was an elderly man dependent on dividend income, he was expected—nay, he was bound—to suggest an appropriately conservative portfolio. Paradoxically, the only legal way the discounters could get around the know-your-customer rule was by knowing nothing about their customers’ financial circumstances. You couldn’t be accused of giving out inappropriate advice if you gave out no advice at all. Schwab’s no-advice policy, besides being cost-effective, kept him on the right side of the law. The creation of the discount business was, in hindsight, another of those moments that one could find from time to time in this early phase of the money revolution—a moment when you could see a subtle shift taking place between buyer and seller. Unlike the big firms, the discounters were placing the onus on the buyer to make his own decisions, and to take greater responsibility for his financial actions. And on some deep level, Schwab understood this. But no one can ever remember him talking about it in the beginning. He was too busy trying to survive.
