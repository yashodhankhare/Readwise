## Highlights
- A move followed by a sideways range often precedes another move of almost equal extent in the same direction as the original move. Generally, when the second move from the sideways range has run its course, a counter move approaching the sideways range may be expected.
  Reversal or resistance to a move is likely to be encountered:
  A. On reaching levels at which in the past, the commodity has fluctuated for a considerable length of time within a narrow range.
  B. On approaching highs or lows.
  Watch for good buying or selling opportunities when trend lines are approached, especially on medium or dull volume. Be sure such a line has not been hugged or hit too frequently.
  Watch for crawling along or repeated bumping of minor or major trend lines and prepare to see such trend lines broken.
  Breaking of minor trend lines counter to the major trend gives most other important position taking signals. Positions can be taken or reversed on stop at such places.
  Triangles of ether slope may mean either accumulation or distribution depending on other considerations, although triangles are usually broken on the flat side.
  Watch for volume climax, especially after a long move.
  Donâ€™t count on gaps being closed unless you can distinguish between breakaway gaps, normal gaps, and exhaustion gaps.
  During a move, take or increase positions in the direction of the move at the market the morning following any one-day reversal, however slight the reversal may be, especially if volume declines on the reversal.
