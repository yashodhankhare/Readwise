## Highlights
- After the Global Financial Crisis, Bar-Yam began studying the complex system that is the stock market. He claimed to have helped discover a phenomenon that skeptics such as Taleb maintained was impossible—a system to predict market crashes, just like Didier Sornette’s LPPLS model could detect Dragon Kings. In April 2011, Bar-Yam and a team of NECSI researchers produced a paper that identified internal market mechanisms that they claimed foretold a crash. When a bunch of stocks start moving up or down together—a trend the researchers called mimicry—that’s a sign that the market is poised for panic, according to the study, which analyzed market crashes going back to 1985. “We have demonstrated mathematically that there is significant advance warning to provide a clear indicator of an impending crash,” Bar-Yam boasted.
