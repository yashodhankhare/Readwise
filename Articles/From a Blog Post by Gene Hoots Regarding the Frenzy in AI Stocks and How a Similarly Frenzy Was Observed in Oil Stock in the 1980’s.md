- Full Title: From a Blog Post by Gene Hoots Regarding the Frenzy in AI Stocks and How a Similarly Frenzy Was Observed in Oil Stock in the 1980’s
- Category: #articles

## Highlights
- The only market forecast I have ever believed, and my favorite, is this from economist Herbert Stein, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” This is easy enough to accept after it stops, but in frenzy and enthusiasm, it is easy to suspend belief in the statement.
